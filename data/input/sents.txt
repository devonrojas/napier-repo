The testimony I propose to adduce is founded on personal observations made in different parts of the Highlands including Easter Ross the Black Isle Badenoch Lochaber Rannoch Athole Strathtay Strathbraan Braemar Breadalbane and Lochaweside
I have also during the last forty years sought every opportunity of acquiring authentic information from old people belonging to the north some of them centenarians whose memories clear and distinct reached back to a period close on the Rebellion of  I have had important opportunities of knowing the condition of the land question not only in this country but in America where I was editor of the Produce Exchange Bulletin of New York
The result of my inquiries was to satisfy me that the disabilities of the Highlanders originated from three distinct laws the game laws the law of hypothec and the laws of entail and primogeniture
As your time is short I shall pass over a variety of matters and go into the exact state of affairs as they stand at present and the main causes of distress in the Highlands
 Within the last thirty or at all events fifty years there has been a falling off in the material productions of the entire north country of not less than  per cent with a consequent injury to the population of the Highlands
Instead of improving as other parts of the country has done the section alluded to has retrograded and there is now less food and other products raised there than there was at the Rebellion of  or at the commencement of the century
The introduction of the blackfaced breed of sheep about a hundred years ago and the more recent raising of Cheviots helped greatly to increase the prosperity of the north country but these advantages have been more than counterbalanced by the enormous increase of sporting grounds both for grouse and deer
So far from the Highlands being overpeopled they are greatly understocked for by the present methods of cultivation there is abundance of room for three times the number of inhabitants now in that country
It is true that in certain centres the number of families on the land has dangerously increased owing to the people being huddled together in townships where they have heedlessly been allowed to squat and where they have become utterly demoralised or at any rate pauperised
Before the Highlanders were removed from their native glens famines were unknown and they suffered less from deficient harvests than the inhabitants of the low country
This is pretty evident from the large number of stalwart recruits furnished to the army and the navy and there were few if indeed any districts in the empire which turned out larger contingents than did the now unfortunate island of Skye
The counties of Sutherland and Ross furnished the rank and file of the rd Highlandersthere being only thirtysix out of  not belonging to the country and this corps was considered the most stalwart of any foot soldiers under the Crown proving incontestibly that they could not have been reared in a faminestricken country
It is not then to the natural infertility of the Highlands that the present and former famines are to be attributed but to unwise arrangements made in regard to the management of the landed estates more particularly in the Hebrides
Further there is not the least reason to fear that if more enlightened and more humane counsels prevailed such calamities as those of last season would again require to call forth public sympathy and benevolence
While great changes for the worse have taken place in the Highlands it is proper to notice that in one respect there has been quite a change for good and that too in a very important matter
With but a few exceptions very few indeed thirty years ago the landowners and factors were a cruel and heartless race who cared nothing for the feelings or interests of the people who had been born and bred on their properties and they drove them away to America or to the large towns as unceremoniously as they did flocks of sheep or herds of black cattle
Now with the exception of the Duke of Argyll his factor or chamberlain and a few others the landlords enjoy the respect which they certainly deserve of the people whose destinies are to a certain extent confided to their care
No kinder or more considerate owners of land ever lived in the Highlands or elsewhere than Lady GordonCathcart and Lord Macdonald and their representatives seem actuated by a like noble spirit
Tormore and Mr MDonald Portree are quite different men from those who had the management of the Breadalbane and other Highland properties since I recollect
Now the crofters and cottars are treated with becoming consideration and civility whereas formerly they were generally spoken to as if they were a horde of drunken tinkers squatting on a lawn and as was stated by one of them in Breadalbane  we are not thought of so much account as a pheasant or a pointer dog
At the beginning of this century the shooting of moorfowl had not become fashionable and very small sums were received by proprietors for the privilege of shooting over their heathery wilds
Game preservation in the times of our grandfathers was confined to keeping down foxes hawks and eagles and poaching excepting in the two royal forests of Glenartney and Benachrombeg since named Glen Tilt was an unknown offence
While the letting of moors for grouse shooting has enriched landed proprietors all over the Highlands owing to the abundance of the heather to be found there without which the grouse cannot thrive there has been a corresponding and progressive injury to the country
Every sovereign paid by south country sportsmen to Highland lairds is just so much of a premium given for keeping the country desolate and for crushing down whatever native industry existed among the clansmen of the land of Alban
But for the heathfowl there are now thousands of fine slopes in the northern counties and millions of acres lying unproductive comparatively which would have been planted with the hardy Pinus scotus or the rapidlygrowing Swiss larch so valuable for railroad and other purposes
Such forests would have greatly sheltered the country and sensibly have improved the climate
They would have afforded abundance of employment for the spare time of crofters and cottars just as the districts of Athole and Breadalbane have done for half a century past and where in consequence there is to be witnessed as hardy industrious and intelligent a population as can be found in any part of the world
On the small estate of Dalguise as well as on the surrounding properties of Kinnaird Craig Vinean Ladywell Murthly c forests have produced  per acre per annum which but for said plantations would not have yielded more than Is per acre for sporting purposes
Then but for the grouse there are millions of acres of heathery wastes which would have been smiling under grass capable of yielding double the quantity of beef and mutton and wool now sent from the Highlands to southern markets
From an economic point of view the grouse reared in the north which cost the country so much is of no account as an article of food
Such a writer as Adam Smith would not have claimed for the heathfowl any more protection or consideration than for a wood pigeon or wild duck
The raising of grouse by the artificial and legislative inventions has then become a most serious injury to home colonisation and the restrictions so placed on the natural development of the soil by the heathfowl mania has had the effect of banishing many of the most worthy and patriotic sons of Caledonia to Canada Australia and the United States to seek homes in place of those denied to them in the land of their birtha land which had been fertilised with the blood of their ancestors poured out like funeral wine in its defence and which they too would have been so willing and able if necessary to protect with their claymores
So far from any one being able to speak a single word on behalf of the legislative cultivation or development of the heathfowl it ought to be condemned strongly as a cruel and heartless means of inflicting unnecessary pain and torture on the lower orders of creation
The Cockney who fires at the centre of a covey of grouse wounding a greater number than he can kill is much more deserving of fine or imprisonment than the Gilmerton carter who overworks his horse seeking to procure an income for the support of his family
As Lord Denrnan observed in the House of Lords when the Pigeon Shooting Penalties Bill was being discussed on the th August last that the said sport was less cruel than a grouse drive
It cannot be pleaded on behalf of this grovelling and unmanly occupation totally unworthy of the name of sport that like fox hunting in encourages brave and resolute action or invigorating exercise
There is literally no excitement in grouse slaughtering any more at least than there would be in firing into a flock of geese or other barndoor fowls
In shooting the tiger or in wounding a bear there is the excitement created by danger and the same feeling is raised in the breast of the lion hunter but the grouse devotee has nothing enlivening or exciting in his role any more than a butcher has in taking the life of an innocent bleating lamb just removed from its dam
Another objection to the development of heathfowl in the Highlands is the low degrading and demoralising manners it develops among young watchers and gamekeepers who as part of their profession endeavour to entrap their neighbours into breaches of the highly injurious legislation for the protection of game
These novitiates are educated to become suspicious lazy and quarrelsome and the only advantage they are to the State is the duty they pay to the revenue in the shape of whisky dutythat is when they cannot procure their favourite beverage from such a smuggling bothy as William Black describes as having been operated by big Murdoch near AultnamBa 
The encouragement given by Government to the growth of heather in the Highlands a plant all but worthless to man has another disadvantage by no means unworthy of attention
In the higher glens which are usually late in their harvests the grouse very frequently  pack on the stooks of the crofters and farmers and destroy not a little of the grain which they have been at so much pains to get brought to maturity in face of the steepness of the fields they have often to cultivate the severities of a fickle and tempestuous climate as well as from forcing their crops from a soil not usually very deep nor naturally fertile
From the special inducements held out by Government for the extension of sporting estates as they are called the prosperity of the population has been heavily handicapped as from the mountainous nature of the country the constituents of the rocksmostly Lawrentian in character the game law presses with unequalled severity upon the north country and so long as this arbitrary and iniquitous legislation is allowed to defile the statute book anything in the shape of remedial measures cannot fail to be of a disappointing description as  fixity of tenure  valuations for improvements c will have no meaning where the cultivators of the soil are forced to leave their straths and their glens to make room for the feathered denizens of the mountain and fell
Had the Highlander and his natural enemy been left alone to fight out their struggle for bare existence the landowners would have been forced as they certainly should be forthwith to spend their energies and invest their capital in the endeavour to obtain returns in a legitimate manner
They would have had to drain the mosses and to irrigate the bare ridges as the people in Switzerland have long done even under greater disadvantages
But for the highly injurious effect of the game law there could now be a million of sheep raised in the Highlands in addition to the number now maintained and besides there could certainly be more thau a million of acres uuder thriving plantations yielding timber to the value of  per acre and more south of the watershed after paying all the expenses of planting the seed making roads through the woods and building dykes for protecting the plants
Were the heather burned rich grasses like Poa alpina could be sown and doubtless some of the varieties recently discovered in the Himalayas and other foreign countries would  be found most suitable for transplantation to the Grampians
Landed proprietors should be compelled to turn their lands to account or suffer them to be operated upon by the State or by other hands
The English statute called interdict of waste could be most advantageously introduced  into the Highlands
Those having any doubt as to the suitableness of the Highlands for growing fine timber need only examine the natural woods of Strathspey Rannoch Braemav Murthly and Strathdulnan or Duthil to come to the conclusion that enterprise could do much to assist nature
Birch grows wild high on Benvenue Birnam and many other high hills so where it can be seen in a thriving condition timber of a more valuable description could be successfully grown
In fine what between arboriculture and sheep grazing the products of the Highlands could be reasonably expected to be increased two million pounds sterling in annual value while giving employment to a vast number of people all by the abolition of the game law or laws which are at present the source of much injustice and misery
With regard to deer forests at the commencement of the century there were only a few thousand acres under deer as no one was at liberty to have a forest chase or park without a charter from the Crown
Anciently there were courts specially constituted for the trial of persons offending against the forest laws and I knew one trespasser who was fined  for shooting a deer by the keeper of one of the royal forests Benachrombeg now forming a part of the Glen Tilt sporting ground
These forest laws have it is believed fallen into desuetude and their penalties could not now be enforced
Whether red deer are royal game now is a question regarding which there is a good deal of room for dispute and also whether there is any law in existence which could be applied for their protection
The right of unauthorised landowners erecting forests is also one which claims consideration as many lawyers are of opinion that the royal authority is still necessary for legalising the throwing of lands waste for this purpose
In ancient times even when moors were of little or no agricultural value there was a strong feeling against apportioning land for sporting purposes and the qualification for shooting all kinds was the ownership of a ploughgate of land whatever that meant
In other words the ownership of an estate gave no special privilege for sporting upon it
I knew a gentleman who in travelling from the south of England to Lochaber shot over all the ground where he could find game and he was only once challenged and then he was not put to any trouble
Our ancestors were very chary as to sanctioning the appropriation of lands or misappropriation rather for such useless purposes as deer shooting and the sooner public attention is drawn to the erection system the better as the land devoted to this purpose is wholly lost to the nation
Forests certainly do not more than repay the current outlays for wages to keepers and for feeding stuffs such as hay during winter
Their flesh is of no commercial value in our markets and the sole reason for the maintenance of these vast preserves is the gratification certain people receive from witnessing the destruction and death struggles of the antlered monarch of the glen
The same sort of pleasure could be obtained in any abbatoir at no cost to the highly refined observer while no loss would thereby be caused to the nation
The case was different formerly when stalking was in fashion and when the shooting of a stag say in Glen Tilt half a century ago was an event of considerable importance in the locality and when leading statesmen triumphed in such an achievement
In centuries gone by red deer were to be found straying all over Scotland  and so far as the Highlands are concerned even if the supposed legal protection were withdrawn there would still be found no inconsiderable number roaming over the mountain fastnesses yielding far more sport in their capture than is now enjoyed by the present socalled sportsmen of the Winans type
Indeed so cruel and wanton is the present mode of deerslaying that those engaged in it should be criminally prosecuted for cruelty to animals
The American millionaire is a typical deerslayer who pays some  per annum as rent for forests and while sitting in an easy chair he has droves of deer driven past him at which he fires off his rifle which has been loaded to his hand
Very well
In order to arrive at some idea of the national resources altogether wasted for the grovelling excitement of deer slaughtering reference may be made to the Black Mount forest belonging to Lord Breadalbane which covers over  acres
A census was taken some years ago of deer roaming over it and there were found to be  in all
Allowing six sheep for a deer this would show grazing for  sheep
In former times the sheep from this now unproductive region  topped  the market at Falkirk Tryst
Glen Tilt or what is now called the forest by that name was stated in evidence by the late proprietor socalled as covering  acres
It must be borne in mind however that only a small part of the glen has forest rights viz Benachrombeg and of which forest the Duke of Athole is but hereditary keeper
This lovely and fertile strath formerly maintained some  of a population but the people were evicted because they would not compel their youth to enlist in the Athole volunteers a fencible regiment designed for seven years service at home and to be thereafter disposed of to the East India Company by which corporation the regiment numbered the th was regularly purchased
Over and above the stock kept in Glen Tilt at present which is one of the most fertile pasturages in Britain a large stock of cattle and sheep could be fattened for markets in the south  the exact number it would be somewhat difficult to name but farmers in the north maintain that Glen Tilt could graze a stock of  sheep over and above its present number
Not a small part of the waste ground is well suited for plantation and owing to the fertility of the soil land so utilised would if judiciously managed yield from  to  per acre while under crop besides all expenses
Many of the forests are not so well suited for pasturage or plantation as Tiltside  but wherever deer can find subsistence the hardy blackfaced wedder can thrive and were windbreaks reared on suitable spots the grazing would be much more valuable
A great improvement could be introduced by the north country proprietors into their pastures by the erection of stells ie wooden shades for sheltering the sheep particularly ewes at lambing time and for storing hay and corn meal for feeding when pasture was not to be had owing to the depth of snow
Ensilage too would prove more beneficial in the Highlands than anywhere in Britain owing to the drenching rains washing the substance out of the coils of cut grass
The opening up of grouse and deer forest lands to the magical influences of capital enterprise and industry would not only extend a hundredfold whatever remains of commerce there may still be left in the north but an enormous addition would take place in the supply of wool and skins the graziers receiving large quantities of smearing materials per contra
Farmers in the lowlands of the counties of Perth Stirling and Forfar would benefit largely by an increased demand for winterings and the enterprising agriculturists of the Lothians could then depend upon obtaining supplies of wedders for fattening on their turnips of which at present there is a marked deficiency
Taking a moderate calculation probably the land now lying waste under deer could carry a stock of  sheepincluding equivalents as cattle ponies c this would yield an outcome of say  sheep which would form no inconsiderable addition to our food supplies
Then again their skins would be worth say s d each which would extend the trade of skinneries in Edinburgh and other places
Altogether the loss which is now suffered by the country by deer might be safely enough set down at  per annum
Although this may not appear a great find or gain to the nation at large the abolition of the legal protection to deer forests in the north would entirely revolutionise the Highlands and that in a very few years
Large tracts of moorland now lying utterly desolate would soon be waving with a rich foliage and other wilds would again become resonant with the bleating of sheep
I come now to the law of primogeniture and entail in regard to which my sentiments are exactly in accord with those of your Lordship as stated before the Social Science Congress in
The Sinclair estates  acres the Menzies estates  acres  the Ramsden estates  acres Huntly estates  acres Glengarry Ellice estates  acres Lochiel estates acres Chisholm estates  acres Evan Bailies estates  acres Gordon Cluny estates  acres Invercauld estates  acres Lovat estates  acres Macdonald Lord estates  acres MIntosh estates  acres MLeod estates  acres Gairloch estates  acres Poltallochestates  acres Matheson MP estates  acres Matheson trustees estates  acres  Richmond and Gordon estates  acres Seafield estates  acres Balnagowan estates  acres Argyll estates  acres Athole estates  acres Fife estates  acres Sutherland estates  acres
There is no grouse ground that I know of in all the Highlands from which stock is excluded entirely
I do not know of any grouse moor in the Highlands where a contrary law operates in other words I do not know of any grouse moor but would be immensely increased in production but for the rearing of grouse
Not exactly shooting but deer forest
There is none that I know
Yes
Upwards of  acres
I have obtained statistics showing that there were  deer counted and I take six sheep for one deer though some would make it seven and on that calculation and from information I have received from graziers in that part I believe the Blackmount would carry a stock of  sheep and I may tell you further that there are various farms there which are calculated to produce the finest blackfaced mutton in the Highlands
That is so
Glen Tilt I have calculated on the same basis
Farr Bettyhill th October 
I have
For many years
Yes I have a large correspondence with my fellowcountrymen in the colonies
Most certainly
No they coincide with every word I said
The sentiments I expressed are from letters I received from the colonies
Yes Mr Purves made that statement
Yes I have heard that
I did not hear about five years
Certainly
No and he included the education rate so as to make it appear worse
Well that is the worst of it
They send their children away and the money that ought to be spent in the country is spent elsewhere
No
Yes
In Scotland there are four and twenty thousand Mackays and only nine thousand Sutherlands
Yes ever since I remember
Yes
I had a good occasion to test that in  when in conjunction with others I was called upon to get the clansmen to subscribe for a testimonial to Charles Mackay the poet and I succeeded  astonishingly
I think I handed over about 
I should like to see it
I believe I will but I regard the Duke of Sutherland as being as much my chief as Lord Reay
If my father was a Mackay a Sutherland was my mother and I daresay if the truth were known I had a greater love for my mother than I had for my father
Yes that was acquired in  when they inveigled Strathnaver from the first Lord Reay
Plenty sheep
Yes I heard so  and I heard other evidence in the statement submitted to you by Mr Purves that with regard to the small crofts which the Duke of Sutherland had at Shiness the crofters all left them
That is really a deliberate falsehood
I will
That is what I mean
I would and I have been trying for the last three or four years in my own humble way to impress upon his Grace the necessity for it
I believe that is what he wishes but for some years hitherto he has not given that attention to the condition of the crofters that the proprietor of so large an estate is bound to do
He has left too much to the factors
I believe myself that the Duke of Sutherland is most benevolently inclined but being benevolently inclined why does he not take any action
It was said and it was hoped most sincerely in  and  when he began those reclamations about Shiness that he was going to take some of the congested population away and plant them at Shiness but when they saw that those  acres there were divided into  acre lots their hopes fell at once
Astonishingly
It has been said that Sellar alone in two leases of thirtyeight years left the county with  and he must have done so
Well after he left Sutherland he bought great estates
That is true
Yes and more intense now than when I was a boy
I never heard of  particularly but if there was such it was not peculiar to Sutherland
It touched the whole country and Sutherland was not any worse off than the people in other counties
Very much
I have read the statistical accounts in the Scottish Gazetteer to ascertain what was the state of the population in other counties and I find that in Morayshire the state of society was almost intolerable much worse than in Sutherland
I read again about Banffshire Aberdeenshire and Forfarshire and really in Morayshire in  they were in a more rude state than the population of Sutherland
Yes
As well as I can make out from the accounts I read in gazetteers it was the same
I dont think so
I dont think so
Because the people who suffered worst farmed too near down the river side and mildews would be frequent and spoilt the crops
But in Strathnaver now you would find that the crofters with their present knowledge would cultivate the flanks and leave the river side for grazing
They would be higher up and protected from mildew which only rises a certain distance above the water
No doubt of it
They were driven to the hills
Well that was almost a matter of necessity
There was more labour given to the people and the old race were sent halfway up the hill side
I dont think the Highlanders have come to such a pass as to ask the Government to help them
I know that
I am talking of Sutherland and part of Ross
I know that on the seacoast the inhabitants are in a worse state that in the inland places
Take the parish of Rogart which naturally was so sterile that it did not attract the eye of the sheep farmers hundreds of the people were huddled upon it but by their own industry there is as good agriculture to be seen in the parish of Rogart as you will see in Rossshire on the large farms
if the landlords were unwilling to helpthe Government might give a certain amount of help but not much
Well that is the idea that has got hold of the people
I think something of the sort might be done
That would depend on the nature of the soil and the locality
If there was a croft near a town it would be more valuable than a croft at a distance
I think if rents were to be fixed by law the large farms ought to be valued just the same as the small farms
I think that ought to be done
The present discontent 
He is very much better able to take care of himself than the small crofter is  and now when the Agricultural Holdings Act has been obtained for Scotland I dont think the large farmer requires any further protection because he makes his rent for himself by offering so much for a farm and it is his own fault if he gives too much
I think not
The labourer is engaged or hired for the year
If he is dissatisfied he can take himself off at the end of that year
No  the crofter has his stock
True but the farm labourer has no interest at all in the soil
All the interest he has in doing his duty is to get the wages agreed upon but the crofter may have improved his croft and would be unwilling to leave it
My own personal opinion is give them compensation for improvements and they will secure fixity of tenure
I dont think it is possible that evictionswilful evictionswill or can take place in the Highlands in the future
Public opinion is too strong
Yes I have been to see them four or five times and I did not give a very favourable impression of them to his Grace
I asked how much these were costing per acre
He told me
I asked him how much rent he expected to get for it
He told me
I said  My lord Duke that will not be  per cent upon the outlay
What was his reply
The reply was this  Oh we in this country are not like you Englishmen looking out for dividends
I am not acquainted with the intentions
I dont think so
If that was the primary intention it was very soon abandoned but I think the real intention was to provide winterings
The sheep men were complaining that they had not sufficient wintering for their sheep
The had previously to that raised his sheep rents very much and when the Duke sheep farmers began to complain of the very high rents he took this means of giving them wintering at hand
Some were sending their sheep to Rossshire to winter at very great expense then it was thought he would get wintering for the sheep farmers at home which would be very much better
Practically and financially it is a disaster
I believe if it had been trenched in the way I have seen Highland land reclaimed trenching from  to  inches deep by the pick and the spade it would have been done at a cheaper rate a very much cheaper rate
There is not so much land now in the occupation of crofters in the parish of Rogart that can be reclaimed
I believe they have reclaimed almost all that they can within their own reclamation bounds
Reclamation by crofters themselves without any aid from Dunrobin goes on and has gone on in the parish of Rogart for the last twenty years I may say at the rate of between  and  a year and that the crofters added to the value of the estate
The results have been satisfactory certainly because I recollect some of that land as worthless not producing d per acre
They have drained it and fenced it and now it is producing excellent crops especially turnips
There are as good turnips produced by the crofters of Rogart as by the large farmers in Rossshire and better
I never was in the Isle of Skye and can hardly say
I should say the Isle of Skye was moister and milder
No
I never was there but it is an island I should like to visit
It is an island for which I have the highest regard
Skyemen as soldiers are A
No
All tenants at will
I have no knowledge of rent being raised during a lifetime but on the son succeeding the father there have been great rises as much as from  s d to   all at once
Yes and loses the value of the industry of his father
I have known men in Rogart work with such assiduity and taking little care of themselves working in wet and so onthat they shortened their days very much
My own father was an instance of that
He began those improvements in Rogart I believe and I have now his lot and I am going on the same as my father did reclaiming an acre every year
I dont think so
I made this proposition to the Duke of Sutherland  If you will give me my fathers place I will spend  upon it if you will give me a long lease
He said  What do you mean by a long lease
 Thirtyeight years I said
 I cannot give you that he said
I said  Very well I will not spend the 
I dont think that leases would benefit the people of Sutherland a whit
Although their rents may be raised according to what was stated by a deathrate I dont think there was really any great oppression about it
Under the Duke of Sutherland the crofters are not except perhaps in some circumstances too highly rented
The average rent of the two hundred crofters of Rogart is  s d
That is the average
Some pay  On the average they have about seven and a half acres with hill ground and every croft in Rogart has  acres of arable and hill pasture
The two hundred crofters occupy  acres which gives  acres to each crofter
The most of that is hill ground which is not very valuable
I dont think so
In saying so I simply express my own opinion and the opinion of the people
Better let them be as they are without leases than with
No no I would have compensation for improvements
That I think is the greatest grievance
I would say that supposing they are as they are without leases if at the end of a fathers life the son succeeded regular returns of improvements every year should be kept and then it would be seen whether the tenant had received a return for the improvements he had made during his occupancy
That is to say supposing there were twentyone years divided into three parts of seven years each I should say the improvements made during the first seven years might be considered as not entitled to any compensation
On the improvements made in the second period of seven years I think the occupant if he left at the end of twentyone years ought to have onethird of the cost and then for the improvements made in the third period he ought to get twothirds of the value of the improvements
Quite so
Yes
No
Quite so
Entirely
Yes
Perfectly accurate and I have a perfect recollection of it myself
A more quiet more submissive more lawabiding people there were not from Lands End to John o Groats
There were no policemen in the county in my boyhood and they were not required
There was not a lock upon a house and it was not required
Clothes put out to bleach were as sure as possible to be found in the morning
The people morally are the same now as then and what they were fashioned into in the days of old they can be fashioned into in the time to come
Twentythree thousand
I should say 
The average rental in the parish of Farr is  s
 Tongue  s
 Durness  s d and before I went to see them I thought they must be well off paying so small a rent but when I beheld the miserable plots of land on which they were perched I said it would be much better for the Duke of Sutherland to get the  Great Eastern  and take those people off and send them to America
I could hardly do that just now
Very few
There are only three large farms in the parish of Rogart and they are very extensive
No
Certainly and not only socially but I look at it from a higher point of viewI look at it nationally
I see nothing to prevent it
The only difficulty I see is that leases cannot be broken without compensation  but if a desire were manifested that such a thing should be done and if a real attempt were made to reverse the policy of the past we would all hail it with the greatest delight and not only so but we would contribute to help the people on
I for one would and all my brothers would
Just so
The people of Sutherland are in a most deplorable condition all on the same level
The wonder is that they are so submissive and orderly
They govern themselves
They have no governors
They have the advice of their ministers certainly
Oh dear no
There was an excellent order of society before this sheep farming mania began
There was the chief and he was always at home
He was surrounded by members of his family chieftains and tacksmen and these were men of knowledge and intelligence
Many of them had been in the army and many of them even had been in the Dutch army and had returned with a great deal of knowledge of the world
If such a year were to happen now the effect would be simply deplorable
Certainly only there is this difference now that there is better communication and assistance from without would come but supposing there was no communication now in Sutherland or that the communication was the same as at the beginning of the century I believe half the population would be starved out
They had great resources in the past
They had immense flocks of cattle horses sheep and goats
They kept as many sheep as provided them with food and clothing
The poor rates show that and not only so but the people now are not so kindly disposed towards each other as they were in the past
Yes
Yes in a graduated state
Why it is the misfortune of the Duke of Sutherland that he has not a gentleman of his own blood surrounding him in Sutherland
All are strangersa serious matter to the county
The population of Strathnaver was always reckoned at about  and for the oldest of those Fencible regiments I mentioned it could turn out  men at any time the finest men in Sutherland and noted to be so
I should say so
The returns I gave would show  but you will find the names of places there where the people were so honest that they would not put any fictitious numbers down
So if you take the names of places without any number of families attached and add a number for each township you will find there were in Strathnaver from one end of it to the other  families
As near the truth as can be ascertained now
I see no reason why that should not be and I see a reason that it should be so and that some expenditure should not be grudged so as to retrieve the past
If the natives of Sutherland who supported the dignity of the house of Sutherland were so cavalierly treated in the past surely the Duke of Sutherland ought now to make amends for it
Oh dear no 
not half the money
Not only hail it with great joy but would assist
He could not read
Yes
That is so
No but such was then the feeling with the chiefs and tacksmentheir intercourse was so familiar that they educated one another
The only secular bard of the time of whom we have any knowledge as educated was Alexander Macdonald
Yes I thought that was the shortest way and the way also to prevent looseness of language
But before doing so I wish to make an explanation first how it was that I who am neither a crofter nor the son of a crofter nor a landlord nor the son of a landlord happen to take an interest in this matter
About thirtyfive years ago I stayed in Braemar and wandering about the many glens there I saw an immense number of ruined cottages a perfect desolation
Being a person of some human sympathy I dropt a few tears over that desolation and wrote a few sonnets and poems which I called Braemar Ballade
A gentleman whom I met at the time said to me Blackie poetry is of no use  but I have a connection with the Times newspaper and if you write a letter to the Times I will get an article to back it up
 Oh oh said I and I wrote a letter and an article in the Times came down to back it
Then there was a row and for six weeks afterwards my whole breakfast table was deluged with papers about the desolation in the Highlands
Yes I am merely making an explanation how I took up the matter at all
But I cannot adopt an artificial manner
I was merely going to say that I thought on account of this deluge of letters upon my poor head there must be something rotten in the state of the Highlands
I shall first state the facts of the case as I have learned them by pedestrianising over the Highlands for thirty years and more and also the political social and economical aspects of the case as they appear to me and secondly I shall state the remedies which appear to me to be appropriate and necessary
Yes
Well I think I have indicated that
I name another Commission because I do not think that under the present law anything can be done
We have what I call the right of the rich to override the poor and the  strong to override the weak but if that Commission were to report they would say Here is a district in the possession of a south country farmer from which the population has been excluded
We ordain by the power of Parliament that the proprietor shall distribute that among a certain number of native farmers
According to circumstances
I believe in the terms of a letter written to me by the Duke of Argyll many years ago that a proper mixture of large small and medium farms according to circumstances is a wise custom
I know he would not
He is a landlord and I am not
Here is a piece of land that might be advantageously subdivided for the accommodation of the inhabitants and it would be for your pecuniary advantage that it should be subdivided
Most distinctly
Most distinctly
No man is entitled to desert the post where God has put him
If he makes money out of it let him live there
No
There are parts of the Highlands which naturally and always were deer forests
The greatest Highland poet Duncan Ban was a gamekeeper and an excellent deer stalker
But I would have a survey made to see how much land had been encroached upon that was not naturally deer forest
That is one element of course
The principle would be based on exact knowledge and observation and survey of the spot and seeing from the nature of the ground and the nature of the soil what the country was worth and must be worth for ever and also historically what part of that land now occupied as deer forests contains good grass and good soil which had been occupied and could be occupied by crofters for pasture and for tillage
It could be done by survey by scientific menagricultural men
Most distinctly
Let them know they are the enemies of the native population and pay for it
Why it is a general fama in the Highlands 
I did not personally take notice of instances but I am sure Highlanders would be able to tell you
It is a fama
For instance I remember when I was passing through Rossshire not long ago I saw what was originally a large sheep farm but the sheep farm did not pay and now it has become a deer forest
Of course the people were not kicked off but the system made them go away
Because the deer forest comes to supply the big farmers place very often
In many cases the farmers have told me that the deer came into their ground and ale their oats and turnips and they had no remedy
One old woman told me when I asked her why she did not complain They gave me a good hint that if I complained they would turn me off tomorrow
That there have been formal evictions I do not know
You will know much better than I do because you have been taking the evidence
I have not read it though I mean to do so when it is published
I dont know that there have been recent evictions but that the deer forests have been encroaching upon land that originally and not long ago belonged to the people I know
As I say it is a fama
A fama does not arise out of nothing
I did not take notice of the special cases
What I took notice of was that once a sheep farm occupied a whole glen and now it is all let as deer forest
I do not say there was formal legal eviction
Well that would be simply for this reason as I said before that the men were removed to make way for the sheep and the sheep were removed to make way for the deer
Yes if Lowlanders hold the glens with their sheep I would tell the Lowlanders to be offafter a certain number of years the lease shall terminate and it shall be divided amongst native Highlanders if they choose to take it
If they do not let the Lothian farmer come back
I want to give the land back to the people who held it if it can be done and I do not see why it should not
If the big farmers were not to have their leases renewed and the Government were to say this land shall be divided among crofters I dont see any harm in that
I believe not
It would be deficient as applied to the Highlands
I think the Irish Land Act would apply to Scotland with modifications and qualifications of very great consequence
I speak of the great lines of it
No no
I looked thoroughly into that subject when recently in Ireland and I think it is very likely that the Irish Land Act while applying beneficially to what I call farmers of substance and farms of a certain size would not apply at all or not act well or might perpetuate the evil when applied to such a very degraded and almost lost population as you find in some of the worst parts of the Highlands
were to be applied to Scotland they might not apply to all parts equally or to all the Highlands equally
They might depend a good deal upon some previous regulations made with regard to size and subdivision of farms
I certainly hold that subdivision of a farm ought not to be allowed
Before these principles were applied to the Highlands there ought to be a distinct report about the variety of tenures in different parts of the Highlands and they might be applied with extensive reservation
Certainly always where there is common sense there are reservations and modifications
You talk the most perfect good sense and it is my own opinion
I am perfectly aware of that
But laws are not made for good proprietors but for bad proprietors
If all landlords were as reasonable as that nothing would require to be done but I dont think it is right and proper to allow freedom of contract in every case to allow those who are strong in position and money to have the poor people at their mercy through the accident of a man being a good man
I would make all these things liable to certain land regulations with certain rates to be fixed by commissioners
That might be called Prussian and Bismarckian
Well I wish we had a little of Prussia and Bismarck here
I would not allow the common people to be at the mercy even of good landlords because the majority of them may be bad
That is quite possible  I admit that
Well but dont you see the people would be able to use it for good purposes because they would get their land at a less rent and they would do for the land what they could not have done otherwise
But that is quite possible
I have heard people saying in Ireland that because they had not absolute power any more and could not get as much rent as they had been getting they would go away and invest their money in England or America
Well if the landlords choose to desert their post for the loss of  or  let them do so but I still say it is not a safe thing to intrust the landlords with the fixing of the rent in the general case
I am perfectly sure that some peoples rage for land with plenty of money would make them buy up whole counties
Still I provide for that by laws of succession  create distribution by succession
It could not be worse than it now is
Every evil has an incidental good it is quite true
That is what I call distribution
That kind of migration
Yes of course there has been but I mean migration to uninhabited parts
It must do so
No human being could be brought up in such good circumstances as the Highlander on the bens and the bracken and the braes
It is impossible for  with its whole sanitary appliances to make such a man as is made on the Highland hills
It cannot be
Which were originally occupied by them and are now occupied by the big farmers
Yes and quite right so far but it should not have been encouraged so much
It was overdone because they got no encouragement at home
Certainly it was
The laird was of less importance himself
Yes I am aware of that
I think it must have been so but I dont know it as a fact
I am not aware of that historically
My knowledge relates more to the existing factors
I did not study that point historically
I dont think I can answer you many questions of curious minute history on these matters
 cannot tell you
I understood always the first eviction or as I would say emigration was voluntary
In the first emigration the Glengarry people deserted their homes because they would not live in such a countrybecause they had lost all their dignity and honour but I dont know when the first eviction was
I think the first was Glen Dessary but it is very difficult to get information about these old evictions
No I cannot say that of my own knowledge
Yes
Well I am a bit of a lawyer and I think I have heard of that
I have always understood that the whole Scotch law was most severe and monstrous and inhuman just as in the case you mention
I never inquired particularly but it is a well known fact to students of law that people were hanged for sheep stealing
Of course it was not the man they cared for but the sheep
I have no doubt many of the legal gentlemen with wigs now before you will be able to explain all about that better than I can
It is quite notorious they used all kinds of language on the bench in those days  they were sometimes more than half drunk
Quite impossible
It could not be
What I know of Glen Dessary is from Principal Shairp of St Andrews who wrote a poem on Glen Dessary and he always represented it to me as a violent eviction but I could get no documents and he had no documents to give me though he wrote the poem
Poets can do without documents sometimes
He was extremely fervid against the cruelty of that eviction and he referred me to the son of au old shepherd that he had spoken to but I could not get hold of him so I know nothing about Glen Dessary
If I could have got real knowledge about Glen Dessary or any others I would not have brought forward so prominently as I did the Strathnaver business because I dont wish to injure the feelings of a respected colleague and I could not get any other about which there was written evidence to bring forward
I have walked over whole tracts of desolate country
I remember in Mull walking over such a tract with a landed proprietor who was one of the bestand the best are always those that speak Gaelic
We were passing through an old ruin of perfect desolation and he said I thank Heaven that I have not to think of that desolation on my deathbed
I think it was most unwise to send away the people in that way for the sake of making money by sheep farming with no consideration for their consuetudinary rights as holders of the soil
Yes undoubtedly
It is possible men are becoming more reasonable
I remember a factor in Sutherland told me they had overdone the large farms and that they would have to subdivide them and I was told by a gentleman in Ireland whose father or some other relation had made immensely large farms that he thought it had been overdone
I presume therefore they are beginning to come to reason and besides the voice of humanity is a little more strong in the present generation
The good landlord would think it too hard
No man likes to lose power
I know some of the best landlords in Ireland who are violently against Gladstones law and therefore I say the good landlord would object
No man likes to lose power
It is a pleasing thing
I said before that a landlord ought not to be intrusted with fixing the rent or making a bargain with poor tenants
I think so
There is a want of a middle class over the whole Highlands through the mismanagement of a hundred years
There is a want of a middle class
There is no society
Certainly  and there ought to be a wise system of emigration established under Government supervision and there should be a fund of which part should be paid by the Government and part by proprietors in the neighbourhood who are relieved by it
Yes certainly
Whenever emigration takes place you should take care and make proper laws against subdivision against large farms and to prevent too small subdivision occurring again
There ought to be laws to prevent these extremes and the Government should insist upon landholders dividing their land in a rational way
I am sure that often the landlords did not know what was done at all
It was done by factors probably to please themselves and their friends and to save themselves trouble
I know quite well it was to save themselves trouble
Quite simply
The sheriff in Scotland is a man that can be trusted with anything but not alone the sheriff with two valuators one appointed by the landlord and the other by the tenant and that would practically be the same as the present land courts now sitting in Ireland only much cheaper and much better
In an Irish land court I visited in Kenmare the president was a lawyer not a sheriff and the other two were valuators
I think the thing could be done perfectly simply only the principle of rent altogether even as applying to large farms might require revision if we had a new and philosophical kind of  legislation
But I see practically speaking no difficulty
It would be quite cheap
 or  in addition to the sheriffs income would not be objectionable
Who accused me
There is a certain class of people in this world who if you give them a thing with the right hand are sure to take it with the left
They will misunderstand and misapply and distort what I say
It is the habitual practice of the newspapers to do so
If you dont happen to belong to their party they make a business of distorting and abusing everything you say
It is their business
They are just drunk with the wine of faction
My own conscience is perfectly free
I never told anybody not to pay rent
I never told anybody to shoot landlords from behind a hedge what I have stated is that it was a strange thing that the Irish who were guilty of such things should get lollypops while the quiet Highlanders got stripes and nothing else
No statement I have some notes I intend to lay before the Commission in connection with the evidence which has been given in regard to the Tongue district especially in connection with the state of the crofters there and the evictions that took place in
Harbour accommodation
My statement upon harbourage is based upon the present condition of the crofters in Tongue factorage
When the evictions took place it was held out to them as a reason why they should be evicted that the only industry within their reach was the wealth that belonged to the ocean
But after they were sent there no steps were taken to further their interest in that respect no proper harbourage was provided they were left to take their places in little creeks or distant bays on exposed parts of the coast and ever since  downwards to the present day although the Duke of Sutherland has  miles of seashore on his estate there is not one single harbour for the benefit of the fishermen
There are several places where a fishing population is now located and where if a harbour were built a special industry would grow up in the county which would have a beneficial effect in changing the present system which prevails in the county and might be the means of breaking down the exclusiveness which borders round about the crofters in their little districts
Take the district of Port Skerra where there has been a fishing population since the evictions took place
The rent first was only  s d and Melvich  s and they themselves have increased their holdings in value to  Altogether the capitalised value of what the crofters have done for the benefit of his Grace is  being the capitalised value of the crofts which they have made by their own labour
That has cost his Grace nothing and yet there is nothing done for the people in the way of providing for the only industry which is within their reach
I also find that because this industry is lacking to them they have to get s d of every pound they spend in the county outside the county
Their rental is  Each croft is supposed to bear three rents
Taking two of them for their support and adding to that the amount of money his Grace is said to have expended among them yearly for the last  twenty years makes  Adding to that  as the value of their regular fishings brings out about  Then adding to that any other sum they are able to get out of the neighbourhoodlocal labour from those who are able to employ them I find that comes to about  In this fishing locality there are  families and those  families cost each year  so that foursevenths of what is required for their support is got within the county and threesevenths must be got outside
That argues that the locality does not support the population and something must be done in order that their support will be by the earth again
I know nothing that will bring that about so readily as harbourage and I think some means might be taken to secure harbours for the three principal places on the Tongue coast
Port Skerra Armadale and Skerray  or leaving out Armadale which is a small place take Palmin where an excellent deep sea harbour might readily be built
These remarks I venture to lay before the Commission in connection with the special matter of harbourage because they show that if his Grace were prevailed upon to halve the population to make a distinct fishing population and a distinct farming populationthat would be the best possible means of opening up the resources of the county and bringing back the state of matters to what it used to be when in the days of the tacksmen there was a graded population from the chief downwards
The men who were known as tacksmen in those days were men of culture and men of some refinement which linked society together in such a way that confidence was preserved amongst them
But now the population of Sutherlandshire find themselves all together along the seacoast
There is nothing permanent for their industry or work  they are dependent upon outside labour and resources for their support while they ostensibly pay rent for their little crofts to his Grace
There were some other matters which I thought it might be desirable to bring before the Commission in connection with evictions but as the hour is late I will beg leave to hand in a statement on that point
Quite distinct if there were harbours
Already his Grace has tried that in a small way at Port Skerra
He built four or five cottages there some fifteen or twenty years ago and they have never lacked tenants though they have no land
Not even for a garden in this case I specially refer to
Personally I should like them to have half an acre or an acre for garden ground attached to their little cottages
Not for pasture or special agricultural purposes
Personally I think it would be a hindrance and encumbrance to them in prosecuting their calling
Having a right to look upon their holdings as their own
I can adduce a case in Berwickshire at Burnmouth where the people have secured a harbour for themselves
The fishing population there numbering  spent  on a harbour and last year the white fishing amounted to  and the greater part of the fishermen hold their houses as feuars
At this place no area  the houses are as near as possible to highwater mark beneath the brae or cliff
They have not
They are prevented from that
That could be restricted
I dont see there would be any danger if the houses were built on ground properly feued and arranged
Not if the feuar has the right but feus could be granted without that right
Only in such circumstances
If a harbour were provided for them I have no hesitation in saying their own industry and thrift would speedily provide that for them
In the past that has been the case to some extent
This little village I spoke of had twenty years ago twenty herring boats as they are called manned by five men and a boy each but the fishing has declined since then and there are only ten there now
Never
In the north we have been accustomed to look upon the fishcurers as interested in such advances and as being willing to make them if the fishing were promising and favourable
None whatever
Just so
Yes
Larger crofts not renting less than  however much above
If liberty were given to have land on lease and that that might grow as the natural outcome of the progress of the country in consequence
The adjoining village of Ross is included in this enumeration of the increase of the fishing industry I have no doubt even in Sutherland in the course of nineteen years that would very materially show itself
That is the main thing and the natural prosperity of the people would lead up to it
No I desiderate that much
I desiderate it
I think the crofters have made a great mistake in speaking so much about Government aid
I think it would be a mistake
I look upon the fishing industry upon the north and west coast of Sutherland as the great hope of the country fishermen might acquire such a competency as would enable them to take to farming or the natural outcome of the country that would result from such townships
Possibly there are cases round about the Scotch coast where there is that seen
Not the fishing period but their own lifetime of fishing
Fiftyfive
That depends on the money he has on hand
He might
I believe he can
I am
I lived there from  till I finished my college course and came to settle in the south
Yes
Yes Burnmouth
Yes
I am not in a position to answer that question
They are distinct from the west coast fishermen
From the Highlanders
The Sutherland Highlanders who are now fishermen are the descendants of those who originally inhabited the straths of the country
They would if they had secure harbours
I know several at our own little village at home there are several families in it who are fishermen and have no land they have no other means of livelihood within their reach except fishing
So far as the weather permits
They go to the east coast during the herring fishing and when they come back they go to the white fishing and in spring they take to the lobster fishing
So far as the weather permits
I hope they do
But they are very much impeded in their labours by the lack of harbour accommodation which necessitates their dragging up their boats and by the risk from the surf in launching them again
All that might be prevented if they had deep sea basins
These are arms of the sealochs
Not that I am aware of  I have the orignal in my possession now
This is an exact copy
Mr Mackenzies reply is dated March  and is as follows
That seems so from the letter but there are one or two very interesting facts in itfirst that the holdings were large and second that it was only the exceptional year of scarcity  that caused the change  Mr Mackenzie says the unprecedented disaster of the former year
Quite in Sutherland
I am assured he never changed them
I enjoyed the privilege of his acquaintance until his death and have conversed with him on the subject of the clearances
Often with regret
He often lived in my fathers house and I have spent long nights with him talking over old days
Then in answer to that I can assert the knowledge of Mr Mackenzies own familythe members of his own family and they express what I have personal knowledge of that he never changed his mind from the statements and sentiments written to Mr Loch in
These were rather too sad and sorrowful times and the remembrance of them was too bitter for him to regret the opinion he formed in
About  or
Perfectly and discharged his parish duties to the very last without assistance
He was  but he was engaged before Ms settlement in Farr in doing work in the heights of the Strath
Often
That they were a happy contented peasantry and he always spoke of the tacksmen as educated gentlemen who were able to write out their own deeds as the charter chest in Dunrobin Castle proves
A century ago the tacksmen were able to sign their own names and adhibit their own signatures
No he never gave expression to such an opinion
Yes  that is the second clearance
No  Mr Mackenzie expressly says that all the seacoast except Strathy Point and parts of Armadale were thoroughly peopled
It is the best written evidence I have seen and in addition from my conversation with the people who were evicted out of the glen I know that the population must have been large
That is only a section that is from Achnabourin up to the Skail farm on the right hand side going up the Strath
Yes
All his conversation
From his daughter Mrs Macdonald who resides in Edinburgh
Yes he was the Free Church minister all along he went out
When I spoke of being in the parish I meant that I lived in Strathy and he had charge of the district and was our minister virtually
Yes
The west side the Skail farm
Only from Skelpick  from Rhifail further up on the east side there is very little green
They did and all who knew about it
They did
Possibly
I did not know Mr Mackenzie the catechist and I dont know if Mr Purves knew him
One in Langdale one in Achool another in Klibreck and another in Modal
From the upper end firstKilbreck and Mudal and the people went to Orkney and they were the progenitors of the Mackays of Orkney
The Mackays in Orkney are all Sutherland men who were evicted during the time of the clearances
Yes and today the Strath is held by three sheep farmers and the Tongue factorage by eleven people and only eleven families holding the land
Yes
I mind of my fathers house being burned and four houses that were in the place at the same time
It was not written by me but I stated the whole of it
No by my son it was dictated by me
Yes
Permit me to say that so far as I am concerned I am quite a disinterested man
But I recollect of the peasantry of these straths seeing them in my fathers house in my younger days and comfortable and very respectable men they were
I recollect of that perfectly
He had a little farm but it was diminished when the flitting took placewhen the removals took place
My father was one of four who had perhaps twenty or so acresthree more along with him and when the evictions took placewhen the allotments took placemy fathers farm was reduced to four acres or so amongst those who were removed from the heights of the parish
I believe it was in my time it took place
I recollect perfectly for the last seventy years and a more comfortable peasantry I never saw
The Established Church
Clyne
I do
Remarkably welldressed and stout
The Sutherland Fencibles were raised from themas fine a corps as ever entered the British army
About thirty years ago
I was at home until about  Then I entered the revenue service and was in Ireland for some years
I have been in different parts of Scotland and Ireland
We have
They are
As far as I can mind it would be the year  or  It was the last of the Sutherland burnings
No but I have mind after they were all put to the coast that the tenants out of the strath were placed in amongst the old tenants and they had  no means to live
Some of the land they had was invaded by the new tenants and I mind of the Duke of Sutherland sending them help
I never mind but of that year and it was after Strathnaver was cleared
Scarcely some of them
But they would depend upon cattle altogether
I mind one man came to the neighbourhood where I was and he had twentyone head of black cattle forby six horses and sheep I cannot tell what number of sheep
These came from Garvealt
That year I am speaking about
The year they were badly off
Nothing that I heard of I never heard
They did
They boiled it and took it with milk  after it cooled you could cut it like leather
No no I never heard that
I never knew of them bleeding the cattle till that year and I saw it done myself then
No other time
The year
Yes he was he took a great interest in the estate and in all public matters
Not on Millbuy at Knockbain and Drumsmittal but hardly with his consent his consent was never asked though he acquiesced
I have always understood there was a considerable removal in the early part of the century
It lies almost entirely that part we are now speaking of in Knockbain and Killearnan
I should apprehend there was  but I have not looked at the official returns
Killearnan
Much less distress than their remaining where they were in those cases under my knowledge
If you combine Mr Lindsays management with mine it has been
I have given you the figures it has been very considerable
Oh dear no
The area of cultivated land occupied by crofters may have doubled  in  it was  acres and in   acres
Very considerable
It has
They have with a third elementoutlay by the proprietor
The total sum expended since  on the crofter class of possessions has been about  including the value of manufactured timber supplied from the estate
I trust there has been
I think the only management for such an estate was materially to reduce a starving population
I have less doubt about the people than about the estate almost because the people who were starving in Kilcoy found employment elsewhere and are earning wages
Yes
Certainly no expenditure of the nature of improvement can be undertaken by me unless it has practically the double sanction of the Enclosure Commissioners as improvements which ought to be  made and of  the Accountant of Court as improvements which are judicious
No it would have been ultra vires
Since
I hope it will for Mr Mackenzies sake
I dont doubt
I dont think in this case they have but they have suffered very much necessarily from the absence of that kindly considerate treatment and intercourse which a landlord in full possession of his estate would no doubt have been able to bestow
But in the stricter view in which you are now looking at the matter of improvements and outlay on the estate I think as much has been done as any judicious proprietor would have done
I have not but with this qualification that I think the time may come and probably has come when what Mr Beattie suggested will be the proper management
The keeping up of a very large number of small houses on these lands is a burden upon somebody it is a heavy burden upon the tenants when they begin to get old as they will be in another nineteen years and it is an intolerable burden upon the landlord who derives such small rents comparatively from the land
Therefore the problem is not solved in my opinion it is only deferred
I have for many years
I read a paper before the Royal Society this spring which I was asked to print privately and of which I took the liberty to send you a copy
Certainly the result of my reading upon the subject has been to convince me that the idea that the predecessors of the present crofters had any real rights in the soil is contradicted by all the evidence of history
Certain of the occupants had certain rights
I should say from my reading that was a mistake
I apprehend that the fact is that the land any rights in the land which grew out of the growth of society were unquestionably vested in the sept or clan or tribe or whatever may have been its designation and that these were rather usurped by the king than  made over to him
I think not I think it was widely different from that the kings rights in his lands were very clearly defined
He had his own right as a member of the tribe and he had in addition to that his right as king to lands which were the kingly lands devoted to his maintenance as king and which the king at the time took  and there was sometimes a subking with lands devoted to him
It was a most elaborate system
But it is a mistake to say that the king held the whole of the property that the rest of the clan held of him
On the contrary he held in his own right as an individual and held also for the endurance of his office what was dedicated by the tribe for the maintenance of their sovereign
But you are making a tremendous leap  that is away many hundred years from the time I was speaking of
I was referring to the period prior to the breaking up of Scotland into the seven original earldoms I was looking at the time when the tribe first began to emerge from barbarism into civilisation and to cultivate the lands it had formerly merely wandered over as savages
During that time my reading has led me to form a clear conclusion that the right to the land was vested in the tribe that the kingly lands were set aside for the king the priestly lands for the priest the pipers lands for the piper and so on through an indefinite gradation and that thus they were held when the feudal system burst in upon them
Certainly as the foundation of the feudal system the king on paper made himself the lord of the manor of the whole of Scotland
You are perfectly right about that point but that was only for a mathematical point of time in order that he might give it out again to the great vassals of the Crown and that they in turn might give it out again to their vassals
But it cannot be said that at any time the king of Scotland had possession of the dominion utile of the land because he only claimed to have the right of superiority
Certainly  I apprehend that is the creature of statute
It was
I do not think the Crown would have been very wise to have refused them I think the vassals would have been very ready to help themselves
From my knowledge of the circumstances I should think not but I dont know
The granting of the charters according to my view was a mere matter of form in order to lay the foundation of the feudal system
As a matter of my own general knowledge I should say no  but I have not looked at the matter so carefully as to give such a distinct answer as I should like to be pledged to
Yes occasionally and by other people too
I think sir that a great fallacy underlies that
The paper and parchment rights of the great nobles of these days to the land were just about worth the paper and parchment they were written on they held them by their sword and by their strength
They held them by their vassals and in order to understand their position I think you must go back to the expiry of the previous period in which the original members of the clan or sept were the proprietors in fee simple of the great part of the sept land
Those were the original members of the sept or the clan and that is a very different thing indeed from having been the people because there was nothing more exclusive than the Celtic clan or sept unless it were the Saxon gemote which was equivalent to it and nobody had any right in the sept lands except they were born within the strict purple of the sept or the Saxon equivalent
And those clansmen who came to hold the lands of those days held them under the great vassals of the Crown and we see them now in the lairds and other people who hold of the great vassals or of the Crown
But the common people who formed the great mass who defended Scotland were the dependants of those great houses and of their vassals and they had no personal right in their land  they were the dependants of those who had
Yes
Of course if they did not fulfil the obligations imposed upon them then their corresponding rights would fall
They had no right to do that to those to whom they had granted the lands unless they forfeited by irritancy
But there was a vast number of the poorer classes in Scotland who were not of that class they were dependants of that class and they were very much in the habit of doing with them as they liked as all early communities did
Every early community in the world did so and the more the matter is studied the more clearly that appears
Unquestionably
A very large proportion of the population of Scotland in those days were persons who were in the position of serfs of which there were two classesone allodial serfs attached to the land and who went with the estate and the other personal serfs whom the great lords of the day employed as their personal servants to cultivate their domain lands
That was the class of people who made up the noble peasantry of that day and no doubt the relations thus stated roughly seem to our modem ears very severe but in those days the relations between man and man were more close than they are now they were more of a family than a legal connection
If by people you mean those below the rank of landholders I answer unhesitatingly yes there were no such rights known to the Scottish people of that day
That is a somewhat deceptive view of the case  it might have been their right but it would have been their wrong too because they would have been doing irreparable injury to themselves their whole strength lay in maintaining the population about them so that the question could never practically assume the position you are now putting
That leads up to a very different question
As you put it it would seem as if it was a matter of policy of choice on the part of the landowners  it was the force of circumstances which was more powerful than their will when society developed
If you will think what a Highland chieftain was in those days or even a Scotch laird he depended on his own home and those around him for his maintenance in every way
There was no exchange at all almost of commodities in those days men lived upon themselves and were selfsufficing and selfcontained
When society advanced and circumstances arose which forced foreign commodities upon them and the local necessities which had employed a great many of these men and made them at once the retainers and the necessary allies of their landlords came to an end their  employment ceased because their place was taken by others
The chief got his coat from Galashiels instead of from his own glen and the man who wove it was not dismissed from the glen because he was no longer necessary there but was dragged by the irresistible force of modern circumstances to Galashiels or elsewhere where he could ply his trade
I hardly follow the question
That assumes that the State is to take charge of these people as the Highland proprietors took charge of their population
I can see no such duty devolving on the State with reference to any part of its population
And if you say that that devolves upon the State as regards part of the population it seems to me to lead up to a system of direct communismyou have no haltingplace
I cannot and I dont think you would propose that a distinction should be made by the State in favour of any section of its citizens at the expense of the rest that it should subsidize crofters out of the taxes paid by other labourers
Certainly not and that would be coercing the laws of nature instead of cooperating with them
Economic laws are are just as powerful and irresistible as those of physics and you may just as well attempt to stem the ocean as to stem the progress of events and social circumstances they are equally beyond control and the wise policy is to cooperate with and not to thwart them
I understand it was that was deemed necessary for the safety of the imperial empire
I have not read it recently but I am familiar with his views
I believe there are numberless commons in England and it is one of the beauties of the country
Not of any extent that I know of
That is so
I wont venture to express any opinion upon the legal question but upon the moral and political point I have no doubt he was right
I think in the division of commons more regard should have been had to that innominate right which the public had as to their use and that this has in many cases been lost sight of
Yes
Yes
That is a matter of right I was speaking only of what lawyers call the servitude ludendi
The people I apprehend if the people had any right no lawyer on earth could defeat it  but the right which the law has not recognised and which I regret it has not is that innominate right which the people possess by long use of using commons as places of recreation and resort and amusement which we so much want
It was to that I referred and not to a pecuniary right such as the right to use it for the grazing of a cow
If a man had that right ho was entitled to have it protected
It has  you are referring to the question of small crofters
Quite that
Yes
At no other time of course
Yes
The old people remain in their old houses until they die and the young people provide for themselves elsewhere
As cottars paying no rent
Yes
Yes
A good many of them  some of them were paupers before and a good many of the  people who now occupy their old houses I have no doubt now are upon the poors roll
No  the result has been that the poor rates have diminished onehalf over the whole of these lands therefore everybody in these two parishes has benefited in that respect by the operation
The paupers who are now on the roll I have no doubt would have been on the roll although they had continued in their crofts and it has not been because of their removal from their crofts that they have been reduced but as years crept upon them and they were no longer able to work they would naturally have fallen into that position
They might and no doubt in some cases they would  but it does not quite follow as a necessary result that they would
I think the tendency would have been for them to have gone where they could have carried their labour to a better market because these small crofts were quite incapable of recompensing  fair labour
I have no doubt they would have followed the natural bent of every man to better himself and would not have wasted their labour on crofts which would not repay their labour
I do not say in all cases  I am afraid far from it
Those who got the crofts adjoining their own  liked it and others did not That is just human nature
Going back to the original crofter I have no doubt he came to the ground finding it nothing more than a moor that he built a very bad house and gradually broke in land round about about him and that he paid no rent
After a while his position there no doubt attracted the notice of the ground officer or the laird and a rent was imposed upon him
At a further stage he would rise to the level at which he would require a lease and then economic laws would begin to operate
Where that lease was granted in many cases provision was made according to an elaborate system in the north of Scotland of meliorations  and for several years after Mr Lindsays appointment we had a considerable number of people to settle with on the ground of meliorations
That was one type
Another type was where the rent was modified in respect of the improvements effected
That was the type which Mr Lindsay and I preferred and which we have invariably acted upon
Certainly
Certainly  that is the raison d treoi the form of lease which we have which imposes on the tenant the obligation to bring into cultivation certain land and that is as much a part of the rent as a money consideration
Yes
Yes
During the time of the predecessors of Mr Mackenzie such obligations were given and it devolved upon us as representing Mr Mackenzie to deal with them
But Mr Lindsay and I had no power to give obligations which would have affected the successors of Mr Mackenzie and therefore even if we had preferred that system it was not in our power
There was no compensation due
That is so
In the position in which I and my predecessors stand we have no power whatever to be indulgent but in all these cases there is a certain latitude permitted and I think I stretched that to the utmost
I think it would be extremely dangerous and I dont think the Legislature could be induced to pass the law
Yes
The rent from the crofters
Oh no
The rent of course was very much increased in consequence of the bringing in of arable land at the end of the crofters leases
The rental of the estate has increased but nothing in that proportion
There has been a very large increase on the Highland part of the estate in that period there are two distinct parts of the estate
I think the increase has been from about  to 
Yes but that must be qualified by this statement that it represents a very large expenditure of money
There is nothing like that increase in the net return to the proprietor because out of that he has to pay a very large sum annually for money borrowed for improvements
I think it very likely
Yes
Yes but the expenditure upon the poor has materially increased in the interval
Yes but the poor are very much better off
Which I am glad to say
Yes
I do
I should ask your Lordships permission to occupy ten minutes in answering a number of people in three counties in the north of Scotland with which I have to do and then I shall if you will allow me give my own views on the subject
 Before making any statement of my own I wish to reply to statements made by delegates from the island of Raasay from Rosehall in Sutherlandshire and from Strathkyle in Rossshire I shall do this in the fewest possible words
Fair rent  Fixity of tenure   Compensation for unexhausted improvements  An extension of their hill grazings by cutting up the sheep farms
This means their idea of rent in short that they and their friends should be the judges of what the rent should be
They say that they want the rent to be fixed by Government valuators but however it is accomplished they wish their rents to be onehalf or less than they are now
Adam Mackay who gave evidence from my property in Strathkyle is a case in point
He was an utter stranger to me
Two or three years ago he offered  for a croft which I accepted
He now says that he pays s for meadow land and that it ought not to be more than s
I believe the land to be good value for what he pays and he must have thought so too before the agitation began else why did he take it
I paid this year  s for Highland yearold stirks which I could have bought some years ago for s
What would the crofter who reared them think if I had proposed to buy them at valuation
My experience has been that when a croft was rented too low it has been managed in a more slovenly careless thriftless manner in consequence
I can state without fear of contradiction that the crofters rents throughout the Highlands are generally speaking extremely moderate
In proof of this I would point out that a months snow or frost in the Highlands does not send the people abegging as it does in England
No crofter works half his time counting ten hours in a day and six days in a week  and in what other business I would ask can a labourer live by working half his time
I have written about the crofters and Highland peasantry generally twentyfive years ago and I expressed the same views then that I do now
I have been an enthusiast for fixity of tenure and have pretty extensively tried perpetual fixity and nineteen years and I find both to be a mistake
I find a lease to be of no use to the landlord with this class of people and that it hurts the landlord alone
The tenant does not heed its conditions but he uses it as an engine against the landlord on all possible occasions
The delegate at Rosehall said that since the tenants got perpetual feus they have improved less than they did as tenants at will
No improvement of any kind can be made on an estate if the crofters are to have fixity of tenure
One or two illustrations will show how it would work
When I owned the islands of Raasay and Rona I found things going on as they had done hundreds of years before
The tenants of Rona held their land in runrig
The arable land is only strips and patches among the rocks
No arable land could be had except in these long straggling strips
If there were ten men in a township it might be thought absurd that every patch of land should be divided into ten pieces
But that would be a trifling matter
The fact is that if there was only one acre in a piece of ground the top of it would be divided into ten pieces and the middle of it into ten pieces and the bottom of into ten pieces so that an acre would be divided into thirty pieces in all
The consequence was that in the whole island there was not a piece of land bigger than an ordinary room
And to crown the absurdity of the whole thing every man changed his lot every year so that the ground a man had this year he would not have again for ten years
I divided this ground among them and gave every man his own lot and raised his rent  and he would be much better off by paying the increased rent under the new conditions than if he had got it under the old system for nothing
But what could have been done in that case if the crofters had fixity of tenure
They abused me for what I did for them as heartily as ever they abused Dr Mackenzie for his labours among them at Gairloch but I would not leave them as they were on that account
Again  The townships of Balchurn and Raasay was about  feet above the sea
The crofters there carried all the seaweed up these  feet on their backs to cultivate the land by means of it
I saw the utter absurdity of the whole thing
I took the land from them another case of howling but I left them in their houses with patches of potato land and told them I would employ them constantly at s a week and that they would have to pay me Is a week for the holdings left with them
I did it in this way as some pressure to induce them to work
I really intended that their wages should be s a week and that they should have their holdings for nothing
And that is practically how it was
But if a man was too lazy to work then he would have to pay me Is a week for his holding
They never made fourteen pence a week by the ridiculous work they had had previously
There is no horse in the islands except the proprietors and no fan to winnow corn
I calculated that the whole value of the crop they raised would not pay for their time and expenses at Portree when they went there and waited until the corn was ground into meal
If the crofters had fixity of tenure the landlords could not do anything to advance the people and I could give any number of cases similar to those I have stated
I shall now explain how perpetual fixity of tenure is not successful
Feus used only to be worth twentytwo and a half years purchase while ordinary land rents were worth thirtyfive years purchase
Highland estates wont now yield so much
Recent events have succeeded in driving capitalists out of the country and already Highland land is almost as unsaleable as land in Ireland
If a landlord feus in perpetuity a piece of land for  for which he previously got  s as rent he makes no profit whatever by the transaction
On the contrary he makes a loss because superiorities are not so saleable as ordinary rents
Thus then unless the landlords property is confiscated tenants cannot have perpetual fixity of tenure for less than  per cent above their present rents
Those waste lands at Rosehall which have been alluded to which I feued at s and s per acre were worth s to s per acre as an ordinary rent including the shooting
But if the feuar does not instantly set to work to reclaim his land the feuduty must very soon ruin him and I have always distinctly told them so
If then what the Rosehall delegate says is true that they improved less than they did as tenants at will that explains why the system does not succeed
Further a number of the feuars took to borrowing money on the security of the feus at a high rate of interest amounting with expenses to about  per cent just as the Ryots do in India and the interest of that money became heavier to bear than an ordinary rent would be
And land improvement companies in Aberdeen and elsewhere are much more inexorable creditors than Highland landlord
In fact as long as land owning is considered a luxury and it is a very costly luxury nowadays and men are found to be satisfied with  per cent for their money it is impossible that poor people can afford the luxury
A feuar is of course you understand a landlord
The man who uplifts the feuduty is called the superior but he has no interest in or rights over the land whatever except to uplift the feuduty
If even confiscation were attempted and the lands ware parcelled out among the crofters rich men would gradually buy them out and things would byandbye go on precisely as before except that the present generation of tenants would profit by the transaction
Rosehall Sutherland and Culrain Easter Ross they amounted to  acres between them
Yes
Yes
About  I think
Sir James Matheson
Two gentlemen in Inverness
They weretwo of the principal solicitors in the north of Scotland in fact
I was an engineer and valuator of land
Yes
I found the shooting let for  with the mansion house which I may say cost  to build and there was a large sheep farm rented about  I think there was only one big farm and the rest was in the hands of crofters or small tenants
About twenty I think
All in one group at Altos township
Yes
A bit
I could not be sure perhaps a thousand acres I cannot be positive but something like that
About 
Yes I state that in my paper
Yes it was largely
But I took advantage of the land speculation to see what I could do about the crofters because I had taken a great interest in that question all my life previously
It was my doing  entirely all that was done for the crofters it was at my instance it was done
Some two or three or perhaps four years
I held it after they went out
They did  and then I sold all my interest to Mr Tennant

No I had the largest share
Yes
I could not tell exactly that I had more than the half of it at first and at the end I had it all
Yes between us three
Of course a great deal more because it yielded about  at the end it was worth double the money we paid for it
The shooting rent explains that
There was a mansion house which as I have said cost  and it with the shooting was let for  and since then the shooting alone has been yielding  and it was that which principally made the profit upon the transaction it was the shooting rent
I dont know that I can exactly answer that
I gave one of my partners  of profit and the other 
Yes roughly
It was all sold to Mr Tennant he got the last of it
Roughly about 
Yes
Mostly
Yes
It is very difficult to say from memory certainly  of it
It was not nearly so much
I sold  worth of wood which should have been cut down fifteen years before a great deal of it was ninety and one hundred years old and it was rotting on the ground
Some of it certainly should have been cut down thirty years before I got it
I cut  worth of it when I bought the estate and you would not miss the wood now it looks as well as ever it did
I cannot be sure of that
I got a plan made first and then I divided the land giving each man his house and his arable land and a certain piece of the improvable hill ground in addition to it for the very purpose that he might have work during his idle time when it would cost him nothing and that at last he would have a compact parallelogram to himself  whereas formerly they all held their land higgledypiggledy
Yes always adjoining
Not at all
Just so
What they would have liked was to be let alone
I suppose so
Yes
My statement said expressly that they asked me to leave them on nineteen years leases instead of giving them feus and that they would pay me the same rent if I would do so
They were afraid of the feus because they were a new thing and they did not understand them but they understand them now
No I did not give any small tenants leases I gave them all feus
No except those who had leases before
Well it never was an option in that way
Highland crofters never think of leaving on any consideration
There was no talk of option
I dont know I am not very sure
If they had all stood out I dont think I would have been so hard as to turn them away
I am sure I would not
If they did not like it and did not understand and did not trust me I certainly would not have faced the idea of turning out twenty crofters
I have brought in crofters largely and did not want to turn them away
I did not do such a thing and am not capable of doing it
They said they did not want feus and would prefer leases but I knew better than themselves what was good for them  it was very much better for them to have feus than to have leases
They are very much better off now with perpetual feus than with leases
There has been a change in the ownership of the estate and there may be another but that wont affect them now
Yes
Certainly I never would have removed a whole township
Certainly not
I never did such a thing and would not do it  I would have given in if they had combined in that way even although doing so would not have been for their own good
Yes I would  I have often done it
No none of it was made plantation
I did not plant any of the land
That was another estate  my own estate in Rossshire
About a thousand acres
No
It was feued out in separate lots as moor ground alone
Well not the whole of it but a good deal of it was  most of it was I believe
It was all thrown open to the public as feus and they took it up where they liked
No I think they all got feus every one of them
I dont knowthe hill ground and all I did not count that up
Somebody said it was   perhaps it was
I cannot tell
No  you see it gets mixed because they got the shooting and that was the most valuable thing on the whole property
They got the shooting as well as the land and that was paying a couple of thousand pounds a year
But that has been deteriorated now by these crofts
I cannot single out what the crofts would be alone
The shooting rent is the most valuable part of that moor ground it is worth more as shooting than grazing
No
Well it is sold to three or four different parties but after I had sold twothirds of the estate I got about  of shooting rent I think for the remaining third
The proprietors who bought the other parts shoot over them themselves so that I cannot say what the rent is
I know one shot  brace of grouse last year but as I said I calculate that the shooting which formerly yielded about  now yields about  would do so in the market
I think they just about paid their old rents except that the hill was taken from them
Just so  which they were much better without according to my humble opinion
It was doing them no good and it was a great loss to me
I dont think it is a good thing for small tenants to have big ranges of hill
I think so roughly
I am only speaking roughly from memory
I think it is about that
Well there might have been a little
I dont hke to say definitely because somebody might bring up statistics showing it was different
Not much
I feued the land at   an acre and charged s or s for moor so that the arable land was not raised at all
They were not paying more than they were paying as rent
It is very marvellous  I dont believe it
This man John Sutherland is a gentleman now and he was a very poor man when I took him up and yet he comes and makes a complaint that he was illused
I never was so astounded as at that man coming up
I made a man of him
Well as a rule
You see this man was about the most successful of the whole of them
When I feued the land this man came in first and got the best of it and now he is well off and then the next who came in did not get so good a piece and so on
I dont say they are all false
I was referring to this man who made a complaint
If they dont improve the crofts it cannot do them any good to have a feu but a man who will work industriously will make himself comfortable
An industrious man it pays to have fixity of tenure but not a lazy fellow
I think it does and it should and it did there
A number have done remarkably well
Yes to a good many of them but I have been disappointed to find that to some of them it has not
The old tenants who had houses already and arable land to begin withit suited them admirably but to men who had to do everything on the open moor to begin life and build housesit was too heavy for them they had not enough money to bring them round
They had to keep their families when all this was going on and build houses and they went and borrowed money from improvement companies in Aberdeen and elsewhere at enormous interest and that crushed them
The feuduty was s generally
Some say I charged s and it may have been so
From s to s an acre never more
But your Lordship never heard before of feus having been given off at s an acre  it was always leases
Nobody but me ever gave a feu off at s an acre
Yes but then he does not interfere with the shooting the lease does not give him the shooting which is worth s d an acre and that makes a great difference
Some of themit is one of the greatest damages to the estate of Rosehalltake out their whole feuduty in trapping game and that is what damages the whole estate
They put out stacks of corn at this time of the year and set traps anybody who knows about sport knows that in that way you can gather in all the black game round about the country and the game which they get they sell and pay the feuduty
Nobody can punish them because it is their own land and that is one of the greatest evils connected with that plan of feuing land
They are doing that now and are spoiling a shooting which was one of the finest in the whole Highlands
I could not do that I cannot reserve anything when I feu when I feu I sell
No if I could I would
I wanted to give them fixity of tenure
I knew the shooting was of no legitimate value to them and here is the way they make an illegitimate use of it
I am sorry to say it has  but I could not say it may not be successful yet if you have industrious people
I would not think of giving a whole township feus again but if there was a smart man I would give him a feu where it would not interfere with the shooting
But as a rule it would not do to give the whole body of them fixity of tenure
Yes pretty much and it wont do at all unless they have a start with houses and some arable land to begin with
I dont believe in squatting a man on the moor and giving him a piece of land at any price and telling him to do good with it  they cannot do it
You mean in feuing land
That is what is going on all over the Highlands and his leases are not so good as almost any in the Highlands because he can give them notice to quit at four months by paying them for improvements
Exactly that is the main pointlooking after the property and seeing it is not neglected
They are not I am sure of it
They are people who ought to be taken in hand by intelligent men and managed just as you would children
Yes I have often thought of it if there were any means by which an Encumbered Estates Act could be brought in as it was in Ireland and give every facility to some of these landlords who can do nothing for the people to get rid of their estates
It is where the landlords are excessively poor and have no money to spend that the misery is you never hear of misery where there is a solvent and resident landlord
I would it would be a great boon to the Highlands if there were greater facilities given to people who like the dog in the manger cannot get rid of big estates
Some landlords would hail it though they dont ask for such a measure but if the Government would bring it in a great number would take advantage of it and it would greatly benefit the West Highlands of Scotland
Your Lordship has seen no destitution I think except on estates of that kind unless on an estate that is utterly neglected and many of them are utterly neglected
Lewis is the only exception and the cause there is mismanagement and neglect entirely
I know most of them in four counties and I have looked round and where the proprietor is resident and solvent I dont see anything the matter with the people
It is not so much want of judgment or of means as just simple neglectignoring them that is the worst thing the crofters have to complain of
It is not oppression but neglect they have to complain of  that is the thingwhen the landlord does not take any interest in them
Where the landlord takes an interest in them there they are thriving and prosperous where he takes no interest in them there they are all going wrong
Yes
They are fast getting out of it if they were only let alone
They are getting on splendidly
There is an enormous difference within the last twentyfive years in the condition of those people
When I began to employ labour I could get any number of men at s aweek and I cannot get them now for s or s aweek and tea sugar and all the necessaries of life are cheaper now than they were then  so that whatever condition the crofter is in now he is in the best condition he has been in since the creation
I say it advisedly there is not a doubt about it
If there is poverty in the Highlands now there was much greater poverty before
Every Skye man I employ gets s d aday and being industrious frugal good men they live on fourpence a clay and save the s d every penny of of it
They never spend a penny in drink or anything else but go back to their families in Skye and live in a dormant state till the s d is done  and then they come and work to me again
They dont take any improvement in their condition as a stepping stone to move upwards as long as they have meal and potatoes they wont work
I dont know why it is it is a very curious thing
I offered to build houses for these menI suppose you have seen the dens they live in in Skye and let them bring their families to my property I thought it was hard for them to have to go back and forward but not one of them would look at the proposal they would go back to Skye and vegetate there
That is their enjoyment and it is a great pity other people should interfere with their enjoyment if they enjoy themselves that way
They were building a silo for ensilage
Any there are no better people than they are that way
They are tractable and industrious and never get drunk or give trouble
Yes and planting
Capital at anything but they are like children  I have always a skilled man over them
I never put a Skye man over them
A Skye man is only a machine but a useful machine
They write and ask if I will take them on and my man writes back that he will
Yes and they go when they like
If they get tired of it and want to go home and enjoy themselves they will go off the next day and I never hear any more about it  and when they come back I employ them again
They would work at home if the proprietors would go ahead with all sorts of work the same as I do
If the proprietors would do that and put their properties right at home the Skye men would not need to come to me but when the proprietors cannot do anything then the men must come out
If they could get meal and potatoes at home they would not
Certainly just as well as they do away if they were put under direction in a squad
There is any amount of work in Skye if there were men of wealth to do it
The island is in a state of nature there is no improvement in it
Thousands of pounds might be profitably employed in Skye
I could not point out all the ways
There is not a bit of land in the island which would not yield three times the crop it does if it were properly worked but it would require people to take an interest in that
I am sure of it they never were so well off in the world as they are now
I dont believe them
It is always fine to speak about old times old times are always fine times with everybody the times of our grandfathers
There never were any times in the world like the present
It has been frightfully exaggerated
This spring I wanted a lot of work done and I wished to have Skye men but they preferred to stick at home this year waiting for the Lord Mayors money and I saw afterwards they got doled out to them s d whereas they might have been earning  with me in the spring
This is what came of collecting money for them in London
This kind of thing making the people suppose they are to get money from others to support them is the worst thing that could possibly happen them I would rather the Lord Mayors money had been put into the sea
I dont know about that the proprietors would help them
There never was a Highland proprietor who would allow his people to starve if other people would let them alone
A gentleman once asked me did you ever see a Skye man who did not look as if he got porridge and milk
I went to hear Professor Blackie lecturing in the Grassmarket on the Sunday night and if they had seen the congregation he had they could have seen nothing like it in Skye
I wish the worthy Professor and all the other agitators would only look at the slums of Edinburgh and let the Highlands alone
You never saw anything like the destitution and misery there is in the low parts of Edinburgh and 
There is no end of room for patriotic effort there if it were only taken up
The Highlander at home is in paradise compared with the people in the alleys and closes of a great city
I dont think it was very nice of him then he ought to have applied to Lady Matheson
If the estate were properly managed there ought to be nothing of that sort wanted
Lady Matheson is a lady and cannot manage much but efficient management would avoid it
I dont know the worst thing that happens them is when help is given
There is a worse thing than destitution and that is illadvised charity
I dont think it would have been starvation  you never heard of a case of starvation in the Highlands
I never heard of one and I have lived all my life there
They always get porridge and milk and they look well upon it
There never was a case of starvation
I challenge anybody to show a case of it
There are cases in London and Edinburgh and nobody knows about them
But in the Highlands everybody knows where there is necessity and they help one another and they let others know about it
I would infinitely rather be in the worst place in those islands than in the closes of Edinburgh whatever the wage might be
I dont think so
There are  people in Glasgow living in houses of one room
Conceive the condition of things where that is the case
Mr Bright stated that the other day and I think that indicates a state of things infinitely worse than anything you could find in the West Highlands
I think so
The best thing that I think can come out of this Commission will be that proprietors will have their attention turned to the crofters and look after them more than they have done
Two  but I have the books
I have the books of the old Macleods of Raasay for eighty years
Yes  I did not buy it to speculate but I got into bad health and was advised to leave the island
No
A trifle about  apiece and the average rent about that time was s
It was called about  per cent but it does not matter although it was  per cent   is nothing for a crofter to pay for three cows grazing
When they were paying s of rent a lot were complaining they were too high  s would not do much good to a starving man
Increasing the arable land
No they have thousands of acres of pasture land now
They have far too much  it is the very thing that is doing them mischief
Not one of them had not three cows and stirks and a few sheep and that kind of thing  and if he had nothing else surely s is not a big rent for all that
I think any man would be a fool who expected on a s croft to maintain a family
I have heard a great deal of talk about that as if a s croft could keep a family
Nobody intended that it is impossible  it is intended as a home for a man from which he can go and work otherwise at fishing or labouring or as a tradesman or anything else
He could not expect to support a family out of a s croft
Some of them did support their families
I dont exactly remember the rents they would be s rents on an average
In a way they did  but they generally fished
I dont know what proportion of their time was spent upon the croft and what upon fishing
That is what I have always said make fishermen of them especially in Raasay where there are plenty fish
I did everything I could to get them to fish
No because I would be a fool to do that it would be the foolishest thing in the world to make crofters of them instead of fishermen
The thing is to make fishermen of them and give them houses and potato land from which they can go to fish that is the thing to make men of the West Highlanders
My own crofters are pretty well off at Kyle and they keep their sons when they come home and are pretty comfortable
No the land and the climate are not suitable
All over
I have hundreds of acres of land I could improve at Glengloy but I would not be such a fool
You could grow oatmeal far cheaper on the prairies in America than you could at Kilmuir
It is a splendid country for sheep and that is what the crofters know nothing about  but it is not a place for growing meal
Let them take their food out of the sea
No they have no grazing there like ours
No not in mutton
It may in beef but they cannot produce a blackfaced piece of mutton like ours  it is impossible
I am certain  it is the wildest dream possible to speak about cultivating the land there
It is a splendid country and nature has adapted it for sheep and I cannot understand any wise person suggesting that it ought to be cultivated because nature has not adapted it for cultivation
It is fighting against nature altogether
You can get meal for s a boll from abroad and you cannot possibly cultivate corn at such a price it would cost five times the money sometimes
Yes they should most certainly
All the people on the West Highland coast should take their living out of the sea except trifles for milk for their families
Any man who begins to enlarge the crofts I think will only be doing the crofters mischief
I dont know beginning at Mull opposite Oban and up to Cape Wrath
I would not do that until you make them better fishermen
I think the wise thing is not to develop farmers but to develop fishermen
No  they are not fit for it
I tried it on the east coast where they are more intelligent and a better class than on the west
They are like children and would get into a state of torpidity
That is so  they are not fit for it
You require to have a man of some intelligence before you give him that
Always that is it  and that is the way I say you must select the man you would give fixity of tenure to
Some men it is a capital thing for but not for those West Highlanders you must get them educated first
To give them fixity of tenure it has not and I hope it never will
I have experience with much better men than they and if it fails with better men it cannot help failing with them
On the east coast Rosehall and Culrain
It has faded
It has failed with some and not with others
Yes there is a lot of bad proprietors as well as tenants but an Act of Parliament wont make bad proprietors nor bad tenants good
Quite so
Some of them do very well on the east coast but not all round
I would not give indiscriminate fixity of tenure on the east coast but I woidd not give it at all to the people on the west coast
I would not begin by putting a foolish man in power at all I think it is beginning at the wrong end
Yes but it would take a long time
It would be the very thing for the man who started it but if you know beforehand it would fail
If you are sure it would fail it would not be wise to try it
Not in the west yes I have in Oban
Very well but they are a differentclass of people there
People about the towns are different the ordinary west coast Highlander is a slow coach
I dont know if you know them as well as I do
No and I hope it never will
It would be deplorable to think that any west coast Highlander could ever descend so far  it is possible but I should be slow to believe it
I should hope not
Yes
Yes about twentyfive years ago
I have modified that view to this extent that it would cost more than double the money now to improve land than then
I dont recollect it
That it might be profitably reclaimedhundreds of thousands of acres
I hold that still but I dont think there is the same extent that can be profitably reclaimed now
Circumstances have altered and labour is more than double what is was twenty years ago
I do
I cannot remember that I made the statement within two years I hardly believe I can have said it within that time because labour has so much increased in cost
Formerly an acre of ground could be reclaimed for  now it costs about 
I think so
No doubt he will have to work when he goes there no mistake about that
No I would never like to see a man going away if he is profitably employed at home certainly not
One large farm
No I had no power it was all under lease
But if I had had the power I could not have done it
I think it would have been going backwards
Because they are the finest people I think on the face of the earth
It is both ways
No I cannot not equally good for working
They are a first rate people a fine people
I have a written statement and I may say it is entirely suggestive of remedies for present grievances
I am the son of a crofter and from earliest years until the twentythird year of my age I wrought on a Highland croft of about three and a half acres
I may say that for part of that time I was virtually a crofter because I had to manage for my widowed mother
The croft held by her and on which I was brought up and laboured was at Brora in Sutherlandshire
I may state that my mother with her parents were evicted from Dunrobin Glen at the time of the Sutherlandshire clearances
They got a small space at Backies in the neighbourhood of Golspie to convert into a croft
At her marriage my mother settled in the village of Golspie
Shortly after the death of my father she was with a family of five removed by the factor at the instigation of a stepson to the croft at Brora
I wish in this statement and in my verbal evidence to refer to my personal knowledge and experience of the life of a crofter and to state briefly what after a lifelong study I consider to be the best means for their improvement
In order that my position may not be misunderstood I have to state that I hold no extreme or radical views on the land question
I am no communist
I do not wish to exterminate landlords
Only as a lover of my  fellow countrymen and as a patriot for the question has a most important national aspect I appeal to Highland landlords to remember that property has its duties as well as its rights and to entreat them to attend to these duties ere it be too late
The discharge of their duties to the tenants will result in such advantages to themselves as will amply reward them
The path of duty here is plain and thoroughly practicable
It requires no legislation
The landlords have the means and ample power at their disposal for the discharge of their duty
I may state without enumerating them that the crofters have many real substantial grievances
I consider the greatest of these grievances to be the painful depressing feeling produced on their minds by the fact that they are mere tenants at willthat they are absolutely at the disposal of the landlord or rather of the factor
The factor was monarch of all he surveyed and with his right or rather power there was none to dispute
I have often analysed my own feelings as a crofter especially in connection with what transpired at and after the Disruption and I always arrived at the same conclusion namely that entire dependence on and being completely at the mercy of the factor produced a feeling the most depressing I might add the most demoralising
I desire to speak with the utmost respect of the Sutherland family
More kindhearted and indulgent landlords did not exist than the members of that family who were in possession of the estate during my residence in the county
I am satisfied they were ignorant of most if not of all the harsh treatment received at the hands of the factor and the other officials but it was done in their name and they must therefore be held responsible
I shall first refer to the extent of land held by the crofter
My own experience coincides with the evidence given everywhere that the croft is far too small to enable a family to live in comfort
This brings me to one of the chief causes of all the grievances complained of
If the crofter is to be located in the Highlands he must have sufficient land to maintain himself and his family properly
The amount of land held by him must be sufficient for his proper maintenance independent of external resources such as fishing c
A certain amount of stress is being laid on the fishing as a source of subsistence to the crofter
The fishing round our western and northern coasts is too important to be considered merely as supplementary to the crofters means of living
Besides the two industries farming and fishing are so entirely incompatible that they cannot be combined
Application to the one unfits the individual for the other
Not only so but it must be evident that the one can be prosecuted only at the expense of the other
I mean of course continuous fishing that during the year including the herring and white fishings
The herring fishing as prosecuted in my early days on the east coast can be prosecuted by the crofter and that often very much to his advantage
The fishing then extended from the middle of July till the end of August
This involved an absence from his home of only six weeks and at a season of the year when he can be best spared from his croft
The fishing as a means of subsistence to the crofter must be altogether excluded in considering his improvement
The land alone must supply all that is required for this purpose
If the crofter has to supplement the produce of his croft for the support of his family and that of his stock he will come ultimately to bankruptcy poverty and ruin
My next proposition is that unless the crofter holds as much land as will admit of a regular rotation of crops the land will in the course of time become unproductive the capital and labour expended will have no adequate return
Poverty and ruin will be the result
Again the crofter from his surroundings and his remoteness from the great centres of industry and remunerative employment must be independent of all external sources of aid
His surroundings forbid him maintaining himself by wages
From the very nature of things the Highlands and Islands do not and cannot present such a field of employment as will enable him to live exclusively by wages
This as brought out in the evidence has been tried and failed
Sir Alexander Matheson settled several tenants on a part of his estate
They had a home and a plot of land provided
It was intended they should support themselves by wages
They found employment for a few years in making improvements on the estate
The improvements were completed
The men were thrown idle  in vain they looked for other employment in the district
By such arrangements the foundation of future famine and distress is being laid
The croft or farm must be to the Highland crofter his only visible means of living
I shall next refer briefly to the amount of land required for such a croft as I have indicated
The land divides itself into arable and hill pasture
If hill pasture for summer grazing cannot be had the amount of land constituting a croft should be at least thirty acres
On the other hand if hill pasture is available twenty acres would suffice
The crofter in order to succeed must be independent of the cooperative system so prevalent in the Highlands in which neighbouring tenants combine for ploughing and harrowing
This system is opposed to the proper cultivation of the land
To put it in another form whether there are the two arable land and hill pasture or arable land alone the crofter must in either case have a pair of horses
It will be noticed from the evidence given before the Royal Commissioners that the crofters are modest in their demands
I believe they are too modest
They ask a fair field and no favour
But for reasons for which they are not to blame they scarcely demand a fair field
The quantity of land they state as sufficient for a croft is too small
The one horse idea is not compatible with independence and complete success and comfort
There must be a pair of horses and as much land as will admit of a regular rotation of crops
My conclusion under this head is that it is not the duty of a Highland landlord to assign to a crofter less land than will maintain him and his family in comfort and leave at the years end a balance however small on the right side
Another subject I desire to touch on is the rent paid by the crofters
Are the rents too high or in other words are they rackrented
I think the evidence already given proves that in most parts of the Highlands and Islands rents are far too high
Highland estates when brought into the market command fabulous pricesprices out of all proportion to their agricultural and pastoral value
The unrivalled beauty of the scenery of the Highlands their adaptability for sport and now the formation of deer forests have completely revolutionised the value of landed property in the Highlands
The selling and letting of these are not on strictly commercial principles
Grouseshooting and deerstalking are for the pleasure of the few who can afford such an expensive luxury
The prices paid for these ought not to form an element in determining the rents paid for land in the Highlands for agricultural and pastoral purposes
It has been stated in evidence that these forests are not suitable for sheep and cattle
Sheep and cattle will subsist during summer where deer can
The land is of some value for summergrazing for sheep c
What then is the value of these forests considered as sheep pasture
I have read somewhere of a deer forest containing  acres or upwards of ninety square miles being let for  I may be wrong in the quantity of land given I tried but failed to verify the figures
The error is not I think so great as to sensibly affect my argument
Such land is capable of maintaining at least one sheep per  acres
If this be considered too low an estimate I am willing for the sake of argument to make it two sheep or even three per  acres although I believe I am nearer the truth at one sheep per  acres
What then would be the rent of such a forest as a sheep farm at the rate of   per  sheep
At the rate of one sheep per  acres the flock would be  sheep and rent    at two sheep the flock would be  and rent    and at three sheep the flock would be  and rent  instead of  This does not include winter keep so that   is too high a rent
Truly the lessees pay too dear for their whistles and landlords should remember that a whistle is not a toy that will always amuse
Pleasure and the sources of pleasure are always changing
The pleasures of today may not be those that will satisfy twenty years hence
The landlord therefore who resists the temptation and who instead of enforcing his rights kindly and  faithfully discharges the duties which Providence has laid upon him will in the end be the gainer
So much for deer forests and the influence of these artificial rents on lands in the Highlands
The rents paid by crofters may be tested in another way
Let us take the land held by them and place it alongside agricultural lands in the Lowlands for example land in the neighbourhood of our large towns and compared with these I will venture to say that any intelligent practical agriculturist will value them at less than half the value of the latter
Again transfer the agricultural land in the neighbourhood of our larger towns to the remote Highlands and Islands and it will be valued at least at one half its present value
From all these considerations I think I am justified in asserting that the rent paid is on an average quadruple what it should be
In the matter of rent and holding I might compare the condition of the Highland crofter with that of the Irish tenants who have been for some time and are still verging on rebellion because of the land question
From a residence of some years in Connaught and an intimate acquaintance with the tenants of that part of Ireland I could show that the condition of the Irish tenants is much superior to that of the Highland crofter
My contention is that the Highlands owing to the facilities for sport afforded by them must be removed from the list of subjects that come under the ordinary rules of commerce
If they are to become once more the home of the Highlander we must devise some plan of fixing a fair rent
With a fair rent and security against capricious removal he will soon by his conduct disprove the charges of indolence and laziness brought against him by ignorant and interested parties
I must shortly refer to the fishing
It is too important to be ignored altogether
I only insist on the crofters case being considered in relation to the land and apart altogether from the fishing
In determining his future condition the fishing ought not to form an element
At present he is compelled to try the fishing to procure the means of subsistence which the croft denies him
Should the fishing fail he is at his wits end and failure as a rule it is sure to be for the simple reason that from his impoverished state he is not able to avail himself of the best appliances for prosecuting the fishing
The success of the fishing is closely connected with a right solution of the land question
Give the crofter sufficient land on favourable terms
Let him have inducements to farm  properly and there will grow up in the course of time a surplus populationthat is a population whose labours will not be required on the croft or if required only to a limited extent
This surplus will in looking out for a sphere of employment naturally betake itself to the fishing which lies so invitingly at the very door
And this they will do all the more advantageously because they are not forced to it from necessity and also because of the capital basis of operation they have in the comfortable home on the croft or farm
They will engage in this industry not only free of debt but with the very best appliances
By such a settlement of the land question as I have suggested there would spring up a class distinct from the crofters a fishing population devoting itself exclusively to fishing
We would have soon on the west coast what has all along existed on the east coast of Ross Sutherland and Caithness two classes crofters and fishermen each devoting its whole time and all its energies to its own proper work
With such inducements and with the aid of steam now so largely employed the fishing on the west coast should soon outstrip that of the east
Farming and fishing cannot successfully be combined
I can see no objection to the fisherman having along with his house a plot of ground on which to grow vegetables or maintain a cow but more he cannot profitably cultivate
But lastly emigration is proposed as a remedy for the grievances complained of
Now emigration per se cannot be a remedy
Emigration has been tried once and again and it did not cure the evil
The crofters remaining are no better off
Their circumstances have not in the least been improved in consequence of the emigrations that took place
The reason is evident
Those emigrations were not carried out in order to effect an improvement in the condition of the crofters
They were carried out in order to convert the land into sheep farms
If the country is prepared to completely depopulate the Highlands emigration is the simplest and most effective remedy  but I do not believe the country will sanction such a remedy
Emigration may come in but only as auxiliary to a properly devised scheme for the improvement of the crofters
If in carrying out such a scheme it should be found necessary to remove  part of the population emigration may be resorted to although I believe the crofters can be improved without having recourse to emigration at all
There is abundance of land either cultivated or capable of cultiva tion to meet the whole cases
All that is required is a proper distribution of the land
The question has a national as well as a local aspect
What will most benefit the Highlands and at the same time be of most advantage to the nation
We are bound to look at both aspects of the question
Can both be combined
They can and I therefore oppose emigration and plead for the immediate and permanent improvement of the crofters
We cannot afford to have the country drained of the most loyal and lawabiding part of the people
We greatly need such nowadays when treason and rebellion are preached and practised so boldy in certain parts of the empire
The nation is healthy and strong which has its urban and rural population well balanced
The physical social and moral wellbeing of a country depends very much on a fair proportion of its population being rural
The tendency at present is and for some considerable time has been to drive the population from the country into the town
This tendency should be checked and the growth of a rural population promoted a loyal and Godfearing people which would be an honour to the country and its strength in the day of need
We may need their help sooner than any one anticipates especially when we contemplate the lapsed masses in our large towns lying seething and weltering at the base of the social columu threatening every moment to pull it down and overwhelm society in ruin
There is another aspect We greatly need a rural population and especially the Highland portion of it to supply labour for the various industries of the country
In conclusion let me assure all whom it may concern that the Highlanders treated as they ought to be are as ready now as in the past to tight our battles and defend our homes and altars
On the result of the present inquiry depends the attitude of the Highlanders to the throne and constitution
I do hope that they will not by the continued neglect of the country to their cry of distress be driven to sullen rebellion but that by timeous and wise legislation their respect for law and their loyalty to the throne will be maintained and strengthened
Well I may say that all along I have not been in favour of that
I have felt the effects of being first brought up in my infancy and boyhood speaking the Gaelic language alone so that when I came to use the English language and was forced to use it I had first to think in Gaelic and then translate it into English
In other respects moral and religious I am strongly in favour of the Gaelic language but for those who have to leave the Highlands and go to other parts of the world it is desirable they should be accustomed to and made to practise the English from their very earliest days
No further than that it is very useful and indeed necessary for the explanation of a phrase or sentence or word is better understood by a child who speaks Gaelic by giving it in Gaelic
Yes in order to enable him to teach the children more effectively in English
They would be very much better equipped for their duties if they knew Gaelic
Yes
Unfortunately after I went to Connaught where the Irish language is spoken which is very different from the Gaelic of the Highlands I got up the Irish language there in order to be able to speak to the people and instruct them and the acquiring of the Irish and practising it for five or six years knocked the old Highland Gaelic out of my head
Of course I understand it quite well and can speak it but very clumsily
Yes
Yes
Of course that would be the tendency of it  and although I am a Highlander and love my country and countrymen very well I am not blind to the tendency for the last fifty years that the Gaelic language is dying out and I am afraid it cannot be arrested
Unavoidable
I am aware of that
During the time Mr Hugh Matheson had the administration of the Lewis as commissioner I knew that that was done and that encouragement has been given to the people  but it has not been taken advantage of very largely for what reason I dont know
I have seen some of the houses built under the suggestion but I dont think it has been very largely taken advantage of
No I totally disagree with the statement that has been made about that for the simple reason that in the west of Scotland in the islands the fishing is not continuous
It is only the herring fishing during a certain part of the season and then the ling and cod during another certain part and then they go to other places for the fishing but still the fishing is not continuous as on the east coast
Besides they have no market for the fish
They have simply to fish for curers and they get a wretched price according to the prices given in the south
These men can never live upon their fishing alone but if they have a bit of land on the produce of which they can partially live and the stock of which could pay the rent of the croft they have a home and have that land to work upon when they are not at their ordinary industry
I dont think the other system would suit in any part of the Highlands that I know of and I know the Highlands from Cape Wrath to the Mull of Cantire pretty well
I dont know a corner where that system could be adopted
Where the fishing is carried on I dont think the two could be successfully dissociated
I believe the habits of the people and the requirements of the case would always demand that they should have land less or more and I think the smallest portion they should have is just what I have stated
Yes I quite agree with that but the centre of the Lewis is for the most part a sort of morass only fit for summer grazing which could not be utilised for arable land
But still there are corners where they could not have access to the sea and where the crofts ought to be larger than I have mentioned
I have only referred to the class of fishermen crofters living near the sea
No I never dreamt of such things because the people in their petition specified it was only when the lease was out
They dont contemplate any violent breach of the law
They only want the land when out of lease and the farm of Park happened to be out of lease and an arrangement could have been made in that case
I oppose emigration and I oppose emigration for the next century in the Highlands
I oppose it on principle
I know for a fact that there is plenty of land in the Highlands if it could be utilised for the present population and secondly I object to emigration because the strong are sent away and the weak are retained
I oppose it again because these people are deprived of their religious privileges
According to the statement I heard here yesterday from the Canadian agent I find they are so scattered and wide spread that access to means of grace and access to education cannot be had by the people as it is just now and they prize those privileges more than anything else
I oppose it also because these people if forced to go away will not retain the patriotic feeling towards our land that they should have in the colonies
Altogether
Yes
I have specified crofts of five or six acres
Yes and for the crofters where they are too close and the crofts are not of the size I have specified
I have specified the size I would apply to the whole island and I would make that apply to the crofters as well as the cottars
I believe in some places land can be far better cultivated by hand than by the plough
I myself have wrought the spade to some extent and I believe the land can be cultivated far more thoroughly and better in some places by the spade than the plough and I know in some parts of the Lewis it is so
Yes
Of course it takes time but in many cases here time is not such a consideration
I hold that if the people had the land in that way there would be no famine at all
I believe it arises from the present miserable arrangements
The acreage of the Lewis is  acres
The population is  over all including Stornoway and that would leave a pretty large acreage to each individual
Exactly
Well say six acres of arable
Let us take  of a crofter population leaving out the people of Stornoway altogether
Although some members of a family dont work the land the whole year there are some members who are always about it in some way or other
The head of the family might not be engaged but some members of the family are always engaged about the croft
I think Mr Mackay the chamberlain gave a case in which he let a farm last year to crofters and in which the cattle were specified at one for every  of rental
I gave less so far as I remember
He would not get both rent and living
The produce would not support himbut I hold it ought to pay the rent
Exactly so
Yes
To say that more than half the land is under crofters is certainly not a correct statement because I know the farm of Park is fully a third of the whole surface of the Lewis and there is not a single crofter in it
I know again that in Knock the most populous parish there are Dignish and Gormiclete and another and I know these three farms are pretty nearly as large as what the crofters have
They are at least twothirds of what the crofters have
My opinion is different certainly
No
I hold this with regard to it
Mr Mackay the chamberlain made a computation of the rent per acre and the land in possession of the large farmers and the land in possession of the crofters and he maintained that the land in the hands of the large farmers yielded a larger rental per acre than that in the hands of the crofters but he refrained studiously from giving you any conception of the quality of the land
I hold that the land of the crofters is in the meantime doubly rented compared with the land held by the large farmers for this reason that to form these large farms the best of the land was taken as in all other places in the Highlands
But there is a question in connection with it
In connection with the large farms there is a far larger extent of arable ground and I should like to know if the chamberlain included the bogs and moors which go under the name of grazing for the crofters
That settles the question
My answer would simply be this  Yes I will look at the question if you will give me the kind of land but I will hand you back  acres of the land in the hands of the crofters for  acres of the land in the hands of the large farmers
Of course the demands of human nature are very unreasonable sometimes but it is not what they would demand but what they could properly use
Yes I know it is very different from what would be required in the Knapdales and other places
Yes
Yes my idea is not the present farm of  rental but in some cases away  from the sea I would have crofts of  and that ought to include land and stock to keep a man engaged and to support him also
I know in the past history of Lewis that crofts of that kind supported them in comfort and enabled them to educate their families well
Yes a large number
There is of course this in connection with it as to their grazings which they used to have in summer
They used to go to the sheilings in summer for two months and let the pasture at home rest
There has been a tax put upon them for that of s for every cow and d for every sheep and they have to appoint a shepherd
I dont know whether the factor pays the shepherd and taxes them at the rate of d or not but that is done and this in their state of poverty with those cottars about them
There is a son married and he gets a bit of the croft a daughter is married and she and her husband get a bit of the croft and of course the croft is spoiled on the family because of the wretched arrangement that has been going on for years
tt would increase it considerably
Yes
They could make it a far better thing
They could manure it better and work it better
By being at the fishing they might afford to pay  for a house and the comforts of a bit of land while the larger farmer could not pay at the same rate when he has to take his living out of the farm
I have no doubt of it
In Knock there are no less than  widows in a population of  largely the result of drownings in consequence of there being no harbours
Well with the present boats they have they cannot go to a distant fishing ground
They have been fishing near the coast all the time I remember but there are banks in the Minch where they could go in the spring and come back with boatloads of fish but they cannot go with the small boats they have
These small boats they have to haul up when they come home and of course six men could not haul the large boats up the beach
I am referring to them alsoo
They stay too near the shore
If they went twenty miles out into the Minch they would get capital fishing but they cannot on account of the kind of boats they have
I think so
Certainly and harbours to enable them to prosecute the fishing
But then the fishing there is not as good as in the Lewis and they have no harbours there also
A Lewis man could live on that croft far better than a Sutherland man if he had the advantages of good harbours
Exactly
Yes  besides they would be the best source of supply for the navy and merchant shipping for our shipbuilding yards and many other industries
Those stalwart fishermen accustomed to the sea from their boyhood you could not have a better class for the purpose
They would not do
You might send them to Canada or Manitoba and they would be just like seafowl out of the sea  they could not live there
They would break their hearts with home sickness before they would be half a year there
I know some of them who went and had to come back
No I cannot speak definitely of that but I know the stories of those who came back are not so rosy hued as some we have listened to
I know some who came back and their stories are very different
Exactly
Yes I quite allow that the proprietor had a very difficult task
A most stringent law that it should never be allowed again
No doubt of that and they would find it in the navy and merchant shipping
They would go to the colonies when they are better educated and they would go to shipbuilding trades as many of them have gone and they would go to the learned professions
Sir James by his schools has sent away a large number of educated young men and they would find an outlet here and there I have no doubt
There are some of them in the navy
I cannot tell you the number I know some who are now retired on a pension in Stornoway
One is a cousin of my own who was in the Crimean war and in the Baltic and who is now at home after having served his twentytwo or twentyfour years
No it has been going on for the last twenty years
They used to go to Greenock for drill but they are now drilled in Stornoway
There is a large proportion of the male population in the Lewis that have been trained in the naval reserve
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes that is quite true
That is so
I took part in it but it was with very considerable regret
Certainly not
Yes
No
Yes
Yes that is my opinion
Exactly
No I have not made it out for the whole of the Lewis
I have been guided mostly by my experience in my youth at home and the part I knew best
Yes but I am referring to the kind of small sheep we have in the Lewis and we must remember they are very different from the large class of Highland cattle and the best stock of blackfaced sheep  otherwise I might have modified my calculation
I only expressed it as my opinion
I have not entered into niceties of calculation
Yes
As the last sitting of the Royal Commission in the Long Island took place at Tarbert on the th June I have not had an opportunity of contradieting sooner the false statements made by J
MLeod the Ardhasing delegate regarding my father the late Mr Donald Stewart who was one of an ancient and wellknown family viz the Stewarts of Garth Perthshire
He came to Lewis early in the century and with some friends viz the Rev
Dr Downie of Lochalsh Mr Lachlan Mackinnon of Corry and Captain Reid RN took the Park each subscribing an equal share of the capital invested
After giving it up he went to Luskintyre Harris where a lifelong friendship was established between him and Mr MacLeod of Harris who requested him to take the management of the estate
And so unfailing was the friendship that ever existed between them that Mr MacLeod made Luskintyre his home when he visited Harris and before leaving for the West Indieswhere he was appointed to a magistracyboth he and his son were my fathers guests for a considerable time
By looking over the books of the estate it will be seen that instead of my father having ruined the proprietor and crofters as alleged by J
Macleod there were little or no arrears of rent at the time he gave up the management see Ranking and Sale of Harris page  and so satisfied were the trustees and creditors with all he had done that he was appointed judicial factor in  and continued so until the estate was sold in  see Estate Book page 
As a proof of the farms being let at their full value after putting them up to auction at Tarbert in  see Estate Book of that date page  there was not a bid for any of them with the exception of the forest of Harris held by Mr Macrae for which a little more was offered by a man who was all but penniless
I may also mention that in  that is two years after the estate was purchased by the Earl of Dunmore the late Mr Neil Maclean land surveyor Inverness accompanied by Mr Charles Shaw late sheriff of the Long Island was sent to value the farms and I know there was very little difference if any between my fathers valuation and Mr Macleans see Mr Shaws letter
Afterwards when the farms were out of lease they were advertised with the same results see Mr Shaws letter
It can also be seen in book of ranking and sale and Mr W
Mackenzie WS Edinburgh the late Mr Duncan Shaw who was factor on the estate for four years before my father took the management Mr Robert Brown commissioner for the Duke of Hamilton and Mr John Bowie WS factor for Lord Macdonald depone the estate is let at its full value pages  and  Ranking and Sale of Estate
In regard to the evictions spoken of by J
Macleod they did not take place during my fathers management of the estate
Mr Macleods pecuniary difficulties arose from having to pay heavy annuities to relatives having to borrow large sums of money on the estate to meet family expenditure c c
Also from the great fall in the price of kelp all of which show how irretrievably overwhelmed the estate was in debt as shown by  Ranking and Sale of Harris see pages  and  My father took great pleasure in improving the estate in having roads made marches drained and brought under pasture
He also introduced the planting of bent by which large tracts of drift sand were reclaimed and brought under useful pasture for which the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland awarded him a gold medal in  which I have now in my possession
I may add to show how scrupulous my father was that although urged to purchase the estate of Harris by the trustees and other friends who offered to lend him any amount of money he might require he declined to do so
I deny that and I can show it is false
About  I think it was about  when my father took the management of the estate
It was in  that Mr Macrae took the forest and it was in  my father took the management of the estate
I dont know who the factor was but I know Mr Shaw and Mr Brown were the factors before my father
I am connected but not nearly
Yes
Yes and the Sutherland clearances
I concur in his opinion
I have always been a friend of the people
He became judicial factor in  and had been factor for eighteen years before and was so for years afterwards
Yes he had several farms in hand
The only clearances I remember in Harris were those on the west coast and he was not factor at that time
As far as I know he was not
 I endorse every word of Mr Stewarts letter which appeared in your issue of the th
My uncle was not ruined by the factor
I read the evidence of the crofters delegates with great indignation and was delighted to see Mr Stewarts letter
We did not know anything about her till that letter appeared in the papers
Yes
 With reference to the complaint of the Iona crofters regarding their rents being high the small farm of Culburgh was open for offer lately and was taken by Peter Mlnnes one of the Iona crofters at the old rent
Several of the crofters in Iona offered the present rent for the croft vacated by Mlnnes and it was let to Malcolm Cameron who formerly possessed half a croft his half croft being let to Lachlan MLean who held the other half at the old rent
The Duke considers the true value of these crofts is the rent which is offered for them when they became vacant
Yes
I cannot just now
No that was before I had anything to do with the management of the property
I have heard it was raised  that is all I can say
In saying I have heard it was raised in  I mean that I heard it yesterday
I dont know it of my own knowledge and I dont know any reason for raising it then
He does
Yes
I am not aware of any
I think they have been almost all renewed to a certain extent
Yes
All pay the ame rent
It depends very much on the size of the house
I could not give the information
Well the materials form a very large proportion of the expenditure
Lime wood and sometimes straw for thatch
Sometimes built of stone and lime and sometimes pointed with lime
Yes and for the internal partitions and windows and doors
In the manufactured state
Yes and fully more with the straw for the thatching
Yes
They either get it from some of the neighbouring farms or they use spruts
They will not purchase it if they get it on the neighbouring farms
Yes
If it is well thatched with straw it ought to last for six or seven years fully
It is difficult to say
It depends on the size of the house and the coating of straw you put on
To thatch it well requires possibly a ton
 of late more than that before it gets to Iona
Well it does not cost them that
They use spruts or rushes that are grown upon the ground
I mentioned that also
They have it both ways
It is thatched with straw when the proprietor provides the straw but very few of them buy straw from the south for it
I think the tenants give them liberty
I know they do
Yes just a thatched cottage
The building of it
Not onethird
Certainly not
I have got a good black house put up for less than  within the last two years
Yes
I should think so
That is a rough estimate
Yes
Yes there is plenty of fishing if they would take advantage of it
Yes I should think so
Yes
No the whole is not held under leases
The small farm of Culburgh is let on lease and all the crofts are let under an obligation that there will be no revaluation of the crofts for ten years
It is in the minute at the end of the regulations
So far as I recollect there is nothing of that kind
Not so far as I recollect
I know nothing about that I never heard of it before
I never heard of it before yesterday
Wire fencing
There are only two small farms besides the crofters
It was for the benefit of all
Yes
No interest is paid for that class of fencing that has been done during the last two or three years
Yes a gratuitous improvement
Nothing
They have to keep up the existing fences
Generally rickle dykes
Exactly
Yes
I have been in the building myself not very long ago and it is very superior to most of the other cottages that paupers are lodged in in the Ross of Mull
Satisfactory if the paupers will only keep the houses clean
That of course we have no control over
Never
Yes
Your Lordship asked a question about compensation being in the heads of lease
In the more recent heads of lease there is a clauseI cannot give the exact words of it but it is to this effect that the tenant will have no claim for compensation for improvements unless there has been an arrangement made with the proprietor about the execution of these and unless they have been approved
But that does not bar compensation for improvements which have been authorised and agreed upon
I think it is inserted in the Mull regulations
It is one of the more recent clauses
I dont think it is in the Inveraray ones
There will be about eight or ten I fancy
No they dont
There is one man who I see signed that petition
He keeps a beer shop and a grocery shop besides his dwelling house and he has the ordinary patch of land for which his rent is  I think
I daresay it is about that
s and   for the house
I am not prepared to admit that at all
Weil they are convenient for fishing
No some cottages are inland at some distance from the sea
I cannot say as to that I suppose lots of the people buy them
They get a market in the island
Well I think they might do a great deal more than they do
I cannot say
I suppose they do to a certain extent at present
I dont admit the man did that
The Duke looks upon the houses as his
If it is the eighth part of an acre which I am not prepared to say it is let at  an acre
Well I suppose they are the same race of people
No I dont suppose it is anything like the value of the ground in
Perhaps
Yes I have heard of that but it has never been recognised so far as I know by the proprietor
No
I have had no opportunity yet of inquiring as to Mr Murdochs statement
I did and I have ascertained since then that the proprietor has never been a party to any such arrangement
No I did not make any such inquiry as I know it was never authorised or recognised by the proprietor
I am not aware of it
No these things were all before my time
I dont understand what you mean by being revived at any time
No I think Mr Stanford mentioned decidedly not
Well they do it of their own accord
I dont know about that
Exactly if it was ever recognised by the proprietor but so far as I am aware it has never been
As to that I cannot say
Yes
Yes there has been compensation paid to several crofters in Tiree who have left their possessions in recent yearsfor houses
Well I dont recollect any particular case of any improvement done upon crofts that have become vacant of late
Yes it was partly on both
It is a wire fence
Yes
Yes I think he mentioned there was part of their ground fenced
There was a fence put up that they are interested in
I am not prepared to say where it is at present I am not prepared to say it is between their arable ground and their pasture but it is a fence they are interested in
Of the west end crofters
Well there are both
In the west end there is both a fence between the arable land and pasture land of the crofters and between the farm of Culburgh and them
And the arable ground of crofters too
And the pasture ground also of the crofters
Decidedly
Yes
Yes
Of course I make my own valuation besides that
Yes
Yes what they bring when they become vacant
I dont know it follows that Iona is the same as other places
I dont know about these other places
None whatever
There were several crofters offering for MInness croft when it became vacant
Yes
Yes I suppose so
Yes
Yes I think it was
Yes the Duke gave a considerable sum in the way of making up the losses for those years
Not a general abatement
Not a general abatement The Duke said he was quite prepared to consider any case of real hardship and loss which be did and there were large sums given
Yes large sums in the way of compensation for losses
Yes
You can call it an abatement of rent or anything you choose
It was given in the way of compensation for losses
I have answered you as well as I can
I have answered you and I cannot give any other answer than I have done
There was no geueral abatement of rent given
The Duke ordered me to intimate that he was quite prepared to consider special cases of loss or hardship and considerable sums were given to make up for losses
I cannot give you any other answer than I have done and I think it is plain enough
I decline to answer further
I have given a plain enough answer to the question but I must decline to give any further answer and I appeal to his Lordship
The answer I was directed to give was that the Duke did not intend to give any general abatement of rent but that he was quite prepared to consider cases of especial hardship or loss and he would deal with those cases which he did and considerable sums were given in the way of compensation for losses
Yes
I cannot say of my own knowledge whether those sums given for losses were returned at the time they paid their rents or not
Reduced in what way
For what reason
No
Yes
I dont recollect of any at present with the exception of   that was taken off the Iona crofters recently for the loss of the privilege of peat cutting
Well it is a reduction from the last rent they paid
It is still a reduction of rent
Yes but I may say they had no right to that privilege because the Tiree people had the same privilege and when they gave up peat cutting in the Ross of Mull no compensation was paid to them
No
No I dont think so
No
That is not for land
It was not for land he got the reduction of rent
It was for the seaweed on the shores of Tiree because no other person would give more for it I suppose
That was the real value
I cannot charge my memory
There are several fences
There will be three or four fences altogether
Yes the fences that are put up
There is one fence between the arable land and the grazing land of the crofters of the west end
They applied for that and it is a very useful fence for them
Then there is a march fence between them and the farm of Culburgh
I cannot speak of any period except during the restoration of the ruins when they never worked free
But that is not what is stated in this mornings papers
Yes
I think you made the remark yesterday that people had been deceived and that part of the credit was due to the crofters and not entirely to the Duke but I wish to do away with that impression
There was nothing done in the way of restoring the buildings previously
No
Any old ruin may have fallen down and there may have been some rubbish taken away in that way but nothing otherwise
Not in the way of restoring the ruins
Yes they appear to be so
Not for the crofters
No I did not personally apply 
I had several meetings with Mr Nicol
He asked me to distribute the funds
No not that I am aware of
I am not very sure about some of the cottars
Latterly he asked me to let him know if there was any real destitution among the cottars which I promised to do and possibly I may have written him about that but certainly not of my own accordnot unless I was asked to do so
No I wrote to Lord Colin
He asked me also to let him know
He had been requested in the same way to let the London committee know
There was not
Yes
You asked me about  I did not get 
I did
I was ordered to return  which I did
I dont know anything about Tiree
I dont know anything about that
I can only speak for myself and I may explain that the  was sent to me and  was asked as a favour to distribute it not as the Dukes chamberlain but personally to distribute it as a favour to the  committee
I dont think that is a question for me to answer in the circumstances
That is all right
That is all right
Yes I was factor there and had principal charge of the estate
I dont think that is a question I have any right to answer
I think it is quite foreign to the present matter
I beg to decline
I think Mr FraserMackintosh knows it as well as I do
Then I decline
Yes
Nothing more
It is all in the paper here
It is an extract from a speech delivered by a pensioner who had enlisted in the rd against Hugh Millers pamphlet in  He had the greatest respect for that gentleman but he knew the source from which he got his information
He was an Assynt man who enlisted in the rd
Yes
Yes he was one of the people who enlisted under these engagements at the time
I remember of seeing the man at different times
He was just harrassed out of his country when he was trying to speak of it so much so that on one occasion when he happened to be at Eddrachilles seeing a friend at the time his pension fell due the parish minister who was drawing the pension money returned it back to London
You know what it is when a pensioners money is returned
He is considered a dead man
He was obliged to go to London and represent himself as a living soul before he got his pension and that was done by factors and people in Sutherland
Yes only to show he was a living man before he got his pension
Yes that is the clear opinion
Yes
I remember seeing the man himself at times
He was too much of a man
Yes he gave his speech in Aberdeen and it was never contradicted
Surely if Hugh Miller could have contradicted him he would have done it
He was a living man in those days
Yes
Yes
Lord Mackenzie
Seafields ground
Well I differ from them in some things
I have a few notes
 I was elected a delegate to represent my own district of Braes of Castle Grant and to make a general statement
The holdings in my immediate neighbourhood vary in extent from six to thirty acres and are rented at from   to  They were improved by the present and former occupiers entirely at their own expense unless in one or two instances where a leading drain and a few others were put in by the proprietor
I take the croft which I hold as a specimen
In my grandfathers time seventyfour years ago it was rented at  s d and contained about six acres of arable land with a run of the hill pasture then commonty
In  about thirty acres of birch wood pasture were added and the rent raised to  s
My father then began to improve or rather trench so that at the setting of the last lease sixteen years ago the arable acres were brought up to twenty and  the present rent is  on account of improvements that meant a yearly tax of  s on his own labour
The privileges of the hill were very much curtailedbeing restricted to the keeping of seventyfive sheep
The run of a strip of fir plantation was cut away by the wood manager but let to him at the sum of   from year to year until six years ago when it was raised double which I have  since paid
That is  yearly now and just  more than double what it was during the previous lease
During the first four or five years of the current lease my father turned his attention to the building and slating of dwelling houses and outhouses on which he spent much labour and expense
The proprietor gave the wood in a rough state and  for the slate  would be about the value
On my father complaining that that sum was too little the factor passed him off with the remark You will yet find that you have got enough
We could only infer from that remark that well be charged on our own industry as usual
We were justified in making this inference from the fact that he was asked eight or nine years ago to sign an agreement of contract of lease
By so doing he would have discharged all claim for compensation whatever
The buildings if they were in Grantown are said to be worth over  after the buildings were finished or three more acres were trenched and thousands of loads of stones thrown up in dykes
The land is hilly being the slope of the ravine known as Huntly Cave
My father died six years ago at the age of seventy leaving a family of nine sons and two daughters all of whom are alive with the exception of the eldest son who was a surgeon and dentist in Edinburgh where he died of typhus fever twelve years ago at the age of thirty
On the death of my father I took up the lease binding myself to educate and bring up respectably two young brothers and a sister
Owing to insecurity of tenure and the experience of the past I gave over all expensive improvements
If I got compensation I could employ my spare hours trenching and draining the little bits that are yet between me and the rocksthat done I could clothe the very rocks with verdure
At this high elevation  feet crops in bad years cannot ripen
In  we had neither meal nor seed  was little better
This year the crop is still uncut and green
If I had a silo I think I would consign the whole to it
I hope silos may turn out a success
What I would like and most of those with whom I come in contact is a fair rent security of tenure and compensation for unexhausted outlay
Some say go back to the rents of the previous lease and give us back our hill privileges
The crofts away from the foot of the hill are surrounded by plantations enclofeed and are thereby put on the same footing as a low country farm with which there is no comparison
The cattle on such crofts are compelled to pick on the same bare leas from morning till night
When I see starving cows the mothers of the creatures that the rent depends on looking through the fence in a very thoughtful mood at the conserved grass lying rotting I am grieved and angry
To show how much we are at the mercy of landlords and factors Ill enumerate a few cases of dispossession of crofts or farms
The Aitendow grazings contain two farms each of which maintained large and respectable families and were made up of the hill pasture taken from the Braes crofters together with the said farms sixteen years ago
The combined rent of the two places was  s
The grazings are  William Paterson was eightythree years of age when dispossessed
He brought up a family of nine
The youngest son then thirtytwo wished to take the place in company with another man MDonald who was seventy years of age with a growing family of eight but got no chance
Both were good men and the present tenant was not the favoured one
Another at or about the same time the late Mr John Grant of Lagg was dispossessed for no other cause than his being not only a liberal but a leader and teacher of the people
Such is freedom
So we exercise our little brief authority
Still another was the previous tenant of Auchosnich turned off without meliorations but recovered them by law
I could tell of many others within a radius of three miles but I think we have enough to show what need there is for our country to interfere between the people and their extortioners
We feel insecure depressed and cannot assert our independence
We have none
Set us free and do not let us be for ever the subjects of subjects
I have not been led by any one or from any other motive than the good of my class and country
I detest and abhor all class laws and privileges and would like to see them wiped off the statute book
I have here a list of farms that now contain two or three holdings
Those sixtyseven holdings which presumably at one time supported sixtyseven families are now in the hands of twentysix families
That is just in my neighbourhood in the parish of Cromdale
It is the Grantown Supplement published weekly in Grantown
I find there has been a decrease in the parish of Inverallan of ninetyfive and an increase of fiftytwo or a total decrease of fortythree
In ten years from  Total population  in   in  decrease  Decrease since   Cromdale and Advie decrease since   since   Duthil population in   decrease since   I think I heard Mr Bruce say he did not know of an agreement of lease or set between the proprietor and the tenant
I have got a copy here
That is a copy of the agreement between Lord Seafields tenants and himself
It is a written document
By signing this agreement our claim to meliorations is destroyed
In  I think
This is a copy
The article is to the effect that whereas by the leases held by the tenants in Strathspey dated October   the tenants were entitled to certain meliorations for houses and land and the said farms of Strathspey having been let at rents which imply a discharge of all such claims and the rents of the subjects hereby let having been adjusted on this principle the said farmer hereby discharges all claims for meliorations on account of the houses and land occupied by him and all enclosures
No
There are no others
That is my complaint
Well I think that the rents were high enough
Yes
No
Yes
The short statement that I have  now the honour of laying before you is drawn out in the belief that it contains the opinions of the great majority of the people on whose behalf I have the honour of  appearing as a delegate from Strathspey
Our chief wants are  fair rents   security of tenure   compensation for improvements   the addition of pasture to our arable lands and   Government or mutual valuators for land
The valuator is appointed by the proprietor and he goes over the ground and sends in his report
A professional man
If he has meliorations to get there is a certain reduction made
In the case I specially referred toI mean for houses built by the tenant
I am not aware
He is charged the value of it as put upon it by the valuator
Quite so
No I am not aware of any proprietor doing that
Yes I believe he would get more in some cases but the reason is this that when a man gets into a place his credit is established and whether he is able to pay rent or not he is in such a position that he will get credit in the nearest town or village and can go on for a few years
There is
There are various instancesa great rnany instances in Strathspey of grazings that have been withdrawn and substituted by planting
What I understand by a townshipwe have not got a township down therebut I am referring to the forest of Abernethy
It is not long since almost all the tenants in Abernethy had a share in the hill now used as a deer forest
I will give a case in point
The nearest farm to this place is down at Aviemore
The people there I think had their right in common to the ground all behind their several lots or crofts down in that district and now there is a wire fence running straight at the back of their places and they are precluded from going in which in my opinion makes these small holdings a very poor concern for them
Yes
None to my knowledge
Well the planting of wood in Strathspey has been gone into very extensively within the last thirty years and the consequence is that people have been deprived of the grazings that have been attached to their several places
I dont think they are confined to any common in particular or any place
It was general all over the district
Well it has given them a little work certainly in the immediate neighbourhood where they are carried on
As far as I understand they have been made by the proprietor and the people of the country
I think so to a great extent
Yes quite so
Yes so far as regards the house
No I went on the principle of use and wont so far as regards the land
It was detached from the ground I bought for the house
There is about half a Scotch acre attached to every property in Grantown
This was detached
Yes
All the tenementers in Grantown with few exceptions have a piece of land consisting of four or six acres
These have been attached to their places for a great many years
The custom is that if a man buys a house from another he goes and gets the proprietors consent to have the land and that is very often attached to the value of the land as in this case
It is a verbal understanding from year to year
When I say Aviemore I mean the district for several miles down there
I cannot speak with certainty on that point but there is a belief that people pay as much for the land without the pasture as they did when they had it
Only three
Yes
Yes there were a good number of people there
For twenty years
A good deal
So far as I can think it was hill pasture used by the tenants in some districts at any rate
Yes
Yes
I have been told that the number of sheep on Abernethy at one time was some say 
Yes
A very good authority told me that  would cover all the sheep that are in stock there
In the summer they grazed them in the forest here and on the hills and in the winter they wintered them on their own lands
Yes
No
I would be safe in saying that threefourths of thern are below 
Never
Yes
Very well known
I am not aware any reduction was made
Much larger
I think I embrace them generally here
They blame the proprietors for coming down from Badenoch with their sheep the like of Sir John Ramsden coming down and taking the grazings and of course it has the effect of putting up the price on the crofters and others
They complain that the like of Sir John Ramsden comes down and takes grazings from Lord Seafield and of course that puts up the rents on the crofters
No I mean so far as taking the grazings from Lord Seafield is concernedthe wood grazings
That is the interference which the people complain of
I have a note here saying that Sir John Ramsden rents several thousand acres of pasture at one time in the hands of the crofters
These lands are situated at Tom Varich on Lynemore belonging to Lord Seafield
That is what they represented to me as a hardship
No I have not
Very likely
The grievance so far as I can understand from the crofters is that he took it from the proprietor
If he took it from themselves very likely the rents would be increased
Yes waste to the farmers and to the crofters
I cannot be certainabout a dozen or two
The meeting was got up in a very hurried way
By public bills circulated through the country
I cannot tell
I was blamed for it myself but I am in a position to affirm that such is not the case
The first intimation I got of the meeting was when a man came and asked me whether he could get the use of the public hall for the meeting
I spoke about the matter and he would not tell me who was paying the expenses of getting the matter set agoing
I said if there was a public meeting I should certainly be present and I have been asked by a great number of people who did not attend the meeting to represent them at Kingussie
A printed handbill was handed into my house
I cannot tell you
It was given to the servant I suppose
I found it in my lobby in the morning
No I knew it was coming
I knew the party who applied for the hall was sending out the bills
Considering the short notice I considered it a very fair representation from all quarters
I should say it would be nearer twentyfour
I tried to take a note of them after I went home and I have fifteen names on the paper and there were a great many more than these besides the people in and around the immediate vicinity of Grantown whom I did not put down
Yes
I suppose  or  including crofters
No there were more than fifteen
I made up this list after I went home and I know I am correct in saying there were more present than I put down
In the meantime
No we came to an understanding that we would not confine ourselves to the people in that meeting and elected them without asking their consent simply because they were not present
We knewat least some of the parties knewthe sympathies of some of those who were elected
I am not prepared to say
Not by me
I am not prepared to say that
No I cannot say I am not able to answer that question
Yes
I said some people told me it would graze  and I put it down to be within the mark
I am putting this down on the estimate of a party who was very likely to be near the truth
Well I am not very certain about it
I have not got a list of the delegates
I have two statements
The first is a short one connected with the statement by Sir George Grant and the other is a longer one connected with the subject of club farms
It is compared with the acreage
I think there only two Protestants upon the estate apart from some of the officials
I have never heard of another case
Yes
I think so
Certainly
Yes with more than average regularity
Yes
I am not much of a sportsman but that is my opinion
I have never heard of a single complaint
Yes I have never heard of a single complaint
Sometimes they are not able
I did not say they were always able to do it
We never take in a stranger
They have to pay their share of the sheep stock but where they get the money to do it I dont know
No when a croft is out of lease as a rule the adjoining tenant is only too glad to get it
They are
No there is just one lease
It is a minute of agreement containing a schedule with the names of all the tenants and in the body of the lease it is stated that the managers are responsible to the proprietor for the rent
I should think so
I cannot tell you
The rents are always paid in a slump sum
The managers come to me with a cheque on the day
The entire control
I should think not
I dont know very much about it
I am not a practical sheep farmer so I should not like to say very much about it but I have asked the managers themselves and they tell me that in the hands of one man or so greater returns would be got from the farms
Yes
I dont think there is very much religious feeling in it
They would not care about taking in a Protestant but I dont think the religious feeling operates very greatly
I just know one Protestant in Inveroy
They are just called The Mackintosh estates
Yes
That is so
Seventy or eighty I think
One hundred and seventy
I am wrong
There are about eighty in Lochaber and probably ten more altogether
There are fully ninety under 
Yes
The great majority reside on these three club farms of which I have spoken
There is another little community at the head of Strath Dearn where there are nine or ten crofters
Those Lochaber ones hold under lease
The tenants at the head of Strath Dearn have never got a lease
It is tacit relocation
There has been never a lease since the old one expired
No a good many of them have not written leases
To hold under leases
These leases are not always extended
Usually there is a missive and acceptance
Then the majority hold under leases
The rule of the estate is so
If you include simple letters there are not
Yes I hold they are
No
If I am not mistaken it was about 

Well before my time in the time of some of my predecessors there was a very large expenditure in erecting shooting lodges and improving the property generally
But at that time there was a large increase in the rental of farms
Yes
I should think at least  of it is an addition of sporting rents or the increase of the former sporting rents
Yes
There has been very little increase in my time
Any increase there has been in my time has been pretty evenly spread over the property
Small and large
There are two sheep farms out of lease at the present time
Yes
We have not found a tenant
Yes
At a considerable reduction of rent
We were offered  for a farm which formerly let at 
There were other reasons which entered into the matter
Well there are only the two
In the one case as I said there were other considerations that entered and the other farm we got no offer for at all
None at all
It was a purely personal reason
One of them is going to form part of a forest
The smaller one
 It could be added to a very large extent of land to form part of a forest
At the head of Strath Dearn there is a large extent of land extending to about  acres mostly occupied as summer grazings
Another part of that is this farm which I have referred to and it is now out of lease and the remainder is occupied by these nine tenants whom I have referred to
They occupy about  acres and they are not to be disturbed in any way
The rest of the land consists of summer grazings the rent of which has within the last year or two fallen from  to  In these circumstances and the land being well adapted for forest it is intended to form part into a forest
Sheep farmers in the low country sent their sheep up there in summer
No
Nothing whatever
They are left exactly as they were
Well the grazing although very good is very high
The sheep cannot remain there for a very long time I believe and the tenants refused to continue their holdings except at this great reduction of rent and in fact they did not thank us for giving it to them at the reduction
They would just as soon give it up
Close upon  acres
Yes
As soon as formed
Not to the slightest extent
I presume there will be a lodge of some kind erected
There is a small lodge on the ground at present
There will certainly be a shooting lodge of some kind
Yes let as a separate subject
It is very far out of the way but there is an excellent site for making a good lodge
Yes very pretty
Yes in fact some years ago when we thought of afforesting it we were offered a rent of  if a suitable lodge were put up
Even supposing we could get  for the farm which we could not that would give us 
To that  I must add  which we at present get
Yes
Yes say 
That depends very much on the size of the lodge
It would cost  for a new house but there is one there already and it would not cost so much
However say 
I trust it may
There might be about seventyeight acres
There would be a foresters house and the keepers will probably live upon this farm
No not necessarily
A sacrifice to nobody
Yes
No
Not a soul
There is one gentleman who will be disturbedone of the former witnesses who said he usually grazed his stock upon this land
Certainly not
Yes
They paid their accounts by bills and took credit instead of paying cash and the interest was added to these accounts
That I cannot tell
I dont believe they were in poor circumstances because the poorest township of all has not got into debt
These two that got into debt were the two richest townships
No
I believe that to a certain extent they went in for greater luxury and extravagance
Yes
No I dont say that
They come down to the wool market here
They usually get very good prices
I cannot say he is not
Very much about the same perhaps a little below the price
They sold them last year just a little below the prices that others were getting for blackfaced lambs of the same kind
I say they do complain and that is one of the drawbacks that the managers dont manage well and that they dont pull well together
No
Yes undoubtedly
They were not getting such profits as they formerly did
They themselves say the sheep stock was giving a very small return indeed
Some years when sheep and wool were high they must have got large returns and probably got into the habit of spending these returns
They have increased very much lately
That is what we actually get for it
The farmers I mentioned really dont care about keeping on these summer sheilings unless they can get them for nothing at all
It is quite correct
Yes
I suppose they think so at the time but they may discover afterwards that they have made a mistake
There is a natural jealousy sometimes
Yes and it has always been frequented by red deer
Yes
Entirely
That is the only way to make anything out of this enormous tract of land
It has come to a crisis now
On the estate of Mr Macpherson of Belleville
No
I did not prepare a statement
Yes
From the township of Strone
We had not a special meeting
Because there was no other one that would come to speak
They were afraid or something of that sort
I came as the representative of a few of them not the whole of them because we had not a special meeting but I came to represent a few of them
Yes
Yes
That we cannot live in the placethat the place is too dear for us to live in
The place is put out to carry so many sheep and so many cattle and the place will not keep that number of sheep or cattle
Yes it is a township
There are eleven holdings
Yes it has a common pasture and we are in common with two large sheep farms and they get the better of us there
Yes
Yes
Yes they ought to go all together by rights but we wish that ours should be separated and that we should be fenced from the big farmers
No we did not ask for a fence
Undoubtedly they would but in the way we are just now it is taking the last thing out
I got a lease last year upon condition that I would build a house and steading upon the ground
I have not got that lease
They charged me    s and I think that an enormous price to pay for a lease
No the only one who has a lease is myself
The croft I have is between myself and my brother and there are eighteen acres of it and the rest have from seven to nine acres
Of arable land
It has been done this year by the proprietor
He has divided it
A wire fence
Sheep
There are  sheep put out for the whole of our township
One hundred and ten if he had nine acres
Four cows and one stirk
One horse
 s
It has been deprived of the low pasture and that is what makes us suffer altogether
It has been planted all except our arable ground
Yes
No they were not but they were put up at that time
The whole township was put up  at that time
Either seven or eight years
It was undoubtedly
We got a small thing on the other side of the Spey but the water is between us and it does us very little good
No for feeding the cows
It is very bad for them to cross the water
They lose more by going over there than they gain by it and they cannot get there but very seldom
There is no bridge at all
No
They keep the pasture
Yes undoubtedly it is of some value
There is another thing
We are taxed for a road and we dont get anything done in our township for the road
Our neighbours in Glen Banchor get their road repaired every year and there are only two or three townships there but in our township there is nothing done at all
It was repaired for four or five years at the time Mr Macpherson of the British Linen Bank was taking sheep from our fank and every time he was there the road was repaired but since then there has been no word of it
Yes and that there is no feeding for the stock we have on the ground and that we dont want to be iu common with the big farmers
One is in the proprietors own hands and the other is Glen Banchor now in the possession of a large farmer
One thousand sheep
Eight hundred
A thousand sheep but there is another township which is in common too and there are about  in that township
Yes or very near it
The other farms have very low ground
They have it fenced and our sheep when they are in common with them are not fenced and their sheep will come into our ground at this time of the year when they dont get into their own ground
They have good arable ground when they come into it and plenty of meat and when our sheep come into it there is nothing
It is fenced between the arable land and the low pasture ground
There is ground put out which is not in common for use in the latter end of the year and that ground is not fenced
Yes it would give us what we want j and to value our ground for what stock it would keep and to pay for them
I dont mean to say that because I dont know whether we are or not but I mean to say there are a good many more sheep in common than are able to live upon it and then our sheep have not feeding in the winter time the same as the others have and it is from that we suffer most
Yes
Yes he is
He is very easy to speak to
Because we think it is useless
Yes
Yes
Mr Macarthur
In Glen Banchor they may go there but there are enough already
Plenty room there
Yes
Yes they have been on the estate for generations past
Yes they do expect that but they dont think it is the case
Of course this present proprietor is very good to his tenants
He gives them almost everything that is wanted
If it were stated right to him what was wanted I dont think but what he would give it
Yes I think he has heard it today
Four of them
I was not personally speaking to the other seven
We have all the same tale in all our gatherings how we are used and how our sheep are in a mesh and next year we shall be much worse as The Mackintosh of Mackintosh is to make a forest on the other side of the hill where our sheep go just now and it is in every gathering where two or three meet together  What is to become of our sheep if that is made a forest of whether they are to be driven further away or whether he is to fence it
Yes
Yes
I dont think they have
If we got the fencing the same as the other farms have I think it would require to be three miles if we got our half hill fenced the same as the other farms have it but there are about twenty crofters on the length of three miles for there is another township of crofters and I dont think there is any delegate to speak for them here
Of course we crofters will agree better in common than we do with the large farmers
They are obliged to buy in stuff for winter and as to the feeding they have in the summer time it will be half the year because there is not proper feeding in the summer time
It was the reason I got a lease that I took in hand to build a slated house and the proprietor was to supply me with all the materials but I was to pay for the carting of the material myself
That was the reason why I got a lease or why I shall get it if I pay  s for it
They are mostly the old black houses
Well I dont consider anything fair till we would have just a proper grazing for our beasts
The last rise that was put on the place was   on every  But there were one hundred more sheep put upon our township at that time and all the rest were added to greatly and ever since that time every one has enough to do to eke out a living
I should think that would be quite sufficient
I think if onethird of all the sheep on the hill were put off and onethird of the cattle and the rent reduced greatly we could live
About nine or ten years ago
 for every 
I have that number
For instance I bought in fiftythree young wedder hogs last Whitsunday and all I was able to send away this year was forty
All the rest died and I thought it was the want of feeding that was the cause of it
No the way we are just now it is impossible for us to make a good living
Yes there are plenty for us but to pay the rent and everything that follows it we are not able to pay our way
Yes I mean to say I am losing money
Yes I think so
Some of them are more lucky than others in getting jobs out by
No I have no statement
I am only here to answer questions
I first came twenty years agoin
Yes considerable
My first inducement was to obtain a deer forest but I wished in addition to that to become possessed of a large extent of wild land which would give me the opportunity of planting and draining and improving it according to my own wishes
Yes the possession of Ardverikie was very complicated owing to a very long lease and also some  other land which ran into it very much which was entailed land and in order to acquire the estate which I now have I was obliged to buy other lands to exchange for the entailed lands
In consequence of that I had to make myself very minutely acquainted with the circumstances much more so than if I could have bought the land straight off
Much more closely
The acreage I have round Ardverikie is  acres and Alvie which is a detached property  in Invernessshire altogether
The  acres round Ardverikie cost  and the  at Alvie cost  making  as the original purchase price
Yes the whole estate was a forest
It was entirely clear
There were no sheep upon it and no people whatever except the foresters in charge of the forest and Ardverikie you may say was quite deserted
There was only one old woman to take care of the house and one forester to take care of the outbuildings
The remains that exist are chiefly remains of summer sheilings merely but there are in one or two places traces of old cultivation which must have taken placeat some very distant time
No great extent
I may say I have taken a good deal of trouble to ascertain the history of them if I could and as to when they were thrown out of cultivation but I have been quite unable to do so
There seems to be no tradition in the country as to when they were cultivated
The only case where I have been able to trace any sort of trustworthy tradition was this that my late head forester who died this year at eightyfour years of age and had lived in the country all his life told me that when he was a young man he remembered an old woman whose father was understood to have once had a small farm inside what is now the forest
Yes very high above the sea indeed
The water level of Loch Laggan is  feet according to the Ordnance survey
I had the curiosity to count them the other day and there are nine peaks over  feet
Fully half of the forest is above  feet above the sea
A considerable part of it is above  feet
There is hardly any of it that is lower than  feet above the sea
Yes part drains to the west by the Spean another part drains to the east by the Spey and another drains to the southeast by the Tay
Yes there is a hill just behind Loch Ericht lodge from which the water drains into three seas
Yes it ran in with a narrow sort of tongue into the forest and consequently made a march which it was very difficult indeed to keep
Yes I took the high ground of Strathmashie about  acres off the low ground and added that to the forest
Yes that is all the addition I have made
Yes I have taken off a large extent for this purpose
Altogether I must have taken off  acres for the home farm and plantations
Yes I was able to make an arrangement by which he was undisturbed
It happened at the same time with the expiry of the lease of Strathmashie that the lease of the adjoining farm of Dalchully expired also
The tenant of Dalchully was an absentee
In fact I never saw him and never heard of his being in the country
When his lease expired he made no communication to me
He did not ask me for any renewal and the farm consequently fell into my hands
I gave that and the low ground of Strathmashie to the tenant from whom I had taken the  acres of hill ground and he remained as my tenant until his death
Yes
At Ardverikie I have planted over  acres on which I have planted  trees and at Alvie I have planted nearly  acres with  trees making altogether  acres planted with  trees and that I am going on with as quickly as the seasons will permit
By no means
My nursery is calculated to enable me if the weather allows it to plant  trees yearly for the future
I am afraid I cannot give you the cost of the plantations alone
I can give it to you with the other expenditure generally
As to fencing at Ardverikie I have put up more than  miles of my own internal fences and I have joined with neighbouring proprietors in putting up more than  miles of march fence
At Alvie I have put up  miles of internal fencing and joined with other proprietors in putting up about  miles of march fence
I have done a good deal of draining although I have a very great deal more still to do
I see I have made  chains which is roughly speaking  miles of open drains
During the same time I have made over  miles of carriage road and more than  miles of pony tracks and walks without counting several miles which I have made at Alvie of similar walks
During the same time without counting my own house at Ardverikie or the shooting lodges which I have built or enlarged I have built eighteen new houses and put into repair thirteen old houses
I have built two complete new sets of farm buildings besides making considerable additions to three other sets of farm buildings
I dont include in these the ordinary estate repairs
The whole outlay I have made exclusive of the cost of purchase during the twelve years has been  or an average of rather more than  a year spent in the country
I employ all the country people I can get
A good many of the road makers come from the west coastprincipally from the island of Lewis
I dont think many Skye men come but a good many come from Lewis
Yes
Of course these roads are away from any houses generally speaking and I have to build a barrack near the work at which they live during the summer months when it is going on
All my estate servants are
All the foresters are men of this country
In every sense except my own household servants who travel about with me
I took on all the foresters
I took them all on twelve years ago when I came into the forest and I have nearly all of them now
If I may be allowed to make a digression I should like to say this because I have seen in this inquiry it has often been stated that employment as a forester or a gillie is a demoralising employment and that men become unfit for other work
As far as my own experience goes I would ask permission to contradict that altogether and I may say I have very good means of comparing the people here with those in the south because I have a great many people employed on my estate in England and I can compare the two and I must say that of all the people of the labouring class that I have ever employed I know none whom I have found more thoroughly trustworthy than the foresters I have had in this country
I think the state of the forest is a proof of that
When I entered upon it more than twelve years ago there were seven foresters employed
Five of these are still in my service
One of them emigrated ten years ago and I filled his place by promoting his brother who was at that time one of my gillies and he is still in my service as forester
In all those twelve years among all the men I have only had one single instance where I had to discharge a man for misconduct and that misconduct did not consist of any unfaithfulness in the discharge of his duties
I use the word forester as a man simply employed in a deer forest as distinct from a woodman and as distinct from a grouse keeper and I may add that my own gillies are really among the best of the workmen
I employ them not merely for the time when they are gillies but at my other work all the year round
They go on from year to year and there are none of my workmen that I value more
I believe they are
I should say they are entirely from that class
He was a man for whom everybody in the country I should think had the highest respect
I can only speak of him as one of the most valued friends I ever had in the world
He died this year eightyfour years old and he has been a very great loss to me
During his whole life
He began life as a foxhunter in the parish of Laggan
When the Duke of Abercorn made the forest of Ardverikie he put him at the head of it and he remained there under the Duke of Abercorn under Lord Henry Bentinck and under me up to the day of his death
The population of the parish of Laggan according to the census has certainly not increased it has diminished
I have no means of comparing the population of my own estate now with what it was ten years ago
I have no means of subdividing the old returns for the parish but I think I have other evidence which must show that the population on my estate has increased
First of all I had to build a number of new houses and every one of these new houses is fully occupied and if I had more I could fill them very well
I not only built new houses but I repaired any old ones capable of being repaired
Then in addition to that it has lately been found necessary to build a new board school close to my home farm where no school had ever been beforea school which is attended by thirty children
Certainly twenty of them are the children of labourers and persons employed on my own estate
Then there is another school held now in an old inn at Garvamorea much less populous part of the parishwhich is attended by fifteen children and all come from my estate
Then the parish school at Gargask I believe is almost entirely filled by children from my own estate
I say almost entirely for this reason that Cluny has a school of his own for the children on his estate which is only two miles from this school on my estate
I cannot myself see any other means of employing the ground that would be so valuable or so generally beneficial to the district certainly
Yes it has increased very considerably
It is a remarkable point connected with this that the increase of the rental has arisen almost altogether from the increase in the value of the forests and shootings very little from the increase in the rental of agricultural land
I have compared the last year in the valuation roll with the valuation roll of  which was the last year before I became possessed of the place
In  it was  in  it was  showing an increase of 
I ought to say that from that increase I should take  which is merely a nominal increase on my own estate owing to the farms in my hands having been returned at higher than their true market value and this is to be corrected in the forthcoming roll  so that the real bona fide increase in the thirteen years is not  but  Of that   is due to forests and shootings and only  is due to land
Yes
The case of the parish of Alvie where I am also interested is found to be still more striking
There the increase in the last thirteen years has been about  per cent namely from  in  to  in  The increase on shootiugs and fishings is  while the increase on land rents is only 
A certain amount is consumed in my own household but every bit not consumed in my own household is given away
The great bulk of it is given away in the country
Of course I send a certain amount to friends in Scotland and friends in England but that is a drop in the ocean
The great bulk is distributed among my neighbours in the parish
Among the work people and the poor people
Yes
Yes
I advertised them iu every paper I could think of
Yes I got an offer and accepted the offer but when it came to the point the man declared off
Yes
I was so anxious not to have the farm thrown on my own hands that I put it into my law advisers hands to see whether the man who was a man of considerable capital could not be compelled to adhere to the offer he had made
They have fallen upon my hands most unwillingly
They still remain in my own hands
No person unless you can call it so in the case of  acres when I gave the man an adjoining farm in return for what I took from him
Yes I have practically rebuilt the old bridge at Garvamore which had become impassable and now the authorities have accepted it
Yes these are the only tenants I think who would come under the definition of crofters on the whole estate
Yes
Yes a number of them are so and there is a chapel close by
I have enclosed and planted it myself
When I obtained the property there were simply the bare walls without anything round them no enclosure of any sort
I have
No it is not what you would call a club farm that is to say the tenants have no common stock
Each man has his own stock
I should myself think it would be very much better for them to have a common stock and shepherds acting jointly for all of them and I may say that under their leases these Crathie tenants are bound to come under that system and I should have been very glad to put them under that system but I found there was so much unwillingness on their part to agree to it that I did not press the matter
They have not fallen out because I have renewed them
Yes they expired and I have renewed them for another term
No I renewed the leases at the same rents and on the same conditions
I have raised the rents of the shooting tenants but I have not raised the rent of any agricultural tenant I found there
Where necessary they are
My forests are peculiarly situated
There is a large lake at the north and another at the south so I have twenty miles of water boundary
Then the eastern end of it abuts upon agricultural and pastoral land and is all fenced from the one lake to the other
On the west end it abuts on the property of two large proprietors part of which ground is also cleared for deer
At that west end there is no fence but I have offered to the proprietor whose ground is under sheep to join him in putting up a march fence if he wishes it
If you ask me the question I should carry it much farther
I should say that not only all forests should be fenced but wherever one owner of land wishes to have a march fences put up the adjoining owner ought to be bound to bear his share and put up a fence whether it is forest or sheep ground
None whatever
Yes I have taken very great pains in doing that
Yes
I have employed trappers and when I was told I would get a better trapper from England I imported him and in all my shooting leases I reserve to myself the power of keeping down hares and rabbits of my own authority without permission from the shooting tenant
I did so directly the Act of  passed
No certainly I cannot conceive that in any possible way I have injured any person whatever though I hope it has done much good by putting a great deal of money into the pockets of the people here
Yes very decidedly
The decrease of pauperism has been considerably more than the decrease of the population
I am told that is so and the proof that has been given to me is that people are now able to buy a more expensive sort of food and more of it than they could do before this expenditure was going on
Very rarely indeed
Yes
Yes I must say it has been to me a great interest and I find it is an interest that grows greater and greater every year
 Whatever you do dont inflict any injury upon these poor people
Let us make our improvements without in any way affecting them and if possible give them a more permanent tenure than they had before  and in consequence of his representation I gave them those eleven years leases see Appendix A
LXXVIII
I have no means of comparing the population on my estate since I became proprietor as distinguished from the parish
No my opinion is that they must have increased because I certainly have built a number of houses which did not exist before and every one of those houses is fully occupied
I am afraid I have not got that
I could easily ascertain it but I cannot state it just now
Yes I can state that
It is in the return I have made out for the Commission
Eight crofters
Yes they have hill pasture above their arable land
I think it is stated there that their proportion of the common grazing would work out to be acres
That is their proportion of the grazing plus their arable land and the rent they pay is  s if I remember right
Yes during the thirty years but I have only possessed it twelve years
There have been no alterations since I became the owner
Yes I think they are in very comfortable circumstances
Well I employ their sons as my workmen and I hire a good many of their horses
Of course that must be an advantage to them but whether or not they could live without it I cannot say
I cannot say they are good
They are about the average
Thatched houses
I dont know that
They are just in the state they were when I got the property
I can show the number employed at weekly wages
Here is the return of those on day labour paid monthly from the st January  to  That is merely the day labourers employed on estate improvements
It does not take in any of the foresters or gamekeepers or carters or any of the people we permanently employ and it does not take in anybody who is working on contract
Certainly a very great number more
Well I should say there are perhaps rather more required but not many more required necessarily only I live there because the inducement to me to live there is the deer forest and when I live there I carry on all those improvements on the estate while the sheep farmer of course would limit his expenditure to the narrowest possible amount
All the foresters have and the keepers have
They have generally two cows each
The foresters are
The labourers are employed as long as the weather will allow
There are not sufficient men for these works of mineroad making and so on
I build barracks for them wherever the work is barracks which I can move about from place to place so as to let them be near their work
Entirely
I have seen it reckoned in that way but I should not lay stress on it myself
No it is all either consumed in my own house or given away
Certainly not in an economic point of view not as a matter of trade but I would think that for the people in the parish of Laggan it is very much better because there might be a great deal of mutton but not a pound of it would be given away
I never think of giving away a pound of mutton though I give the whole produce of the deer forest
I should say it is better for the people of the district
None of it
The highest is the top of Ben Alder which is  feet
There is some sown but I doubt if there is any ripened above  feet
I think it is about  feet
I would put it at between  and  feet
No certainly notso little that it is not appreciable
I believe that was the system
I suppose they would pay a certain rent for it
But the conditions of agriculture are so charged that one can hardly conceive it because that would imply that you did not graze sheep
Of course the sheep and cattle would interfere with each other and it is so much more profitable to graze the ground with sheep than with cattle that we can hardly conceive of the old sheiling system being restored
No doubt blackfaced sheep could be grazed there but very few could be wintered there and there we come to the difficulty
From the sheep farms now in my own hands I have to send away  sheep in the winter
Each sheep I reckon on an average costs me s and there is  a year spent in hiring wintering
Yes there is a certain loss no doubt but if the forests were put back into sheep of course the result of that would be that wintering would be dearer still than they are now and what really limits the quantity of stock you can graze is the difficulty of feeding them in winter
You could no doubt graze a great deal more sheep than you have in summer but they would starve in winter
At some very remote time no doubt it was because I find a great deal of timber in the mosses but those mosses are the very ground which will not now grow any timber at all
No I dont fancy there were any such cuttings
No in fact Lord Abercorn afforested the ground before there were any means of communication with that part of the country which would have made it pay to cut timber and from the date of his afforesting of course nothing could be touched and therefore I may say I came into it as nearly in a state of nature as any piece of ground in Scotland
I am planting every acre I can spare for the purpose
I certainly hope my descendants will reap the profit from it but there is no prospect that it will in my lifetime be a source of profit
Wherever the ground will grow larch I plant larch
Not as yet
I have only been planting for twelve years
Undoubtedly to a very much larger number
Yes a great deal
Making and repairing fences
I am sorry I have not come to the thinning yet but in a few years it will begin and no doubt it will be a very great work
I have begun thinning at Alvie but there I began planting a year or two earlier
At Ardverikie I have nothing to thin as yet
Certainly I do
The most expensive deer fences I have put up have cost about s per yard six feet high with ten wires and iron standards
Where I can I employ wooden standards the cost is very much less
With wooden posts certainly a five feet deer fence
Certainly in my opinion it ought to be equally divided between the two
I see no reason for departing from the ordinary rule of dividing it equally between the two
I think the benefit would certainly be as great to the owner of the sheep as to the owner of the deer forest
My own opinion is that we must be guided in that entirely by the circumstances of each case
Some marches between two sheep farms it is perfectly unnecessary to fence but some marches between tenants on the contrary it is necessary to fence just as much as between the deer forest and the sheep farm
Admitting that I am bound to say that in some cases sheep will go from the higher ground on to the lower and at certain times of the year they would always be nearest to the direction in which they are wintering
If the wintering is to the east and two farms are divided by a march east and west the sheep on the farm most to the west would about this time of the year encroach in hundreds upon the farm to the east of them because they would be trying to get down to their wintering and those to the east would not encroach at all on the farm to the west
I think it depends on the special circumstances of each farm
I think the fair plan is what I believe to be now the lawthat it should be equally divided
May I add one qualification  If the owner of a deer forest required that to keep in his deer a higher fence should be put up than is necessary for sheep then I should say he ought to pay the extra cost which he causes but not in the case of an ordinary sheep fence
I think those cases would be so infinitesimally few where the forest borders upon arable groundwhich is generally the lowest part of the ground that you could hardly expect legislation to provide for that
Yes not altogether so high but there is very high ground in those sheep farms as well though they are not so high nor wild nor rough as the forest
I have no intention of doing so
No doubt they might be turned into forest but I dont think at present anybody would do so but if there came to be a very great demand for forests land which is not so well fitted for forest as other land would then probably be turned into forest
Oh yes certainly
Yes
Yes I think they would
I have no intention
Always assuming the supply of forests was not overdone
Always supposing I could get a tenant for them
It is so doubtful that apart from any other considerations I would not undertake it
That consideration would hardly come into play because I should not do it merely as a matter of profit and loss but I should also consider that I had two forests already and did not wish to have another
I dont wish to let a forest
I would rather have the farms under sheep if I could possibly carry them on as sheep farms
No
For instance if I had not a forest of my own at all if I had only these sheep farms and wished a forest for my own use I should be very much inclined to turn some of those sheep farms into forest
I think that owing to the great difficulty of letting land as sheep farms a great deal of land has lately been cleared for deer and the consequence of that is that there is a risk of the supply of deer forests exceeding the demand
The men whom I call foresters are employed all the year round attending to the forest
They have to watch the ground and watch the deer to take care they dont stray over the march
Yes that is their duty
I should define him as a man who goes out and attends upon the grouse shooter and deer stalker
No only for the sporting season
Yes
I take a certain number of my regular workmen and employ them during the season as gillies
If they are not out in the forest they go to work
Yes just like other people
I cannot recollect any other class
Yes
Of course there is an infinite number of miscellaneous people who are employed about the forest because there is generally a large lodge with a number of people with various wants living in it but still that is not special to the forest
They get their employment because there is a forest there but they are not employed on the especial work of the forest
So far as my experience goes I cannot say I have seen any difference
When I first came here I came as Sir George Macpherson Grants tenant under a seven years lease of the forest of Glen Feshie and all I wish to state in reference to the Ardverikie foresters I can say in reference to the foresters I had at Glenfeshie
Of course as regards the gillies my knowledge does not extend far because they were only employed during the time we were in the forest
When we were out of the country not being the proprietor I had no work to give them
None whatever
I have never heard of it except in the case of killing very miserable hinds some of which are really not worth carrying home
I daresay some of those may have been left
Very rare nothing that is worth anybodys while carrying home so far as my experience goes
Yes
I have no statement
I am marching with the forest for a considerable distance and I have been very much aggrieved ever since I came
Seven years
Under a lease
Nineteen years
There is a good deal of pasture but very little arable
I believe about  or  acres cropnot more at all events
I believe it will be upwards of  acres
I keep five in the summer and I keep double in the winter
About
No blackfaced
All blackfaced
No it does not border at any point on the deer forest
Yes
Merely a wire fence
No stone dyke
Partially now but not before I came
No it is not a deer fence but merely a sheep fence
No they do not
My own proprietor is Mr Macpherson of Belleville with whom I have no grievance at all I find him one of the best proprietors
I understand it is Sir George Macpherson Grant
It was
I had no idea that I was joining a deer forest
I did not know
I was never marching with a deer forest in my life before old as I am and I did not know it when I came to Badenoch
I made no inquiry because I was a long distance from it
I believe I was perhaps  miles away
I am a native of Argyllshire and did not know anything about Badenoch when I came to it
Very few
No I do not complain of the aggressions of the deer at all not so much
I complain of the aggressions of the tenant and the landlord
Yes and the landlord
When I came there I understood that my predecessors had bothies erected in the summer season
I only get the benefit of the neighbourhood of the forest in the summer months and I very naturally put my sheep up there when I can get the benefit of it because these high hills are covered with snow during seven months of the year
I put them all up there consequent they cross over to the forest
My predecessors had bothies there and shepherds to keep them back and so had I
I erected an iron bothy to make a permanent thing because I concluded it would see out the termination of my lease for I did not expect to see it out myself
Very well I erected a permanent bothy and my shepherd of course was there the whole season keeping my sheep back as my predecessors did but still they were going over in spite of him
Well the first two years I was very much aggrieved indeed with complaints from the head forester and from the tenant that my sheep were going over
I told them I used every precaution to keep them back but could not and when it is foggy weather for two or three days my sheep will go over in spite of the best shepherd and then when they are putting them back they are disturbing the forest which is a great grievance to the shooting tenant and certainly very injurious to my stock
The second year I was gathering my stock about the end of September for marketing
I wrote to the principal keeper over there that I intended sending my shepherds in on such a day and I hoped they would disturb the forest as little as possible in order to get out my stock for marketing
I have still a farm in Argyllshire and I had occasion to go there to look after it and I left word with my manager but a letter came in my absence prohibiting me going into the forest and saying that legal proceedings would be taken against me if I entered the forest even for my own property
My men did not go on that occasion and consequently I lost about  that year
I was not allowed to get back both ewes and wedders that I should have put away and I calculated I lost  that year
The sheep I did get I sold at the Falkirk October Tryst for s d and I had my ewes sold previously for s
I was prohibited from going in for three weeks
The consequence was I gathered all I could get upon my own ground and sent them to market
At the end of three weeks I asked liberty to get in and got it
But between the time I sold my first lot and the last lot I was short of about  because the market came down
I grant you all that but we cannot do it
For instance I am marching with the same forest a distance of eight or nine miles
Certainly it would I would even be pleased with a sheep fence
Yes it would be a remedy for my grievance that my stock would not trespass into the forest
I do not say but he has but it becomes very expensive for my proprietor even to share the half
He has done a very great deal for me already and if he will do this it will be more than I ever anticipated
Well I do not say but it does but I say myself that the law is onesided very much now in regard to deer forests
How in the name of goodness are deer forests more sacred ground than my land
I do not object to them coming over to my ground and the deer come over in hundreds and they never heard me complain yet about their deer
I never complained yet to my neighbour about his deer coming over
Of course they will not stand and look at the grass
I think so
I say so that it should be put up entirely at the expense of the proprietor of the deer forest because he is getting an equivalent benefit a very great deal more benefit than the grazing proprietor is getting
Besides a considerable portion of this forest that is marching with me was under sheep for two years after I came
There was no reason of complaint between that neighbour and me in the world though there were some sheep going back and forward
We were all neighbourly but now this portion of the farm is added to the forest and is made a sanctuary so that I am the same as if I was beside a house of glass
Not the slightest doubt
There is nothing to keep them out of it
No they are very seldom seen in the arable ground
I have no complaint to make of the arable ground as to the deer nor yet even for the grazing
I make no complaint supposing they are over in hundreds
The only thing I complain of is the grievances I have with the shooting tenant of Gaick forest
Perhaps between himself and his tenant
I think it was in
Not at all
I did not sell my sheep at the Inverness market but I sold them at the Falkirk tryst for s d and for what I took out of Gaick I only got s d at Perth market which was the only market I could send them to after the tryst was over
I lost my market because I was not allowed to enter the forest for them
It looks very like what you say because I should never think of interdicting the tenant of the forest from coming in upon my ground but the proprietor and the tenant of Gaick summoned me to the Court of Session to get interdict against me
Of course they failed fortunately for me and for the whole country
It was not granted
How could their land be more sacred than mine
I could never think of trying to interdict them from coming on to my ground but they tried to interdict me from going on to their ground even after my own property
I dont believe it
I dont know whether I have the right and even if I had it I would not put it in execution
No I certainly would not
Yes
The complaint always comes from the weaker side not from the strong side
The strong side knows the law better than the weak side and can put it in force because he has plenty at his back to do it with
Now I am the weak side and I have a very little at my back to spare although perhaps I am as independent as he is with regard to what I take in hand
I do not want to throw anything away in law
I complained in the first instance that he interdicted me going into the forest and took me to the Court of Session
Then I came to lay my grievance before you as Commissioners
That is the only thing that I have to do
It is immaterial to me how you take it but I know I am very much aggrieved with the deer forest
Yes I mean that
Yes
It would be mo gain to the sheep farm
I believe it would be a greater gain to the forest than to the sheep farm to keep the sheep out of the forest
To avoid disputes entirely
I believe from end to end of the forest it would be seven or eight miles
But let me tell you a few miles of that have been erected within a few years
None in the world because there is seldom any complaint between ordinary farms
Mutual obligation
Yes when the forbidden fruit is on the other side of the fence we are all liable to go to it
I dont know but I would have  or 
I did indeed
I was cited to the Court of Session with the expectation of getting interdict against me
My neighbours were going against me to prohibit me from going into the forest
Besides I was threatened with legal proceedings about which there is a good deal of correspondence between us and all my letters are in the hands of my agents in Edinburgh or I could have brought them here
I was threatened with legal proceedings and two years ago or about twelve months ago I was summoned to the Court of Session to protect myself against an interdict for going into the forest for my own property
Yes now within the last year or two
It answered the purpose well enough as long as it stood but the snow breaks it down and my sheep went round the end of it
There is five or six miles not fenced yet and my sheep go round the end of it and go in at the back of it
I was satisfied with it so far as it was a fence
They were threatened with being poinded over there and on several occasions they have been gathering them down to the bottom of their own valleys
Their men would not let them get back the way they went forward and they had twenty miles to travel before they got into their own hirsel again
I suggested long ago that the fence should be extended and not limited to the few miles it is
But I do not blame my proprietor at all
I tell you he is one of the best of proprietors
I have got a very great deal from him that there was no stipulation at all about
I never walked on it in my life except on one occasion
If they do not keep grass for deer deer will not be there
They must have grass to the point of their horns nearly
Certainly it would
It would be in worse condition under sheep than under deer
I dont believe the deer have done it any harm
I dont believe it
I dont believe it does but I believe that land deteriorates under sheep
I have no great experience I must say about deernone in the world
Yes
I would expect they would go back the same way as they would come forward if there was a sheep fence
No
I do not believe it would keep the deer from entering into my ground because I never made any complaint against them
No it would not
Yes equally the same I believe perhaps not exactly but it would not prevent them going one way or another
No and I would not attempt it
Suppose you put a rifle in my hand I would not think it worth while to go to the railway station down there for one
I believe they do
I cannot see for myself how there is so much bone wool and flesh taken off the same land every year without deteriorating the land and there is nothing put in there to replenish the grass except the droppings of the sheep which are a mere bagatelle
Now there is an extraordinary quantity of flesh bone and wool put off the land yearly and nothing put in to replenish the ground for it
Yes I do
No and that is the reason why I am at a very great deal more expense in wintering them than I was the first years I came in there
A blackfaced stock
It is my experience that they are dearer and I will say another thing
I know that you Lochiel and the like of you spoil us tenants very badly
I dont say you know of i t but you send your managers out scouring the country for winterings
Then if I go for itOh Lochiels manager and Sir John Ramsdens manager and Sir Robert Menzies manager have been here and we will get anything we want and if you dont give that just move away
Let me tell you it will be a good job now for you if you get your farms let
You will appreciate your farmers when you get them
It is not that you take wintering but you take them far too high and raise the wintering upon us down in the country
If your men were keeping them down of course we could easily live
If I could sit upon another persons coattail my word I would make the purse long enough but I am sitting on my own coattail unfortunately
I dont know but I know I can do better than they do
I know that perfectly and can prove it
And you are not singular
There are plenty of the noblemen in the country that I can prove the same thing about and I dont doubt but I have plenty witnesses here that I could bring forward to substantiate my statement
I believe it was but when I got it I tell you honestly it made me shake
It is a thing I am not accustomed to
Yes
I sent it at once to my agent
No I had not to appear
I believe I would have had to appear but it was not granted
It was refused
My agent appeared for me
I understand without ordering a proof
I have been there for twentyfive years
In drapery principally and in grocery and ironmongery and the different things that are kept in large stores
Yes
Yes
I did not come here as a delegate but by invitation of the Commissioners
With the farmers of the strath
There are a good many small farms but I could not say about the size of them
There are a number of farms from thirty to eighty acres in the country round about
Yes
I should say they are better now than they were fifteen years ago and they were getting on very well till about seven years ago but since then they have had very bad years and it has been uphill work
We do a large business outside the strath but I should say it has not improved in Strathspey in that time
I do not suppose there is any
It is very much the same as it was seven years ago
No they have had bad years but if good times were coming again I should say our trade will increase with them
Well the trade is very much the same but they do not pay so well as they did
More bad debts
Yes
Yes
Yes
No
Tweeds principally but we do a good deal in grocery goods also
A great many of them do but they all buy largely in Grantown
I cannot sayI think very much the same
I should say it was increasing
They purchase furnishings and carpets from those stores
I am not aware
Yes l am not aware of their getting tweeds or cloths of any kind from the stores
I should say a beneficial effect
During the two or three months in autumn they leave a great deal of money in the country
I have often heard it said it has but I am not aware it is so and I cannot mention an instance
No
No
They do
In one lodge there are seven or eight gamekeepers employed
I cannot say
I cannot recollect of any just now
Yes but I am not in a position to mention them
I should say so
They would not
There is no feeling against them
For instance in regard to the grouse shootings there is no unkindly feeling that I ever heard
There might be more in the case of deer forests
I am not prepared to mention any particular case
Yes
Yes
No
In Strathspey we have only two I think
Well I think it is sent away in presents by the sportsmen to their friends
Not in the neighbourhood where I am
They give it to the poorer crofters
They use it all
I am not sure
No I have never been in the forests and am not posted up about the way they do
Yes
I think there is only the cattle show
Yes they used to be held at Castle Grant at one time and were very successful but they have not been so successful latterly
Yes and the people turn out very largely
Yes but there is not very much money required
I know they all give cheerfully and at our cattle show they give prizes very handsomely
Well I am not very sure about that
Yes
Yes a great deal
Yes we have had a good deal to do with several forests for ten or fifteen years
No
Yes
Yes a large number
Yes
Well occasionally but there is not very much work in that way I daresay
Yes in many places they do not require paths
Yes
I have not heard of a shooting tenant ever keeping them back from gathering them but I have heard that this year some of the keepers kept them back
I do not know whether it was with the consent of the tenants or not
It would have been this year but for four years back there was no crop
It is in the interest of the masters
They wish to behave as kindly to the natives as is possible
The people however gathered a great many
I am sure that several cartloads have been gathered in the different parts of Strathspey this year
No but I know the gamekeepers do not wish to allow them inside certain parts of the forest
Yes but they would not make very much money out of them
Just on the hill sides always where there is heather and it is only one year in three or four that there is a crop
From the middle of August to the middle of September
No
They have not had good years the last six or seven years but they are certainly a contented class of people and have been all their time looking forward to bad years
There have been instances but I am not prepared to speak of them because I am not a farmer and from a business point of view I cannot speak
No they would not make a complaint to me in a case of that sort
They just speak of the bad years and hope times will improve
Yes a good many years ago
About twelve or fifteen years ago
I cannot answer that
I was not the least interested in farming and cannot answer
No I thought you would only ask questions of me in a business way
Yes I am a native of that district
I have not been there twice in seven years
We have no accounts in Strathnairn
I cannot give any comparison upon that
I do
It is my wish to offer a few remarks in reply to the evidence given at Inverness on Friday last by Mr Colin Chisholmevidence affecting Strath Glass and the management of the Guisachan property during the last thirty years
That evidence I read on Saturday at Guisachan
I could have wished that Mr Colin Chisholm had given me some notice of his intention to attack the management of the Guisachan property
I think he would have shown not only more courtesy towards myself but also a greater desire to place the whole truth before the Royal Commissioners as had he done so I should have been prepared to bring forward witnesses to contradict his statements  for instance Alexander Stewart who was my manager at Guisachan from  to  also Hugh Eraser who has been on the estate for fifty years he is a son of one of the old crofters also two Macdonalds William and Archie sons of an old crofter on the property and I feel quite confident that those men would have borne testimony to the consideration and liberality and kindness shown to every inhabitant of the property at Guisachan
I at once say that Mr Chisholm was entirely correct in stating that I when I took possession of Guisachan in  found sixteen tenants
There were two large sheep farmers and fourteen small crofters and he was also quite correct in saying that not one of those sixteen is now remaining with land on the property
But admitting that I deny entirely that Mr Chisholm was right in any of the details he gave or right in saying that those men were evicted
The only one instance that could bear the colour of an eviction was the case of John Macdonald the innkeeper
John Macdonalds house was little better than a bothy
He had some land and he paid  a year of rental
His sale of whisky was very considerable and there were constant rows and constant brawls between the great number of workmen I was employing at that time and also among the labouring population of the place
I told Macdonald that unless he could dispense with his licence for selling whisky he would have to remove at the expiry of his lease which was in  nine years after my coming to the place
Macdonald said it was impossible he could make a living without selling whisky
He left the property at the expiry of his lease in  and settled at Invermorriston
If Mr Chisholm calls that an eviction I do not myself but it is the only case that would bear the smallest colour of an eviction of any kind or sort
My great wish is to be as brief as possible and to take up as small a space of the Royal Commissioners valuable time as possible and therefore last evening I put a few notes on paper in order to show what was the state of Guisachan in  when I took possession and how Guisachan stands today
I may say that previous to making the purchase of Guisachan I had rented various grouse moors in the county Guisachan among the number in  It was a place of great natural beauties and capabilities also affording good grouse shooting
For these reasons I purchased the property Lord at what was then before railway days considered a fancy price
I certainly did not purchase it on account of its rental then only  exclusive of the shooting rent
The shooting rent in  when I rented it was  The estate was said to contain about  acres but Mr George Mackay after a careful survey in  gave an acreage on his map of  Later on a few years since the Ordnance Survey gave  of an acreage
I believe Mr Mackays acreage to be the correct one
It was stated a few years since before the House of Commons that the population of Guisachan in  was  inclusive of those residing at Guisachan house
In  there were two farm houses one of them slated two other cottages and fortythree bothies the large majority of which were built of boulders and stones with wooden vents and heather thatched
The schoolroom of the place where the Church of Scotland held services occasionally on Sundays was  feet by  feet height  feet  inches
This room is still standing and forms part of a cottage
In  there were sixteen tenants in all paying in the aggregate  Of this amount the two large sheep farmers strangers to the place and introduced in  paid  leaving  to be paid by the other fourteen tenants
Taking the acreage at  Mr Mackays survey  the two sheep farmers held  acres at a rental of  the fourteen crofters sixtyfour arable acres twentyone of pasture and  of moorland in common in all  acres at a rental of  The total of the arable land at Guisachan in  as given in Morrisons book of  which was made at the time of the crofters were given their leases was  acres and  pasture the total arable and pasture at Guisachan
Yes
Of the larger portion of this arable land namely  acres about  lay between the river and the only approach road the breadth between river and road varying from  to  yards and it is unnecessary to say that the approach road was used in common by the tenants as also by the two sheep farmers
The sheep farmers had not been doing well for some time
The larger one Alexander Cameron emigrated to Australia in  assisted by his brotherinlaw Mr Williamson of Knockiln and myself and the other settled at Fort William in  there having been breaks in their leases
John Cameron
They were two brothers
Alexander introduced John
The fourteen crofters leases expired in  Some three or four had previously asked to be relieved of their crofts but there was not one removed or one who left until provided with either a better farm or an occupation more suitable to himself
I have here the names of the fourteen small tenants the quantity of land they each occupied the rents they paid and the dates of their either leaving or dying
I have mentioned the two sheep farmers
I then come to Auchblair in which there were four tenants
They occupied  acres arable land and  pasture and the four tenants between them paid  of rental
John Macdonald died at Guisachan in  John Fraser died at Guisachan in  William Fraser died at Guisachan in  William Macdonald went to New Zealand in  before the expiration of his lease
He left of his own accord
At Tomich there were three tenants John Macdonald the innkeeper of whom I have already spoken Alexander Macdonald died in  Alexander Fraser blacksmith died in  at Guisachan
At Easter Auchnaheglish there were two tenants  Robert Grant died in  at Guisachan Alexander Macdonald left Guisachan in  and settled at Belladrum near Beauly
Wester Auchnaheglish five tenants Colin Macdonald left Guisachan in  and went to Croil about six miles off Donald and John Fraser had a small  holding between them for which they paid   Douald died in  John was placed at a small brewery which I had built at Tomich and which he left in  Donald Macdonald crofter paying  died at Guisachan in  Alexander Fraser miller died at Guisachan in  That is a list of the fourteen tenants said by Mr Colin Chisholm to have been evicted
I have shown that the majority died at Guisachan years after they were said to have been evicted
I will now speak of  Considerably larger sums than the purchase money of the estate have been expended since  in building levelling trenching reclaiming land draining fencing and making roads and bridges
The population is now  exclusive of those resident at Guisachan House for six months of the year
There are now thirtyseven good houses and cottages that is inclusive of the two farm houses and the two cottages on the property in  That is thirtythree entirely new ones and four have been repaired reroofed and slated
They are all built of hewn stone and slated
To each house is attached a garden varying from a quarter to half an acre
A shilling a week is the rent for each with the exception of two the tenants of which pay   per annum
The very poor pay no rent
All the working men on the estate are employed regularly at s or s per week the skilled labourers s s and s the women at Is and Is d per day
The wages are paid on the last Saturday in each month and exclusive of manager and keepers they amount to over  per annum
That is at the present time when all the large works have been completed and things have been placed in regular working order
I consider that the property is more than doubled if not trebled in value since  I may say generally that there is no district I am acquainted with that has more greatly improved than Strath Glass during the last twenty years
I am speaking now especially of The Chisholms property that is in regard to the comfort and welldoing and the dress of the inhabitants their houses and the greatly improved state of agriculture in the strath
Should it be thought right that the straths and glens should again be thickly populated as they were once said to have been Government should make either a railroad or a tramway in each strath or glen
The Highland Railway has done more than all the other causes during the fifty years put together to deprive the straths and glens of their population
The working people must and will go to the near neighbourhood of the railway towns and stations
No man rests contented with paying   a ton for the carriage of his coals lime and food which he must do if he lives twenty miles from a railway and no man earning s per week the smallest sum given in Strath Glass can afford the time to winter his peats as he did in former times
It is cheaper for him to buy coals and to pay for their carriage at the rate of   per ton coals go so much further than peats
Besides a working man in a strath at a distance from a town contrives to get a considerable quantity of wood free
I omitted to state that there are now about  acres of trenched and improved land at Guisachan about  arable and about the same quantity of pasture
In addition to the expenditure on my own place I have rented a shooting lodge and a farm from The Chisholm
I spent  on building a shooting lodge on The Chisholms property and  in making sixty acres of new land and draining thoroughly draining  acres of arable
I built a schoolhouse as well
The schoolhouse now serves as a church for the Church of Scotland and the minister of it resides now at the new inn which I built some years since and in which I placed an old servant of mine a native of the place
Whisky was still sold and I thought it best to do away with the inn to stop importation
I may say that the notes I have read from are all  taken from the estate book of Mr Morrison in  made for the late Mr Fraser of Culbokie from my rental sheet for  and from the Guisachan book from  to
Since  They came in  Alexander Cameron left in  and John Cameron in
I cannot say it was before my time
Certainly not
Of the two large holdings on grazings I put about something short of  acres into forest
In those  acres there was not a single cottage save a keepers and a shepherds
The shepherd has been moved lower down and the keeper still remains there
Certainly not under cultivation neither as pasture nor as arable land
No there is no trace
There were remains of a few wallsloose stonesand I am told they were occupied as shielings by people who came up to feed their black cattle towards the end of the last century
Yes to a certain extent in the more favoured spots but it is very exposed
No certainly not
It must have been held by some large farmer I should think from the south probablyfrom some of the southern counties in Scotland
I found the remains of these old sheilings and the late Lord Lovat told me the way he accounted for the quantity of birchwood about Guisachan was this that he remembered as a young man that there was not such a thing as birch and the birch sprang up when the black cattle were removed and the sheep put on about
It may be so
Yes I know nothing
Every now and then a shepherd came down to say that a stag had been seen
The first season I was there in looking back at the old game bookI killed three deer
Yes
To Invernessshire
I dont think it
With the exception ofthe innkeeper who left on the expiration of his lease because I would not allow him to take out a licence again 
Yes nineteen years leases
The leases were granted in  and expired in
No
I think not
Yes and years after the expiration of their leases
They all fell in in
Yes three of them I think
I was requested to take their portions
I will not be certain
Yes that was about the number
Yes some three or four were the Macdonalds whom I have already mentioned
No
My object in taking that large farm was simply to afford employment for the people living on the estate
Had it not been for that large farm it was impossible I could have found employment for the people at present on the place
Yes and I doubled the size of it besides renting a considerable farm from The Chisholm
No I might have left the small portion at Easter Auchnaheglish but Robert Grant died and the other man left the place
Yes
They retained it all
Your Lordship asked about the two tenants at Easter Auchnaheglish
Robert Grant died there in  two years after the expiration of the lease and not one of those men left without having provided himself either with a better farm or with an occupation which he preferred
Provided by those who wentby other peoplebut those who remained have been enjoyed with me up to the time of their death
No but the population I may say was larger in  than it is at this moment and the number of bothies in  was larger than the improved stone and slated houses now
Yes the keepers of course have and then there is one man the general dealer but I may say all of them have milk
I keep a very large number of cows and there is a place where they go and are supplied with as much milk as they require at a very small price
On weekly wages
I would not say altogether on sport
Considerably more than the half of the sum I mentioned is spent on farm labour
Yes
Some are employed in the garden and in various other ways
Yes
No leases
Yes
Yes that is so
But then on the other hand had those small tenants remained the condition of the other squatters if you may call them soother people on the estate would have been now even more miserable than it was in  and anything more wretched and povertystricken cannot be conceived
I knew nothing of the men who were said to be dependent upon the larger tenants
I knew nothing of that arrangement
I can answer you if you tell me what on earth I could have done with the  people who were on the property in  irrespective of the sixteen tenants because it was a case of this kind whether the sixteen tenants were to leave or the  or  other people and I thought it better to provide for the larger number
They were on the place living in dry stone bothies with wooden ventsthose bothies scarcely thatchedno shoes or stockings
As to the two sheep farmers one of them lived in a slated house and the other in the farm house that was thatchedboth good enoughbut there is no labourer on the place who now lives in such a house as the fourteen tenants lived in in
I have a plan of the estate in the next room and you will see that it is an excessively narrow strip of land and that it is only at the east end that any cultivation is possible
I may say that half a mile west of the house there are no signs of cultivation of any kind at all
I also say it would be impossible to grow either oats or turnips on any portion of the land west of Guisachan Housesay a mile west of Guisachan House
For thirteen or fourteen miles west of Guisachan House it would be an impossibility either to ripen corn or grow turnips
It is very small indeed in the valley  feet at Guisachan House and  feet at Cogie in the valley four miles west
Very precipitous
No I am clearly in favour of small tenantsclearly in favour of small crofters
There would have been small crofters at Guisachau if Guisachan had been double the size
If I could have found occupation for the people and given them crofts I should have done it
Without the farm it would have been impossible to have given them occupation
But you spoke of Guisachan not being favorably situated
On the contrary I think it is most favourably situatedonly  feet above the sea
East of Guisachan we grow magnificent oat crops and magnificent turnips and it is a very mild place but west of Guisachan there is no land on which you could grow either oats or turnips and there is not a trace of a ploughshare half a mile west of Guisachan House
Not a trace

Yes considerably more
I would say so
I purchased before the age of railways and before the mania for deer forests
I think I can explain that
I did mention that I had paid  for the grouse shooting in  If I was to let it out as a deerforest I should have  or  for it
If all are charged with the county rates and so forth it will be as broad as it is long
You only want a certain sum of money for your rates and taxes and it is as broad as it is long
Yes because it has never been let
I receive no rental if I live there
On the contrary the expenditure is very great indeed
I said it was stated before a committee of the House of Commons
I do not say it was not so but that appears to me to be a very large number
Well in the first place I could make it up to  at once by including the residents at Guisachan and I suppose the residents at Guisachan House in  were included
But even say it is only  I dont think the decrease would be very great as times go because there is no doubt in my mind that the Highland Railway has caused a greater amount of depopulation in the Highland glens and straths than all the other causes put together in the last fifty years
The grandfather was
I do not know it but I fancy the last proprietor during the time he was proprietorwhich was for a few years onlywas in America the greater portion of the time
Yes
Quite so
No there was only one Chisholm
Alexander Cameron paid 
Yes for Cogie and down to the Guisachan gates almost
No John Cameron rented that and paid 
Yes in fact they occupied  acres out of 
One
No one and William Macdonald
The four tenants were John Macdonald John Fraser William Fraser and William Macdonald in
No
Here is the book of  and I notice they speak of John Macdonald sen and then John Macdonald
Yes
I know nothing about cottarsyou mean servitors of the big tenants
I know nothing about them
I saw it stated by Colin Chisholm but I know nothing to the contrary and I do not admit it as a fact
I read it three or four years before I purchased the estate
It was in the market several years
They were most respectable and a nicer population of tenantry could not be seen
That is not quite the case because there was no person no cottage nobody living half a mile west of Guisachan House and that would be over  acres out of  It was quite a narrow strip on which all these people lived
Yes he was in the Guards and his trustee was Mr Sandeman of some house of business in London
You see I do not know the exact date of Culbokies death but those crofters were there previous to
Six months either November or May on leaving my service
No
It would be simply impossible for any person to live up there who was not paid wages that is just the long and the short of it
It is impossible for any person to live at Guisachan unless he receives wages from the proprietor at Guisachan
Because the land at Guisachan which was  acres was not sufficient to employ all the people on the Guisachan estate
I was desirous of employing every person and therefore I took this farm from The Chisholm
There are about  acres at Kerrow and I trenched a place called Crannich  acres belonging to The Chisholm
I hope those who will come after me will look after the people in the same way
I have but I do not see any use contemplating a thing in which one will have no voice
You mean give them the fee simple
But if I gave them leases how could I employ the greater proportion of the people at Guisachan
I have taken a farm from The Chisholm for the express purpose of giving emplovment to the people and therefore if I was to give leases of farms on my own property how would it be possible for me to employ other people
I have said I should infinitely prefer a system of small crofters but the land at Guisachan would not keep the number who lived on the place in  in comfort and I say that more abject poverty than existed at Guisachan in  I never saw and it was borne out by the late Mr Williamson who was speaking of it at the dinner when The Chisholm took possession of his property
He spoke of it then and gave very great offence
Most certainly not
If you ask me now I think I made a mistake in buying Guisachan at all
Quite so
Yes
I dont think so
I do
Yes
The average in  was something under twenty and the average attendance now is fortythree
It is a very good schoola boys school and a girlsand in the boys school on Sundays a Scotch service takes place
A minister is sent up by a committee of the church
They will go and I have no doubt in my own mind that the Highland glens are being depopulated by that more than by any other cause
Yes
and not a large one on which a few years ago a little over  was lost in one spring by death in the ewe stock
The sheep stock in the Highlands was never in greater excellence than now and never of greater money value it is not too much to say that the stock on many farms is of considerably more value than half the actual value of the farm itself
Can it be possible that a gigantic interest such as this is to be tampered with by making experiments such as many utterly unacquainted with the real question now venture to propose
experiments too that would certainly pauperise in a very few years the class intended to be benefited and not only so but the land and the stock to be experimented with would be so deranged and ruined that a period of fiveandtwenty years would not suffice to restore either the one or the other
These are no extreme views but views arrived at after a long and intimate experience of the several questions evolved but whether these views are believed in or not I know they are not generally commended but sometimes actually condemned
On looking closely however this condemnation will be found to come sometimes from those whodo not altogether practise what they preach
We have a rather striking instance of this in one jf the Glenelg delegates who in his evidence somewhat significantly warns the Highland proprietors of coming danger and tells them  to give their small tenants more land before the spirit of Socialism gets possession of the Highlands
No one can fail to see the underlying dangerous influence of such a warning particularly as it comes from the church
If however we look at the actings of this same speaker we find that in place of supplying either cottars or croftersalthough there are a few of the former living on his extensive glebe who recently very urgently demanded an allottment of land from Mr Baillie this speaker lets his glebe lands almost entirely both arable and pasture and to a tenant occupying adjoining lands to the extent as reported of  acres
It might well be asked of this counsellor seeing what his views are whv the glebe cottars were not supplied from arable lands lying at their very doors before these lands were let to one who is already the holder of so much
Every person of ordinary observance who either lives in or frequents the Highlands must see that there is need for improvement in the circumstances of the working and fishing population and that it is a very easy matter with people in that condition to arouse that discontent and excitement that have of late been so conspicuous amongst a hitherto peaceable class and well it would be if those whose privilege and duty it is to give counsel would have the honesty and the courage to teach the propriety of more diligence and industry and even to tell many who seem to forget the fact that misery and poverty are the certain outcome of morbid indolence and discontentment
Much of the teaching given of late has been on different lines with already in some cases sad results
In nothing has this teaching been more successful than in rooting out and destroying the naturally good feeling and healthy dependence that have so long been cherished as binding elements between Highland lairds and their tenants both great and small and it is to be deplored that not a little of this teaching has emanated from a quarter whence it ought to be least expected
I have said that an extension of the crofters system in the Highlands is not to be approved of and I have given some of my reasons for so saying and I believe that to raise the crofter from his present position to that of a  farmer by any artificial means is impracticable and even were it not so it would certainly lead to disaster to the parties so treated and that within a very short time
And all who know anything of practical sheep farming must know that large grazings surrounded by crofters or small fanners would be altogether unlettable at their real value as well as unworkable
In such cases nothing could prevent trespassing and the consequent abusive disturbance of stock and the effects of this during breeding seasons would be ruinously vexations to large farmers and besides all this there would be great risk from disease that has so constantly to be guarded against and which would be ruinous in large stocks although little thought of in small
Something however may undoubtedly be done towards the permanent amelioration of the labour ing and fishing population of the Highland and Islands over and above giving them cows grazings and potato land
Is it not the fact that deepsea fishing is comparatively neglected along the whole western seaboard and sealochs of Scotland and is it not likely that if properly prosecuted these would afford an enormous source of employment and wealth as well as largely increase the food supply of the kingdom
I cannot speak from actual experience of this but I am well aware that large numbers of wellequipped fishermen come long distances and at very great expense from the east coast of Scotland and elsewhere and often reap goodly harvests under the very uoses of those who it may be said live upon the spot
This is more in respect of herring fishing I admit but these men would readily prosecute line fishing in the west as they do at home ha I they the same facilities for sending their fish to market
It is no doubt true that deepsea fishing in the west is a perilous calling as it is everywhere and from this and various other causes it has never been prosecuted by local fishermen to an extent worth naming
But surely something can be done to promote this great industry in the west as has been done elsewhere so as not only to give profitable employment to the superabundant population who are almost to a man naturally seamen and fishermen but also to increase the national food supply
Might not some thorough experiments be made both in line fishing and in trawling and made in the presence of local fishermen who if possible ought to take part in the work
And if these experiments should prove at all satisfactory or even encouraging improved Jumps anchorage and the erection of landing piers to a reasonable extent ought to follow
We know that some of the better varieties of flat fish and also haddock are not to be found in the west coast waters but cod ling saithe lithe mackerel halibut and many other varieties of excellent table fish are iu great abundance and in large sizes but unless for immediate family wants scarcely an attempt at fishing is made
Shoals of excellent mackerel were this season in abundance in several lochs in the west but local fishermen said they were not worth the catching they could not sell them and they could not cure them
All this shows that the means for transport ing fish in a fresh state to market is also required and thus all the more should deepsea fishing be prosecuted as it ought to be
The herring only is regarded as worth fishing for in a wholesale fashion in the west and it is sad to see scores yes hundreds of ablebodied young men waiting day after day and week after week in idleness for herrings to appear
Sometimes this waiting is not in vain and extraordinary harvests are reaped
I believe it is not too much to say for there is good evidence of the fact that during the seasons  and  upwards of  worth of herrings were caught and sold off one sealoch in the west of Invernessshire
This fact one can scarcely realise for the sum named is larger than one years total rental of this large county
Not so this year however for it is to be feared that the herring fishing in the west of Invernessshire has been almost a blank and the waiting spoken of has therefore been in vain
It is this waiting for a harvest they are accustomed to have for the reaping that has proved the very bane of our Highland crofter fishing population
The provident outlook so requisite to enable the working classes every where to provide for a rainy day is almost unknown in the West Highlands and the result of this cannot be otherwise than it is
The same indolent improvidence amongst the working classes in the low country would bring about a state of misery tenfold more than is known in the West Highlands for there a wholesome fish diet can always be had by the very poorest
And while this is largely trusted to and is the cause of much improvidence it can hardly be doubted that had local fishermen in the west the means and the knowledge for prosecuting deepsea line fishing or trawling they would not be so often waiting in idleness and although deepsea fishing might be less a harvest than herrings the regular employment thus induced would lead up to increased dilligence and more independence as well as more real comfort to themselves and their families and they would be all the same ready when herrings should appear to take advantage of their favourite calling
The worst for our west coast fisherman is that when heavy shoals of herrings do appear east coast fisherman are at once upon the scene and these fishermen with their superior boats and nets and greater courage all but drive our local men off the waters and the gleanings of the field so to speak are all that falls to their share
It is in respect of all this that I think the most solid and lasting help might be given to the superabundant population in the west in some such way as I here suggest
Some have suggested emigration but it is useless to talk of emigation to these people they have not the courage to emigrate
Their fear would be that as at home tbey would be crushed aside and thus left to starve
Their energies must first be aroused and a spirit of greater independence stirred up and if this can be done the west coast Highlander has both intelligence and physique to enable him to  keep his own both at home and in any other part of the world
At present his energies and his intelligence are comparatively lost both to himself and to the country at large
Yes
I am not aware
Never
No
He left of his own accord
Not at all
I never received a formal complaint of any kind
I knew quite well that there were bickerings amongst themI presume that is not uncommonbut I received no formal complaint
I knew there was no occasion for complaint
There was no litigation in connection with the estate
There may have been between him and private individuals but it had nothing to do with the estate or with the management of the estate
He did
I am not sure how far it spread
I know it was very hurriedly got up
I was present at the presentation and I know he got a presentation a few years before that of very considerable value from the people generally
Yes
Yes
Mr France had a very difficult duty to perform
The Kingussie people are feuars and with the exception of half a dozen tenants I dont know Mr Maclennan had anything to do with them in the way of control but in Glenelg it was a very different thing entirely
Mr France exerted himself for the amelioration of the people in a variety of ways
It is well known that no man can deal with any affairs without giving offence somewhere and I say that the people with whom Mr France came into contact particularly the working peoplewere very much ameliorated from his residence amongst them
Yes and he continued an advocate for temperance and improved the circumstances of the people very much in consequence
Well I am afraid it can be attributed to a cause which is too general in that part of the country
I have heard it said that climatic influences are at work but I dont believe anything of the kind
I have taken those people repeatedly and given them periods of employment and though it appeared very irksome at first to keep our hours they came to be tolerably good workers but no sooner did they go amongst those at home inclined for idleness than they became as illdisposed to do a days work as ever
It is a large acreage
Oh 
noEileanriach Arnisdale Scalisaig Beolary Kyle Rhea and Balraid
There are half a dozen large farms at least
Scalisaig on the one side and Beolary on the other
I know there has been a considerable population in that glen at one time by the ruins I see there
Well judging by the circumstances of those who have been left upon subjects as suitable as that I would say the reverse for there was anything but comfort among those who were allowed to remain
I should say that those who emigrated did well for judging by the circumstances of those who were left there is not much inducement to say it was a mistake
I was not in the least degree aware of anything being said that required to be contradicted
No
A temporary one
Yes twice
Well I can only speak for myself
I say I consider it would be a mistake
I say distinctly that there is a great charm that attaches to a croft and almost every one who has a home has the idea that he would like to have land but from my experience I say he would be a great deal better without it because it keeps him at home and there is an inducement or excuse and he does not take out of the land all he could take out of it
Considering the mode of cultivation and the climate it is very little so far as my judgment goes that can be made out of a Highland croft
I did not hear it fully
Yes but that extends to something larger than we have any experience of in Glenelg
Only to the west coast
Not at all
There is no doubt there is good soil there but we have always to contend with the climate and apart from growing green crops and hay for stock I am not convinced by any means that it would be a profitable thing to grow grain crops there
I would sooner see large arable farms cut up for crofts than talk of breaking up Highland grazings
I think it would create a disappointment and diminution of value that a great many of those who are speaking of it have no conception of
I dont approve of emigration at all if the people can be supported at home and I repeat I would sooner see arable farms broken up and made suitable for the population than make any attempt to divide the grazing land because the grazing land is only profitably worked in large sections
I know it is impossible to keep stock profitably and carry on a system of breeding as it should be without a large stock and it would almost amount to the value of some of the subjects to attempt it
I see no reason why some of the arable land should not be made available and if we were able to induce our Highland population who have plenty of physique and intelligence to occupy arable land in the low country where they would see the operation done they could not but be spurred up to apply themselves with more energy and they would acquire skill when they saw it on every side of them
Yes
None
I heard of it by mere report because I did not see it in the newspapers
It was reported to me by people in Glenelg that it was stated the Corran villages were deprived of land that was at one time allotted to them as grazing
I made particular inquiry on the two occasions I have been in Glenelg since as to whether these were facts or not and the answer I got from two of the oldest men was that there was no change whatever that from all timeat least during the last fifty or sixty yearsthe arrangement was that whoever took an animal to a certain grazing paid a certain sum for it
they have had to give up a certain section of land so that it could be fenced as a common grazing for these villages and what led Mr Baillie to adopt that was what took place on the banks of the Spey
There we have common grazing and as much as forty or fifty acres at so much a head and my impression is that if these people want cows that is the most simple and workable way
The ground is near their homes where they could drive an animal and bring it in with little trouble and make  the whole thing more workable but up to this time only one individual has asked for the privilege
If even halfadozen would ask for it it would be at once supplied
It is
They might be
If I am certain of anything I hear I am certain of that
Well here it issurely a better provision than if they had had it
I dont say he refused but I say he condemns such action as that and I know he lets his glebe almost entirely with the exception of two small fields
He lets his entire glebe pasture and arable to the adjoining tenant
No but I know there are parties living on the glebe and if they had asked Mr Baillie it would have been more convenient than part of the glebe lands
We were engaged in the erection of a sawmill and pitching a considerable stretch of the beach where the sea had been encroaching upon the arable land round from the Established Church to almost the mouth of the Elg
It would last for so many months it is not finished yet
There has been always employment on Glenelg estate duriug the last fifteen years
There has been from  up to  or  expended on labour alone
I have taken the trouble to inquire and I have the notes in my pocket if necessary for every year since
There will be a population of  or 
I dont think the population of Mr Baillies property is more than
No it is occupied by the proprietor
I know it was at first from the death of one of the tenants
No
The farm was advertised in the ordinary way in various newspapers
Yes we had offers
Yes it was the rent that was the difficulty
It was not more than half of what the farm was rented at a few years ago
Yes
No
I knew there was an element in operation that was bringing about such a miserable offer as that which in all probability would be out of the way in a short time
I heard of it today at this table
I refer to the extreme rates that have to be paid where stock is taken over at a valuation
I think if it does not come to an end the letting of sheep farms will come to an end because very few men are able to pay such extraordinary rates
I call it a fictitious valuation
I mean the difference between the valuation and the market value of sheep
I dont see any difficulty as the farm gets out of lease in adopting the principle of giving and taking stock and making it optional to both parties
If you have an incoming tenant he might or might not take the stock
Every one knows that the stock bred upon the farm is of more value to the incoming tenant than to any one else
If it were left to the two men the incoming tenant might say I admit it is of more value to me than any stock I can buy in the market and the outgoing tenant would not be such a fool as to take them to the market where he would get no more than the market price
There is nothing to prevent the proprietor implementing his agreement with the tenant that is going away and making a different arrangement with the man that is coining in
Mr Baillie is doiug it
He is taking over the stock and when the farm is let again I am bound to say there shall be no such system iu operation
I have been able to effect it with another farm when out of lease that he shall give it to the incoming tenant without this system of valuation being maintained
No but you can surely step in between the two tenants and say I take the stock from the outgoing tenant and I can give it to incoming tenant by a mutual agreement between us and then he starts fair
It is so
Only once
Yes
We have three little districts that are occupied by croftersone almost in the immediate neighbourhood of the town another right behind Dochfour and another to the west of Dochfour
It would still depend upon the class of grazings
You might be disposed to give every low country crofter his pasture along with his arable land but if it was to involve to keeping of stock separate then if the pasture were to any extent pasture such as a moor I would say it would be just as right that it should be held in common in the low country as in the Highlands
I see no difficulty at all
I may mention that one set of crofts upon the Dochfour property at a former period had a common grazing attached to these crofts
That has not been in operation since Mr Baillie succeeded to th property but it was up to a very short timeup to the immediate period before he got possession of it
I allude to the crofts of Lochend to the west of Dochfour
These crofts at one time had a common grazing as I understand it and when the property was purchased by Sir John Ramsden about whom one of the Commissioners knows it was done with the object or at all events it was done for the ostensible reason of making an excambion with Dochfour and during the interval of being purchased from Sir John Ramsden I am able to state that the crofters of this immediate district were deprived of their hill grazing
That I believe however much Mr FraserMackintosh may have changed his mind since was carried out by himself as commissioner for Sir John Ramsden and those people were deprived of their hill grazing and a very great hardship it was considered to be
It was before I had anything to do with it but not before my time
It was immediately before the excambion was carried out of the Laggan estates
As to the crofters in the immediate neighbourhood of the town here there is no pasture attaching to them at all
Every crofter has so many acres arable land and every crofter has his independent subject with probably his horse and cart and when he is not employed at home he is employed at carting stones or whatever labour may be going at the time and these people are so far as I know in perfect comfort
I see from the papers it was stated by one of those who were examined on Thursday I think that this same set of crofts at a recent period was increased in rent  per cent
Now I would tell the speaker that this statement was exactly  per cent from the truth for the increase was precisely the half of that or very nearly and I have no hesitation in saying that if these crofts were exposed in the market they would bring double the rent they are paying now
I myself had an offer at the time of  for the whole to be held as one and it is let for  and the former rent was 
No it is different altogether
They are an excellent industrious class of crofters here both in the immediate district and elsewhere
About twentyeight
About s an acre
Five or six are just what are called black folds
From eight to nine acres
 is the present rent of those in the Sligachan district
It was represented that it h i d been raised  per cent but formerly it was  s d
The total average is  acres
It is slightly under   per acre
The Lochend district has  acres and present rent is  or slightly above   per acre in fact s or s d
Not very much under it
It will not be under s or s
The greater part is rented at s
It is close by the town and suited for dairy purposes a good deal
Yes and some of it used as dairy farms
No the land at Lochend is better than any of it
Yes about s
That is so
That is what it was on the st of January when I ascertained the exact number
It is impossible to tell
It may be that they have no desire for the bother of cows or are not able to purchase a cow but it is not because there is not keep for a cow because I made the offer when Mr Baillie took possession of this farm that cows and cattle should be taken iu upon this farm of Eileanriach at s for each beast and with two exceptions that was all that was asked
As to the other village there is no truth in the statement that the tenant charges   
I am satisfied that is for one cow and two followers bat unless I am misinformed we are ready to give grazing on such terms as are reasonable
This grazing has been quite open
It is close to one village while Eileanriach comes up to another village
There is a provision in Mr Milligans lease that land can be taken off and fenced for cottars and fishermens cows if required and if requested it will be done
I dont think that not in the Highlands
I am confident that any attempt to grow grain will be disappointing there compared to being without land altogether so long as they hive a cow and land for a potato crop
I scarcely think it is that because with the extraordinary fishing last year and the previous year  am aware those people were not without money
No there is no doubt they are in worse circumstances this year than last
It has been perhaps as disappointing a year as they have had for a long time
No that part of Eileanriach that comes close to this village is about thirteen miles from Eileauriach and there is no part of that land they could possibly get but it is quite different with the other farm
There is excellent green land that comes close to them
No the proprietor holds Eileanriach farm in his hands just now and it would spoil it to separate the arable from the grazing
It is twelve miles from Eileanriach proper but it is still part of the farm that comes in behiud the village and most convenient for them only I dont call it firstrate grazing because it is a very choice part that the villagers would be supplied from and this part of Eileanriach is not really the same class of grazing
Well there is no room at home just now
I do
I wont say  acres because that happened to be the size that was let when these crofts were laid off and from what I read and hear the proprietor at the time said he objected to give the fishermen whose proper calling was the sea crofts of any extent beyond what would supply them with potatoes and vegetables and on that account this land was laid off in the sizes I have mentioned and remains so with the exception of one or two that have fallen out and I suppose fallen into the adjoining lot
If it is a croft for the people situated as they are  acres is enough but then they are fishermen
No we have had experience of that too
One of the subjects Mr Baillie owns was fourteen years ago let to three tenantsone tenant having half and the other two a fourth each previous to that it had been let in fourths
One of them failed and gave up his position entirely
It was about the size you speak of and the other offered for the subject as one
I took the lowest offer of the two and now that party has failed also
This shows that that size of subject is not suitable and it quite corresponds with my own experience
I know if they had not great enterprise or means to fall back upon they must have been ruined during the last five or six years and I say that with any such period as that coming upon tenants such as you now speak of nine cases out of ten would simply be pauperism
I dont think it because here if the croft is too small to employ him he can do something with his horse or by hand labour
Yes very much so
Yes
No not at all
I would be a strong advocate for mediumsized arable farms but I would be the reverse in regard to grazing farms unless they are made unwieldy
I hold that shepherding managing marketing and everything that follows the management of sheep stock can be done cheaper on a large scale than on a small one and it is not within my experience that those small tenants will maintain the breeding of sheep to that state of excellence that would command a price such as those command who know it by experience and who are leaving no stone unturned to have their stocks in the best possible condition
Perfectly true and I am quite willing to admit that if you get a man of skill with say  from my calculation that would enable him to secure a possession that would be employment for him and probably one or two of his family but unless he has full employment he is throwing his time away
I am confident of that
I have been at pains to ascertain it
Yes
Tenants under   rent were two years in arrears in  and five years arrears in  tenants under   rent were  year in arrears in  and   years in arrears in  tenants under  rent were  year in arrears in  and  year in arrears in  tenants over  were  year in arrears in  and  year in arrears in  On the estate of Benbecula the arrears in  were  In  they amounted to  with the same rents
This increase of  arrears took place almost entirely on the various tenants under  of yearly rent and more especially under   of annual rent
The rental of the estates in  was  and in  it was about  being an increase of  The following statement shows that this increase arises almost entirely on the rents of the tacksmens holdings hotels and fishing stations only a small proportion of the increase falling to the crofters   The increase of croftersrents in twenty years is thus only a little over  but the extent of land occupied by the crofters in  is greater than the extent occupied by them in
Well they are much the same take it all in all
Well they are nearly equal
It is something like s
Yes
Eight seperate tenants
Yes
Yes
Yes
It is over it
Yes a good deal more
No
No
It was done before my time and I cannot speak of that
I think the most of it is on the crofters ground
What has been done this summer has been entirely on the crofters ground
Yes
No it could scarcely be expected that the same prospect could be offered by any proprietor to a number of people
I have no doubt some assistance will be given
Yes
Yes
Yes I believe they have
Yes
Yes
It was given to the neighbouring crofters
No
Yes
Yes
I am not aware there is any intention to do so
Precisely
Yes
Yes
Yes
In my opinion that is their only salvation
Well there are so many people that really it is only putting off the evil day and so far as my experience goes there is no salvation for these people except by emigration
That might be done if there were a chance of doing it
Yes
There may be a few but very few I believe
Yes
You might get a few of them
No doubt
Yes at present
It is intended to be given out as lots to crofters
Perhaps from six to fifteen acres
From  to   crofts I would say
No
It could scarcely maintain them without fishing
Yes
Yes
I may mention that I think if some people were leaving these islands a Free Church minister or priest should go along with them
That would encourage some of them to leaveif they got a clergyman of their own denomination
I know that from a number of the people
Yes
Well some of them are willing to go but others appear to have a reluctance to go
Yes
Quite so
Yes by and by
Entirely out of the common pasture except two fields which were taken out of some crofts
I believe that
I have not heard anything of that but I think they should do it
I am sure of it
About seven months
Yes
Yes
Yes
I did not take notice of that
He is not home from America yet
I think he will be at the Edinburgh meeting
Most of it was
There was a contractor imported who gave work to the local people in budding hotels
Not since I went therenot to my knowledge
They were all local tradesmen that were employed
It might have occurred I cannot speak to that
Surely
Some of it may have been kept off for rent but I think most of the arrears are standing still all over the property
Yes
Yes I am aware it has been acted upon
No I am not aware of it
I dont believe there is such a thing
I never heard there was anything of the kind because since I went there we have never changed anything
Everything has gone on the same as before
Yes
Well there was nothing done in that way
We got a staff of gamekeepers into the island and the fishing has been stopped from everybody except those who get permission
Now that was not done for any reason whatever
It was done because we got a new staff of keepers and everybody fished and a good deal of poaching went on and for that reason the fishing was stopped from all and sundry
Some may think it was done for a purpose but I am bound to say it was not
Yes I am
Yes my sympathies are very much with the crofters
I think that if they were let alone they are a decent enough class of people and I would not be afraid of keepingthe South Uist people if they were left alone
Yes
Yes
That is the difficulty because these squatters are sonsinlaw and brothers and so on
They went there with the consent of the tenants
They are all related together and what to do with them is the question
I dont know what to do with them unless some of them emigrate
Well we are trying to do that
I am an arable farmer
No
It affects me favourably so far as they will buy from me but unfavourably so far as I may be required to pay from s to s over the net value of stock
By decreasing the number of stock available for the consumption of turnips and grass in the Lowlands
No
It is quite true that cattle and sheep may exist in superfluity in another part but you are aware of the severe restrictions now in force to exclude them from this country
Therefore the void cannot be made up so easily as it might otherwise have been
And the deer forests too
May I ask from where
It appears to me that they are exceedingly anxious to get hold of the balance of ours
If they are so plentiful in other parts of the country why are they so anxious to carry off ours
I have looked into it but I did not follow it out
I said already I dont dispute that the amount may be very small for the United Kingdom but it is very large for us
I would not object to that if all could be supplied the more the better
Nothing more reasonable
The difference would not be very great over the whole kingdom but here if we do not get stock near hand at reasonable prices what are we to do with our grass and roots
I stated they are exceedingly anxious to get the remainder of our sheep
I have it on better authority I have it on the authority of the Lowland farmers
Well I pay as much for wintering as perhaps any one in the north at the present moment and I can speak from personal knowledge
I have no great experience of hoggs it is aged wedders that I know about
I was informed that at one time they paid as high as s per head for them
No ten or twelve years ago
No
d or d
That is perfectly true in some years I know
Yes within the last two years observe
Not this last year certainly I should rather say under the average
Fairly an average I should say
No
Yes
No
I dont wish him to be protected artificially
Not particularly that but I glanced at it in passing as one of the injurious effects of the system
I dont care so much for them myself
I am a buyer
Yes
And under sheep
The real land under deer that could be reclaimed would not be so large and I take in the land under sheep as capable of cultivation
I maintain that is a very large area
Deer forests and land capable of cultivation under sheep as well both are included
Combined with land under sheep
Under sheep yes
Yes FortAugustus there is plenty of reclaimable land thereabout
Yes
Yes
Corn and cereal crops will grow in any glen in Scotland under  feet above sealevel and there are numerous river sides and haughs that could be occupied as small farms
I know hardly any glen at such an altitude but could raise all these
I should say all that can be reclaimed with advantage would raise these crops
I am not aware
Yes but one in five would make a thousand
No I would not say that
It is quite possible but I dont know any
Yes if you are going to reclaim it with steam engines and that sort of thing
My idea is that the land should be reclaimed by families
A man with three four or five strong sons about him would soon reclaim all that was worth being reclaimed if he was permitted to do so
I would fancy they would choose the best land
Wherever they got good land
I suppose there is no difficulty in finding willing hands to reclaim it
They would not be particular
Give them a good bit of land anywhere and you will find plenty for it
I dont know
I have no doubt if you offer them fair good land they will be ready to take it
They will find it in both
No
It is a very serious matter but you are forgetting entirely that you have brought it upon yourself
I suppose under the circumstances I would do the best I could
I will not say I would do that but  think it is time to consider now whether the thing is on right lines or a right basis at the present moment
I consider that under certain circumstances a man should do the best he can for himself but at the same time we must consider are they on right lines or wrong lines entirely down till now
No I do not quite understand that deer forests returning larger rentals really relieve the crofters from taxation
Yes but what do you say as to the grouse shooting
If you can have  for the grazing you have the grouse to fall back upon
Where is that forest
Well no if you keep them four or five miles away from them but what if they come down to eat their corn
It excludes land from useful occupancy
I have strong views on that question
What are the deer really worth from a national point of view
What do they produce to the common stock of the country
I have given you my reasonthat I consider for the land occupied they contribute very little to the common stock of the kingdom
That is one of the main reasons
I allow you to do the best you can under the circumstances but mend your ways in the future and dont have your farms so large again
Divide them into smaller holdings
For a farm of  acres you will have only two Duncan or three offers at the best
If it were divided into farms of  or  acres you would have fifteen or twenty offerers
A farm of  acres requires  of capital and you can only get one or two to offer whereas you can get fifteen or twenty offers for a farm of  acres
Oh no make the best you can in the meantime but mend matters as soon as you can
I would not ask anybody to sacrifice money for an idea like that
No I do not agree with it at all
It is impossible to do away with middlemen altogether
I do not not complain at all
I simply point out that it is one of the consequences of deer forests
I state it as a fact and can prove it
Certainly
Wholly in my opinion
I should say not
A great number
Yes
Yes
Yes
To prevent the spread of footandmouth disease
I am not aware
I have no recollection of it
Yes
It had an effect in keeping them from going higher
Yes
Yes a large and beautiful glen
Yes
There are two or three
I do
For fortysix or fortyseven years
Not one
Yes and yet
Yes MacPhadrig
I am not aware unless he went in with the laird of Grant
Yes
Yes
Yes he had a very nice company I am told
I should say it has
Yes
Very few if any
Quite true
There is some such land undoubtedly
They had sheep in smaller numbers
It was all carried into effect in the time of my father
I know it is the case
Which of them
There are several
No I have not heard of it
Yes I have heard some such songs
Yes
Not at all
It was necessary for the lowlanders here to send their cattle west to them
That was the system that obtained one hundred years ago and more
Yes summering cattle from Inverness and Nairn shires
I think I can show that
There is really very little change in the crofter population since I was born in Glenmorriston
They are much about the same as they were then
I have not been there for twenty years but my brothers go there occasionally and I have the whole history of what is going on
No I have not heard that and I am very sorry to hear it now
All within my memory the whole of them
Yes
Yes I have
Yes
I have not been much in the hills myself for the last twentyfive years but I am still in the sheep line and some years ago I began to make inquiry of prominent men what was the cause of the inferiority of the sheep now compared with what they were twenty years ago
I have and prosecuted inquiries in every direction
I am quite satisfied that the ground and the sheep are in very unhealthy order at the present moment and if it is of any consequence that I should name one of my informants I can do so
It is Donald Macintyre Mains of Flowerburn and tacksman of the sheep farm of Laggan and Finlay Macdonald Kintail authorises me to declare to this Commission today that since he went to Kintail thirtytwo years ago the keeping capacity of his farm is down onethird exactly
He impressed upon me to state that before the Commission and he is prepared to stand by it and substantiate it
Yes Mr Donald Macintyre declares that within the last ten years the deterioration is more pronounced
Yes
Yes I am particularly anxious to give an indication to the Commission in this direction for if it is proven and I think it is easy to prove that the ground is being ruinedif that will not rouse proprietors to a sense of their own interest I dont know what will
And I should like if I could bring it home to them that the ground is in very unhealthy order and getting worse from year to year
Very little value indeed
Except those who get the rent I am not aware of any other and those who may acquire health in the pursuit of the deer
Not at all in my opinion
Yes it is sold
By gamedealers here and elsewhere
I dont know
They have plenty of it
I dont know
If you want venison there is plenty exposed for sale
They have it in plenty
I dont know where they get it
It is supposed to be from d to Is
Cheviot sheep
Yes
They take rams from the south undoubtedly but of course the climate will affect them
I am not aware but it is quite possible
They keep blackfaced stock on the higher grounds the worst ground and Cheviot on the lower ground
Yes
I am informed not
I am afraid I cannot give that for I did not separate the inquiry
I did not pay attention to that
I should think so
That is my opinion that it is more so upon that
Yes
I may remark that the old Highlanders were very wise in their day
They had a very good system of going to sheilings with the cattle and another good system of folding them here for a week and folding them there for another
The rains came and diffused fertility in all directions
They shifted their quarters and that had a great tendency to keep the pastures in a sound healthy condition
As many cattle as winter fodder can be raised for in the low glens the more the better
Yes but in such large areas how are they going to provide for their cattle in winter
If you plant a moderate sized holding here with houses and byres a certain amount of winter fodder is provided and raised in the place j and in the absence of that I do not see how the large farmers could do it unless they go in for cultivation which they are not likely to do
I think so and the fact is that the large farmers are not fond of breaking up ground at all
Their tendency is to put what is under plough now under grass
That has been their practice and tendency for a long time back
It is a matter of expenditure and I dont think they have any will or aptitude in the other direction
I am very glad to hear it
Not since they became deer forests but I have walked over a good deal of the ground before it was turned into deer forests
Yes or thereabout or  feet
I should say there is a good deal below from  to  feet no doubt of it
Well take  I put it this way
If you travel by the Caledonian Canal to FortWilliam you will see many a deer forest right and left and I do not think any of them at the commencement are anything like the limit I have given
Yes
I am sure of it
Innumerable traces and traces of their existence formerly
Well I dont believe that there is any sane man at the present moment with a knowledge of the business and money in his pocket who would risk sheep on deer land
I am of opinion and it is the general opinion that the mortality among sheep would be excessive for a long time till the grass was again reduced to order
No I can only give it as the general opinion of practical farmers in the north of Scotland
But how long was the ground in that occupancy
No I have not
Well it is quite possible that the natural process of restoration may begin
No but I rely on the evidence of people on whom I have the utmost reliance
I think I proved that in my paper and it is the most natural proof I can give to your Lordship
If you remove sheep from a grazing in the neighbourhood of a deer forest which has been from twenty to thirty years in the occupancy of deer you will find that in the course of five or six weeks after the sheep have been cleared off the deer will remove to the once sheepcovered land and occupy it exclusively
I hold that to be a natural and conclusive test that the deer know the better and sweeter soil
Well I think if you will clear a space of ground here that has been occupied by sheep at any elevation the deer will soon find it out and in fact it is matter of complaint that when a space is recently cleared of sheep it carries away the deer
I did not separate the inquiry
Yes but my opinion is that as long as the ground was in good heart and fertility Cheviots throve but when the ground is exhausted Cheviots are dying off and as blackfaced are hardier they replace the Cheviots
I am aware there is a tendency in that direction
Yes
Not without tremendous expense which no one would care to face
Lime and phosphate
I think it is easy to prove that they are the only remedy
No
Yes
To lift up a people it is necessary to give liberty independence and property to its oppressed classes and extend the protection of the law to all alike
Let us emancipate the peasant for free labour alone sustains a nation effectually
Restore to the peasant the possession of the land he tills for the independent proprietor alone is brave in defending hearth and home
Free the citizen from monopoly and the tutelage of the bureaucracy for freedom in workshop and townhall has given to the ancient burghs of Germany the proud position he held
Teach the  landowning nobles that the legitimate rank of the aristocracy can be maintained only by disinterested service in county and the state but is undermined by exemption from taxes and other unwarrantable privileges
The bureaucracy instead of confining itself to pedantic book knowledge and esteeming red tape and salary above everything else should study the people live with the people and adapt its measures to the living realities of the times
I have nothing more to add further than this that I have seen the same class of people in North America
I was among them
I have gone through from Nova Scotia nearly to Lake Winnipeg
I lived twentythree years amongst them and I may remark that the early settlers entered at far greater  disadvantages than they would have if you put them down on any piece of cultivatable land in Scotland that I know of
They did not even know how to handle an axe and had to take everything out of the forest and yet they have done well and if our present land laws are to be maintained I would recommend every one to go there
I should be sorry to see it because I think we have not an overpopulation now though there may be cases in some particular districts
The witness who preceded me told you he could not get men to work There is evidence I think that in that part of the country at all events the population is not in excess
I do not wish to occupy your time at any length and I have drawn up this paper just because I wished to delay you as little as possible but I am fully convinced that the country will never be satisfied until there are very great changes made
It is said this has been the result of agitators
I think I am fully as old as the witness who preceded me and I know fully as much and perhaps more of the people and I know the feeling has existed from my boyhood and has been only growing in intensity and I do not believe that as education advances you will find the people more easily quieted
They understand their power and as they understand their power you will find the necessity of giving them what has been hitherto withheld
The political changes which I certainly desire to see I fear under the present system
I fear giving the people even the poor people a vote because I know in many cases they dare not vote according to their convictions
They feel afraid
There are estates I know where they would be perfectly free
I know that some of our aristocracy would be above taking advantage of their circumstances but looking at what I know is the sort of feeling if it be an evil to influence anybody with anything in the shape of money I am afraid you will have the same operation unless you give fixity of tenure
No not of actual scarcity
I have known periods when the price of land rose and fell very materially during the American war and there have been some places and some seasons when provisions were comparatively scarce but nothing like a famine
I believe so
To a large extent it is and in the northwest there is an extent of territory to which our country is as nothing
I dont know
When I look into the history of the past I find that the finest lands are sometimes visited with scarcity
Egypt has been visited with famines and Palestine and Rome and I do not know you are ever secure
I think that depends not on the soil but I think the question of famine may sometimes depend upon their religion and this is a matter which is in the Lords hand and which we cannot count upon
I have only been back six years
I was about thirtysix years when I went
Yes I was a settled minister
I was in Ballachulish
No I have walked nearly the whole way from the Mull of Cantyre to Inverness
I am a native of Jura but was brought up principally in Islay
For a long period
Yes
I heard part of yesterdays evidence
Yes
I have no doubt I am sure of it
I am quite satisfied of that
I may answer in reference to that that the difficulties which emigrants are liable to now are not what they were liable to at that early time
At the same time I am satisfied the people might be comfortable at home and that it would be a national benefit to us to retain them
We could have them as producers we could have them for the defence of the country and I can tell the Commissioners that the feeling which used to exist in my early days is dying out
People do not care for the defence of the country now as they did in those times
Yes they tell me that frequently
I heard a portion of it
Yes
Certainly
I have no doubt of it unless you give them permanent securitypermanent holdings
I mean a tenure of it but a tenure that could not be broken as long as the people paid their rents
I dont know but there might be a revaluation after a term of years but that they could not be removed
I have no doubt there is
Certainly
Yes
My contention however is that it is not for the advantage of the country to stimulate emigration
I would be perfectly willing that people should go if they pleased and I believe in a large number of instances they would benefit themselves but I would not stimulate them
I admit that but not necessarily to our advantage in this country
No doubt of that but I look at it in this aspect
You cannot secure the allegiance of these colonies
Times of difficulty may arise you are cut off from your supplies and I would like to be as little dependent upon foreign lands in these circumstances as possible
No doubt of that
I have never denied that
No
I am satisfied as to that
Yes
Quite so
There is a degree of independence in even these circumstances
A large proportion in our towns now are sunk very low just from having no trade
They go in there as mere labourers and are thrown among the common mass and they are very often sunk very low even in the scale of morals and I dont think that morals depend upon whether it is clay or any other kind of soil
I do
Well there is a large proportion of uncultivated land that I think is very little worth to anybody just now
There is a considerable portion of land extending mostly on the east side of Loch Lochy from Fort William up to the centre of Loch Lochy and some on the other side too
It is mainly on the east side and I think a good deal might be done with that and there are stretches of land in other places in the same condition
I think so
There is a considerable portion in the island of Islayland once under cultivation and now lying waste as far as cultivation is concerned
You will find the houses there now where I knew a very plentiful tenantry and there is scarcely one remaining
The whole of that large district is nearly laid waste
Yes
I think it should be assessed by independent partiesneither by the landlord nor by the tenant
I would rather see valuators appointed by the Crown
I think they should be parties acquainted with the country
I dont think you could apply any general valuators for the whole of Scotland it must be for the Highlands alone
Yes
Yes
I dont know which would be the better plan
I think it would be a much better plan if he had security for continuance on a revaluation by competent parties that he would not be dispossessed as long as he paid the rent that competent parties assessed him at
If he chose to go away let his claim be valued the proprietor having the first claim to the valuation and if he would not pay it let it be sold in the market
I think he should be allowed to deal only with the proprietor in the first instance and that he should not be allowed to sell without the proprietor having the first offer
I dont think there would but I dont think that need be left exactly in that form
My impression is that the more independent you make the people and the more they are enabled to rise the less disposed they are to divide and I know in America there is no tendency in that direction and as education advances there will be less tendency
Yes because they are educated
Yes
No I have not
That is a question I am not prepared to answer
I think they could flourish together and I think it would be a grievous hardship to compel people who are now crofters and perhaps have never practised the fishing to become fishermen always
I would just like to see some of the large farmers put in the same position
To set men who have never made a business of it to take their living from the ocean would be a piece of cruelty and we have had too much of that in the past
My impression is that if permanent holdings are given near these fishing stations that is a question that will settle itself
If they find the fishing profitable they will live by it but the great evil I think throughout a great part of our Highlands is the difficulty of getting permanent holdings for houses or for anything else
I dont know
Well a good many of them are building houses
They must have feus
It is so in Fraserburgh
Yes but if you are to gather them near harbours you are virtually making towns
I dont know if it would
If the opportunity was given them for them to try it they would draw to those points themselves if they had proper harbours and people could get feus and have their houses so that they could not be removed from them
I think in many instances it would be the tendency to draw to these places and settle there
I think it ought to be all rendered available
I would set no portions apart but I would not set about to exterminate the deer
At the same time I think there is no portion of the country so rugged as far as I can discover which if it can support deer could not support sheep
No but I have had intercourse with people over all the north
I am told that wherever deer can thrive sheep can thrive
I think so
The same principle is recognised when land is taken for railways and objects of general benefit
If it interferes with the benefit of the community it ought to be prevented
Well I would not take the land from any proprietor without compensation
I would much rather do that than see things as they are
Yes I believe so
I suppose not
Yes it benefits him to that extent
Well some of them we find are not beneficial when the process is first to clear out the land for sheep and then the next step is to clear the land for deer
I have myself seen the deer when travelling along the coast of Skye close to the poor peoples patches of potatoes and I thought I would try to disturb them and I went up to the fence and rattled on my hat but they just stood and looked at me
The people were not allowed to keep a dog to keep the deer off
Yes I admit that freely so far as the rates are concerned
I have not been in contact with them about that
The reason is this that a large portion of our population under our present laws are very much serfs they are hardly in many respects free men and the gillies I thiuk are largely injured by their employment I think it is not employment that tends in any way to advantage them
I dont know
No I mean that the crofter population are so much serfs that they are so much kept inthat they lose to a certain extent their independence
Yes
Oh no that is not what I mean
I would have the whole valued
It might be but I only advocate what is fair and just
Yes
Yes
I dont know if I would be prepared to answer that question
I think the Government ought to take steps to secure that the people should have their lands revalued
Yes
I would tax the waste lands very heavily and make it an advantage to give them back
In so far as they are unfit for agricultural purposes
Yes to the extent of their value
No I would not look upon sheep pasture necessarily as waste land at all but it is land which ought to be appropriated to other purposes and one of the things I would like to see is something in the shape of a club farm
No not the land that will not admit of being tilled
Yes I would tax it all
There is a certain amount that requires to be pastured from time to time at all events
I think the Government should settle it
I gave you a statement at Bettyhill
I think you may hold that statement as read
I was intending to criticise the evidence you had at Bettyhill and some extraordinary statements you have received since at Helmsdale the other day
I would not have been here today but I was absent the second day at Bettyhill
You asked if any large farmers were present
I could not be present and I wrote a note stating I would be glad to meet the Commissioners anywhere else
As regards the doings in Sutherlandshire I consider Sutherland has been the one county that has been more maligned and illused than any other and nowhere was there more provision made for the people than in Sutherland
Now I saw that day the great animusnot so much in what was said as in what was not saidagainst the proprietor and his agents in large towns and I should like an opportunity of contradicting it
Yes and to show that they have not been in any way inimical to the interests of the small tenants
Decidedly not
Yes
In giving them labour and employing them
We have spentmy neighbours and Iseveral thousands of our own capital besides tens of thousands of his Graces
Perhaps you would allow me to express my opinion upon the evidence you received at Bettyhill
The first witness you had there was perhaps the most bold and unscrupulous of the clergy in our district
Well I shall hold myself corrected
He said amongst many things to which I object that there was no labour to be got in the country
Now the fact is that we cannot get labourers
I have drains on my own farm lying open for three years to a large extent and I cannot get anybody to fill them
The Duke of Sutherlands factor has been trying to organise a statf of men for two or three years and he has failed
I have nearly  of his Graces money to spend at the present moment and I cannot get labour to do it
In Strathnaver itself
Yes about  and that party knew perfectly well that there were thousands of his Graces money spent on the farm of Melness thousands of money on the farm of Skelpick thousands more on Sire thousands on Bighouse and thousands on my own farm and yet he said there was no labour provided
I have the authority of the late Kenneth Murray of Geanies for saying that in one season when distress was prevalent the Duke made the Helmsdale railway at great expense to give labour to his own people and no men but Sutherland men were employed on that line
The next witness was another clergyman and he stated he had been only two or three years in the country and he deliberately told you that there had been very little improvement if any upon the houses in the Sutherland districts until the Commissioners heard tell of it
You called him in question for that statement Now I have been twentylive years in Sutherland and before that on Mr Mathesons property in the West Highlands
I know the circumstances perfectly of Sutherland Caithness and Rossshire and I can speak to every property
The houses in Sutherland have been undergoing gradual improvement for the last thirtyfive years at least
They first began to improve the houses by subdivisions inside then substituting wood rafters for the old roofs which obtained and then outside innovations began
Thatched roofs gave way to slated houses and I may say that a comfort exists which I think is second to none in the Highlands or anywhere else
I shall refer to the evidence of the minister of my own parish byandby
In regard to the matter of bridges you took some trouble to question the delegates on that point
Every delegate I am certain in that church that day knew perfectly well that the question of bridges had been virtually settled twelve months before and not one of them had the honesty to tell you so
The Duke of Sutherland is to build those bridges at his own expense
Yesto which your inquiries were particularly directed
The next is a simple matter but it very clearly shows how the wind blows
You had an old man there who is a pauper in our parish and he gave you a great deal of evidence about the evictions in Strathnaver
This party told you amongst other things that when he lived on the ground I now occupy the Sellars were burning there and he took his little brother on his back to fly away from these burnings
You could not know that he was living on the opposite side to that on which the burning was and if he flew down to the river he flew down to the burning party and not away from them which vitiated his whole evidence
He could not have been flying towards the river unless he had been flying towards the burning which was said to have taken place
No he was on the side where the burning was not going on
These recent improvements commenced some ten or twelve years ago and I myself was the first who proposed them
The Duke of Sutherland agreed to give us money at a certain rate of interest to improve the country
I laid a statement before his commissioner Mr Loch showing the amount of money spent in wintering sheep in Sutherland and Caithness which might be partly saved and partly spent at home and that to meet the difficulty he might on each farm take in a certain amount of land and plant a certain amount of timber to give labour to his people and at the same time to help this difficulty of sheep wintering because sheep farming was in a very prosperous state in those days and we could not foresee that things were to become less prosperous
Rents were rising in the low country people were beginning to keep their own stock and going into sheep breeding themselves which always rendered the difficulty of wintering our sheep greater and the more money we could save by raising turnips and provisions at home the more independent we would be of the low country farmers and the more money could be spent in the country and localised on home labour
The Duke of Sutherland through his commissioner at once agreed to this proposal and I may just remark that no agricultural society or chamber of agriculture has ever asked the Government for any terms such as the Duke of Sutherland has granted to his tenants of his own freewill
We have money at  percent interest
He makes the roads and houses free of expense
Of course the tenants very properly perform the carriage c
He gives us lime also at the same rate of interest which I dont think he ever charged
Nothing on the outlay
Two and a half per cent
Quite so
He provides money for drainage and fencing and trenching all at  per cent
The difficulty we have to contend with is the very poor soil when made and the cost is three or four times the price of reclaiming land in any other country
I can show you the difficulty of making land in that country for crofters
The Duke of Sutherland has tried it and utterly failed in planting crofters
You can no more make crofters by Act of Parliament or artificial means than you can introduce steam mills to grind oatmeal
When I say absolutely failed I speak in this way that the land he has made intending it for crofters cannot be let
Yes I believe his whole intention in making these improvements at Lairg especially was to make provision for small crofters
And from that downward but there is this other consideration
When the Duke of Sutherland and his managers found that they could not let these small farms which they had made at Lairg it led them to make the farms larger and to make the more recently made farms larger on account of the difficulty of letting the small ones before
See Appendix A LXIX
We first trench the land out of the natural moor at about  an acre
That is the contract price for  acres that I have been going in for
Yes by spade and going about  feet or  inches deep
Then we pay about  per acre for fencing and for draining the whole land  feet apart
As to stones we fetched such a tremendous quantity that it has cost   to   an acre to cart them off
It is put under regular rotation and kept sown
Quite so
Yes
Hand trenching most decidedly
There is no comparison whatever and I believe the cost is less
I am thoroughly sure of it
I am sorry to say that financially the improvements in Sutherland are not a success
That is because the land is naturally so poor
Perhaps I can grow the heaviest crops on the land of Seisgill and these crops cost as much as they are worth before they are made
I employ the best bones and manure in order to raise the fertility of the land and at the same time get crops out of it
I find it easier to grow good crop at great expense than to grow no crop at half expense so we consequently go the great expense
Yes tremendous use
I occupy two farms in Caithness and I have my sheep to drive for about fifty miles
Now having a certain quantity of land in Strathnaver attached to the sheep farm I can draw down a score or two of lean sheep once a week or when it is required whereas if I had to drive them down to Caithness fifty miles it would destroy the sheep and be an enormous expenditure
Four days driving down and four days up means a loss of four months keep in condition
I have got sufficient to save me a certain amount of expense but not the fourth part of what I require for the purposes of the farm
I grow  acres of turnips in Sutherland and about  or  acres of turnips in Caithness all of which are consumed by sheep and a certain quantity of cattle
Most decidedly and I think it is a perfectly proved fact that they have much too little land
The thing is perfect nonsense
It wastes their energies and their time and is a tremendous evil What I hold is that a man should have as much land as would keep a family and that the surplus population should be drawn off to the coast and independent fishing villages made there the same as on the Aberdeen and the Morayshire coasts
There is no more industrious or better class of people in the whole of Scotland than the Aberdeen fishermen are
They have the best boats of their own and plenty money saved and our Highlanders are just as good people as they are perfectly good labourers and perfectly good subjects in every way but they have no outlet for their energies
The other day I could not get a horse to hire
I found thirty carts waiting for fish from the nearest railway station and these fish are abused and destroyed in the carts
There is not a better coast in the whole of this country but the people cannot give it more than one day in the month for the want of harbours
Labour is so plentiful instead of being scarce that they can get any amount of employment
I did not say they were idle
Employed elsewhere
I have had them every way at from s to s a week working on days labour and I have also contracted for each work
We employed a contractor and he employed the people at a certain price and he paid them the same wages that we were in the habit of doing
Yes
Yes
Of course I should like to contract for it rather than do it on days wages but the people have been so unaccustomed to that work that they will not take it at a price per chain as we do in Caithness and again the difficulties of the ground are such that in that country you may get a piece of ground which is quite easily drained and you may get into another place where boulders meet you and every chain may cost more labour than half a dozen in another part of the country
So you cannot fix a price in that way
I have it on the best authority that this is what happened only last season in regard to the farm below me
There is not a more suitable farm in the whole Highlands for a club farm
There is a great extent of green land at least a much greater extent compared with black land than there is anywhere else in the countryand this would be a very suitable place for small crofters
They applied to the Duke of Sutherlands factor for an addition to their  holdings but they could not get the addition to their holdings because the dwelling house was on the part which lay nearest their holdings but they were offered the whole farm as a club farm if they could show a reasonable prospect of stocking it and paying the rent and there was no answer to that offer
No answer
A good deal more statement than you have time to listen to
For instance I should like to show you the state of the country and the causes of the evils which do obtain in the country
For instance would you like to hear how destitution cases are got up in our country
Well this happened only the other day
I happen to have been a member of the Parochial Board of the parish for five years
The Free Church minister of the parish is also a member of the board
I may tell you that our board is the most liberal board in Scotland
Mr Peterkin of the Board of Supervision has said that according to the rent and population we pay  more to paupers in our parish than any other parish with which he has to do
In the district iu which I reside we pay a stated sum of  a year to our doctor  from the Duke and  from each board and we actually have never had any destitution in our parish
To prove it in the month of March when the crisis was at the highest in other places we had just one extra case of application for relief at our board meeting
This was a case of a tailor who was also a crofter who applied for relief
He applied through the Free Church minister and urged his case as being a very necessitous one that his family were starving and that he was starving and that he had been at his house that morning begging for meal which he had got
Well it was no case for the Parochial Board
The man was a crofter and a tradesman and we would not put him on the board but we subscribed as much money among ourselves as bought a boll of meal to stave off the case in the meantime
At next meeting of our board I have the letter in my pocket we were very much surprisedI could use stronger languageto receive a letter from Mr James Macdonald WTS Edinburgh whose grandfather was the minister of the parish during the evictions and long afterwards
This letter enclosed another letter signed by this Free Church minister saying that there were seventythree cases of destitution in that parish and the people were in danger of dying of starvation and that the Parochial Board had refused to give relief to every one of them
Not one case of these seventythree came before us
Farr
Of course the chairman of the board wrote to say there was no destitution and no necessity for any money being sent there
After all that they got  from some society or other and that will show the south country people how their money goes in the Highlands
These are facts
I took action in this way that I asked the party if it was true and before a full meeting of the board we proved before his face the falsity of the statement and all his excuse when pushed into a corner  as that the tailors case was a test case for the other seventythree
Now there are no cases that come before a Parochial Board so that one case can be decided by another
I include the whole parish
That is not so
This work which I speak of had been lying undone several years simply for want of labour
The factor promised and repromised me to organise a staff of men and he told me the day before yesterday that he could not get them
Yes
The difficulty of getting labour is the same
If I want men even for harvest work or hay cutting I have to go to a neighbouring parish to get them
I had to do so this year
I required some men last week to drive stock and I could not get them
About eight miles
There is accommodation provided for them by me and they do not require to go back to their houses
There is Sire and there has been a large amount of work on the farm of Skelpick but in fact every farm has more or less work to do and plenty of it
Plenty of it but not to pay any rentI mean not to pay the rent which I pay or a sporting rent
Well there has been tremendous discussion going on about crofters paying larger rents than the large tenants
If you allow me to explain I think I can put it plain before you
I may say to begin with that my sympathies are totally with the people
I believe in the greatest good for the greatest number and my opinions on the land question are pretty advanced
I am to state the truth as far as I know it without bias and without regard to either side and I shall put you in possession of the facts of this question of crofters rents versus large tenants rents
The crofters of Farr I say have far too little land to keep their families and I shall be very glad to see them have more
And I may say the Duke of Sutherland is quite as anxious as anybody to enlarge their holdings on very much the same terms as he gives us and there is a scheme in prospect for this purpose
But in the meantime they have each on an average in that district four and a half acres of arable land and sixtyeight acres of hill pasture and the average rental of the whole is  s
Of course when they calculate the rent of their land comparing it with the large farms they forget that I have only one acre of green land to  I have  acres of land about the fortieth part of the whole county and on my hill grazing of  acres there is not over  acres of green land
The factor makes it  I make it  to be sure I am not understating it tliat is one acre of green land to  acres of black land
Now it is easy to make the rental of the crofters to be higher than hill grazings when you take four and a half acres of arable to sixtyeight of pasture put against one acre of green land to  acres of pasture
You had the most extraordinary statement the other night at Helmsdale that I ever saw in print acres of arable land in two parishes
Now you will be rather surprised when I state that the old evicted tenants in Sutherland did not leave over  acres of green land altogether in the whole county
Of course I am not speaking to a question of one hundred acres or so but still I will give you the basis of my argument and you can give it the credit it is worth
I occupy  acres of land which is a fortieth part of the acreage of the whole county which is about  acres
I have  acres of green land on that  Forty times  is  Now Strathnaver has ever been reckoned the finest strath in the county and the strath on which there have been most evictions and in which there has been most green land compared with the other land but when I multiply the  in my own holding by  it makes  acres of green land which was the quantity left by the small tenants
That is rather above the mark than below
On my neighbours farm which has more green land than mine I cannot exactly say the total extent of it but he has  acres of green land on a stretch of about twenty miles of strath
Then there is another farm
Three of us occupy the whole of Strathnaver minus the small farm now in the Dukes own hands and the small farm which I mentioned as offered to tenants and now let to a crofters son
Of course you have heard our friends public agitators who have been crying about the thousands of acres of land cleared in Strathnaver and so on
There has not been  acres of old cultivated land altogether from time immemorial
No
It is inferior now
If you put the crofters back to the green land which we occupy the debris of eighty years grass gradually being left unconsumed has added to the quality of the soil
The crofters lands unfortunately for them have been wrought for fifty years backpotatoes and corn and corn and potatoesso as to be exhausted
The land may have been better at first but now it is quite   inferior to these straths
It is inferior
The more you go into Sutherland the better the land becomes
It is better sheep land
No I do not say it is better for cattle because what makes good sheep pasture is not fit for cattle at all
Well that is theory
We have  the greatest difficulty just now in dividing the hill farms even in the way we work themthat is getting a certain proportion of ewe land to a certain extent of wedder land
The small tenants can perfectly well do with the strath and a pretty large proportion of hill pasture but when you come to a stretch of land eight or ten miles wide it becomes quite impossible for them to work it because if I was to plough up in my holding in Strathnaver even ten acres of green land it would destroy the hill pasture for sheep
We have so little green land to the extent of black land that actually one acre is missed
And that he could not make a proper use of the hill ground without the green land below
What could be done is this
We do not get above half the use of the land we occupy
Food is utterly wasted because the extent is even too great for us to occupy
We have thousands of acres of one kind of grass which the sheep never touch unless it is turnedthere is so much of it as compared with the green
If we had ten times the extent of green land that we have the sheep would eat the green land and eat this land along with it and we could keep more stock but we can ouly keep a certain amount of stock which can eat green land and then the hill land is lost because we have no green land
The whole recent improvements in my opinion have been a gross mistake
Yes
I am merely illustrating theone place by the other
The proper way to improve Sutherland would be to make fifty or one hundred acres of green land in any place where you can make  acres of black land available
There are places on all the hill farms in Sutherland here and there where by making fifty acres of green land you could make  or  acres of black land worth double the money
When you make  acres in one place it is all in one place and you cannot get the full extent of good off the black land
Yes but there is this difficulty that you have to keep your cattle on the green land in summer and if you eat up the green land with these cattle you starve the sheep in winter
I would not keep a single cattle beast even upon the green land I have on any terms
So they would not
Sutherland is not a place where the grass is knee deep
It is deer heather and heathery moss
It is a purely sheep country and nothing else
The way to make the crofters better is to get harbours made aloug the coast
There is not a harbour at present where a steamer could land between Thurso and Loch Inver and not even piers
There are one or two very safe places for harbour accommodation and you should make two places where a steamer could land and make piers at the fishing villages for the people to run their boats in when they are fishing and then draw down the half of the crofting population to these fishing centres and give the land which you take from them to the others and employ all the spare labour in trenching it more where it can be done
That is the only solution of the difficulty
Sutherland was never intended for a large population
The old minister of Farr
He died many years ago
He was one of those muscular Christians whom we find getting scarcer
Not profitably
Speaking of profitable occupation at the present time the Duke of Sutherland is paying more rates on account of these crofters than he is getting in from them
The rates all arise from the crofting population
There has been only one case in twentyfive years of a pauper coming off a hill farm on to the rates
The paupers all arise from the crofting population
That is not their fault by any means but still the fact remains and if you fill the straths again with these people in twenty or thirty years you would have the whole paupers of the country to keep and no rents from sportsmen to keep them with
I hold the crofters are well off in Sutherland now and I hold if you put them back to the straths you destroy them as fishermen and must give them large quantities of land to keep them comfortable
But they do like the sea
There is as good a class of men on that coast as in any part of the Highlands and men perfectly willing to fish and perfectly willing to work when they get the opportunity
But they really have not the opportunity
It is a most intolerable grievance the want of harbours
All along the Duke of Sutherlands propertythe northwest coast and this is a grievance which must be remedied either by the proprietor or by Government
The people cannot live without getting the benefit of the sea
It is the same all over Sutherland
There is no difference
You have more grass on ten acres in Skye thin upon fifty in Sutherland but we have ten times the quantity
Because sheep land is better
No
In Skye you have one sheep to one and a half acres
In Sutherland you require eight acres and the thinner you run them the better you make them
Dont overstock the ground
You must keep the stock so low that they can get a bite of green along with the hill grazing
Yes that is so but we do not get the use of that grass more than once in three or four years because it is so far out
In some parts of the country you get it near the green ground but in Sutherland I have to drive my sheep out for five miles to it and the first storm drives them in again
More in some respects than in Skye
We have as many sheep drowned in Sutherland as you have dying in Skye
You can easily understand it where half the country is sloughs and quagmires
No you did not see the worst of it
I dont believe he could
He might make small tenants
Well small tenants are quite right
One great evil in Sutherland is that we have no intermediate farms
We start from  up to  or  Now no country is in a safe state where that is so
There should be farms from   up to  and  There is no doubt in the world that our large sheep farms are quite unmanageable and unwieldy and the Duke would be pursuing a wise policythough it is against my interest by giving a tenant a hirsel of sheep
Let that be made a farm and so on or divide that perhaps into two farms
I have yet to find it
I do not believe in it
Anybody going through the county must see that the county was never intended by Providence for cultivation by a large population
It is a grazing county from beginning to end and cannot be made otherwise
The only way you can do justice to the crofting population is simply to make them fishermen and make every acre on the sea coast available and give these small tenants say ten acres of arable land and as much hill land as they can use
Then I urould insist upon getting a good class of boats and having a good breed of sheep and making the ground officers with assistance if they required it take charge of the accounts dividing the profits periodically
At present every man does what is right in his own eyes
A man having a right to put on fifty sheep may put on only ten
Another having a right to put on ten puts on fifty and the ground is sometimes overstocked and sometimes there are too few
Every man goes out after his own sheep and the sheep are disturbed and there is no good done
No I dont
Their rents are low and there is no povertyI mean destitutionamong them
You will have poor people always but still there are no hardships such as you find in Skye
They might but where are you going to end it
Yes but I tell you the Duke is paying more poor rate than he gets and if he goes on extending it he will be a pauper himself before long
That is so and where are they to get the stock
I advocate it so far that I say for myself that I will give the Duke of Sutherland up his land tomorrow if he gives me valuation for my stock and lets me out of it and I have my neighbours on both sides of me authorising me to make the same statement
We would be much the gainers by going out just now
If we hold on for three or four years we may lose thousands of pounds by the difference in the value of stock
So we are no obstacle in the way
There is nothing in the world impossible
I could divide my farm into a great many farms and put crofters on them perfectly well but they could not pay the rents
The fact is this that the shooting rents in our country are equal in value to the grazing rents
Whenever you put on crofters this as shooting ground is useless
That means doubling the grazing rents
Because the small tenants are eternally upon the ground and no game will lie upon ground well stocked with cattle and on which people are going at every hour of every day
Comparatively well off
They do not need to be reconciled
I said nothing of the kind
There is a great necessity for harbours
For the crofters and for the fishing population
The present fishing population and the population to be made fishers
No I am a native of Berwickshire or Caithness either of the two you like
Threethree too many at present and for the last seven years
I may say I did
I have unfortunately
I am not surprised and I would be only to glad if he got it
I am no enemy to the crofter
And what I would like to see him doing
But I would like to see how he is to get it
Well he can come down to Caithness and ask the proprietor for one and he can ask the Duke of Sutherland for the other
I am speaking for the whole of the north of Scotland
No
I appear here because Lord Napier at Bettyhill asked if there were any large farmers present and on the account of the great animus I saw displayed by the Free Church clergymen against large farmers and against the Duke of Sutherlands management throughout to which I can speak very well
I have a very great animus for I say the Free Church teaching and the Free Church clergy are the cause of half the evils that afflict Sutherland
I did
I approve of more but not in the way he said it
I have a perfect right to disbelieve it from my knowledge of the ground where he lived and where the burnings took place
He lives upon the Sellar side of the strath just now and there is no doubt of the fact
Dont come here and try to make me out a liar
I have given you my authority
I do not draw an inference I state a fact
I say the man lived on the one side of the river and the burnings were on the other side and he said he took his brother on his back to fly through the river and if his story is true he was flying  towards the burnings and that fact showed that the statement was worthless and the man is not much more worthy himself
Thomas
No I will not
Because the Duke of Sutherland has spent so much money in giving employment that every man who wants employment can get employment in half a dozen different places
I have lost more stock than I care to mention through sheep fulling into these open drains during the last three years and I cannot get men to fill them
I said nothing of the kind
I did not say from human habitation
I have plenty accommodation for labourers and I never asked a man to come without giving him accommodation
I have had as many as sixty or seventy men working for months on my own ground
I give them food also when they are in my own employment and I always keep plenty food about me
I have never less than  bolls of meal lying about the place and they are quite welcome to it
Is it right for west coast fishermen to go to the east coast seafishing and live for weeks out of their own houses
I never heard of it
There is nothing to hinder their staying at home but if I can give a man s a week and accommodation I do not think he is very hard up to leave home
He should be very glad to get it
Quite so
I have never heard of it
I did not say I dont know it
Yes I have heard the Duke say so himself
What do you mean by old reclamations
Yes go to Lairg and you will find plenty of cottages lying empty for want of tenants which the Duke made for crofters
He cannot get a rent for the land which will pay the interest of the money spent on the houses
He was asking a rent that would not pay interest on the money spent on the house
I am not the Duke of Sutherland fortunately
Say  to  crofts
Yes I do
I am speaking of the time when the reclamations were made
Perhaps since I was there the Duke may have turned these places into large farms and made labourers houses of these houses
That was the whole intention of the whole matter
When the Duke found he could not succeed at Lairg he altered his system at Kinbrace
I was there at a large meeting he called of his tenants and others and he distinctly said that was his object and more than that I saw him take letters from his pocket which he had received from Canada and other parts and he laid them before usfrom people who wished to get back to the soil possessed by their forefathers and he expressed himself as very wishful that it should occur and a very nice thing to do
I for one told him it was impossible to do it
Let me hear some cases of things in the good old times and among other things he told me this of a district which produced the best Highlanders in the Highlandsthe most respectable people there are to this daythat in his fathers time and they had been there for four hundred years on that land there was just one linen shirt in the district and when anybody went from home he got the use of that shirt and it was washed occasionally for the use of others
There is nothing like that now
Why in the parish where I come from there is  spent on tobacco and drink every year and  would have bought up the whole implements of the tenant stock lock and barrel three years ago
I have excise statistics in my pocket to prove that
We did the carriage which amounted to onethird of the whole but still these are very liberal terms on his Graces part because in Caithness we have to build the houses ourselves
He gives the whole but we pay the carriage the cost of which is onethird above the Dukes outlay
No more
There has been a great deal of money spent on crofters in improving their holdings and especially their houses but you see the same thing does not obtain on these crofts and upon hill ground where you have to make  acres perhaps at one spot and more than that the small tenant is not in a position in many instances to do it
Every acre which the Duke makes at an expense of  costs me  to bring into cultivation
Take a crofter that has three or four acres of land
It does not in the first place require draining it is generally dry land
You saw specimens of it at Betty hill and coming along the road
It does not require much draining
He can do nothing after that but employ more population in trenching out more land and adding to their crofts
I mean when each man has ten or twelve sheep on the hill and twenty or thirty people after them
Each man has his own sheep and is daily out among them
They take their cattle into the house at night and right out to the hill grazing through the day and every day is the same process and they are sometimes after their cattle and sometimes after their sheep
My own impression is though I dont know much about game that game are easily disturbed
I do and release it
Well that is my business
No not the slightest and I tell you I will give them my farm tomorrow if they give me value for the stock and perhaps they would have to give the Duke just a very little security for his rents
I would not have been so ready to do it and it has cost me  or 
No because I think if we knew our business we would retire and leave it immediately
I think every one is acting upon that and there is not a farm that goes out of lease that is relet and they are going out like doves out of their windows
Because agitators come among them and the Free Church  clergy have disturbed their minds and rendered them discontented and this Commission is going to make matters worse
The millennium
That will make us all right and I am looking forward to it
I have suggested a great deal and more than that if the Education Act is worked properly in the Highlands and the compulsory clause put into effect a generation will see the country clear of the surplus population without any trouble
The great thing is to arrange for the present difficulty and get the thing tided over because the Education Act will clear the country of the surplus population in twenty years because no young man will stay in the country after being educated
If he has a large sheep farm at a cheap rent
You will understand I am not in favour of emigration
I am not opposed to migration but I am opposed to emigration
I look upon that as the greatest evil that could befall any country and any people
No you were never more mistaken in your life
Allow me to state something to you
The Enclosure Commissioners for England and Wales published a few years ago their report which showed that out of  acres of land under cultivation in England and Wales there were only  acres drained
Supposing  acres of that land did not require drainage it leaves  to drain in England and Wales which at the lowest possible price of   or  per acre would need  of money which could be spent on British land and but for our unfortunate system of land laws would be spent
Now I say that  Highlanders sent down to the points where these drainage works could be undertaken and carried out are as comfortable and as valuable in a national point of view as if they remained in the Highlands and if we can grow wool and mutton in the Highlands to keep these people comfortable there I think migration is a very good solution of the difficulty
I oppose emigration because I think it would be as absurd as for a breed of horses or shorthorn cattle to be shipped off gratis to America or the colonies
I think human beings are of much more value than sheep and cattle and every man and woman raised in this country costs the country  before he or she is twentyone and every person we send out of this country to another is a dead loss to ourselves and adding already to the intense competition against us
It could not be more than that
Yes that is just the difficulty which I see
I know it so thoroughly that when I saw this statement made at Helmsdale I saw the thing was absurd
That does not include the whole green land because there are burns up through the country naturally green
There must be spots through the interior of the country which are naturally green
The water overflowing makes them so
I do not count that but I count the old cultivated land
It was and to show how I could not believe it I may say that there was near my house twentyfive acres of green land and I thought it was double the extent
I would not go so far as that but the people were in perfect misery in those days
There is no use talking about the good old times
They were under middlemenpeople who leased the land and sublet it to those people and there were perhaps  or  people in Strathnaver at the most populous time
If there was  acres the middlemen seized the best of it and kept it and how much was left for the people
I did because if it had not been done they would have starved
How then could the proprietor get his rent out of them
As regards the soil it is a very curious thing that in Sutherland there was scarcely one native who stood up against the south country invasion
Now in Caithness where I was born there were hundreds and hundreds of south country men who came in spending capital for ever and there was not one of them buried in the county except my father
Now the subsoil was clay and the people bowled the south country men over and sent them away wiser men
In Sutherland when the southern invasion came in the natives went down like nine pins and it was simply because the whole bottom is gravel
No but I say that wherever you find gravel you find superstition belief in the clergy and a high state of morality
Wherever you find clay you find the opposite
In Caithness we have clay but no gravel
In Sutherland illegitimacy is  or  per cent while down in Kirkcudbright for instance it is  per ceut
Whenever the land gets better they will not receive truth at second hand without seeking it for themselves and there is more intelligence and their morality is not so high
You have heard a great deal about the morality of the Highlands
The clergy have nothing to do with it
It is the soil that does it
It is as certain as possible
Take a geological map of Scotland and you find it perfectly  defined and I defy any man to get over it
We have proof
We had total disruption in the Highlands
No
I am only giving it as a theory
No and I give you this reason against it
The Duke of Sutherland required to hold out great inducements to men to come from the south who understood sheep and he could not get men to come without the largest inducement and no man would take land from the crofting population if there was a crofting population among them
He was a man who understood sheep farming and in the same category with the man from the Borders
When I speak of the Borders I mean strangers
He came from Morayshire as factor
Yes
There is nothing impossible
How it would work and pay the proprietor I cannot say because you cannot know until you prove it but I know it would be better for the country in the long run and better for the people
I know in Sutherland there is a great opportunity
There is a great deal of land falling into the proprietors hands and I know there is no man who is really more anxious to make things right than the Duke of Sutherland is
I do not say that
Sutherland is much the same all over
There is not much difference
You really cannot make a distinction
You have heard a great deal about fixity of tenure among tenants
Now the question should arise here this four and a half acres which the Thomas havewho made it
The tenants made it and I daresay they got no compensation for it and they have equal right to it
But then in Sutherland we have all fixity of tenure not legal or written but really by custom
The Duke never does put out a tenant if he can possibly avoid it
He has not paid the tenants compensation for these improvements but if he allows them to sit there at a nominal rent all along really he is compensating them by fixity of tenure
If a man expends  for improvement of land and the Duke pays  for improving it he will charge  and if he leaves him with it and pays nothing it is just the same
There never was any expenditure on hill farms till recently
There never was a shilling spent upon them by the proprietor and there did not need except perhaps for houses
I think you have all that stated in the documents the factor laid before you
I think so
In the parish in which I live the poor rate is d per pound and in some parts of Lewis it is s
In Lochs I think the poor rate is s per pound
Property is of very little value there
In twenty years it will be far less if it goes on
In Sutherland the difficulty was met and overcome in proper time
The difficulty in Lewis is the squatting population
The squatters who have no land settle down among the crofters
I think so
Yes
I do not say that I say as well off as crofters anywhere
Poor and school rates
It is as satisfactory as it is possible to make it and you would make it far more unsatisfactory
How can you have the whole county under big crofters
I tell you they have never been able to work the sheep trade and never will be able to make it pay
No because you cannot get green ground in the straths without destroying the value of the hill ground
Perfectly well
I paid about not so much nowabout  or 
Anything you like if you go down to the lowest strata
Yes I would
Well if you go in for any quantity of hill grazing you must go in for  or  You could have no hill stock unless you did
Much higher
By gravitation they would come out of these people
That is about the most fertile country in Scotland and the least subject to storms
It is the finest climate for grazing in the north and the finest land
You have that ridge of fine land which goes down through Scotland to the Lothian
And I will give you the reason for that
One acre in Orkney is worth twenty or ten at any rate in Sutherland
Now these people have the fishing as well
Well they have the finest land in the country
Not a  tenant not a crofter
That is a goodsized farm
Where would you draw the line in the crofter population
They will breed up again and the old state of things will go on again
It is the Church again
Every man in the Highlands is worth s or s to the minister and as long as the clergy are paid by the people their object is to keep the people there and stop education
Whenever the people clear out their vocation is done and there is no more need for them
I say they are well off now
Any one can see that Sutherland was never made for a big population
How can they be but well off with the Duke spending a million of money among them and when they have the sea beside them
Talk of the Sutherland crofters being ill off compared with Skye and Lewis there is no comparison whatever
There is no depth there
I assure you the people are comfortable
Of course we all wish to see them better off but as crofters I think it is a wrong system to have men located upon less land than will keep a family
I wish to make crofters crofters and fishermen fishermen
I have no objections
Of course I am simply giving my opinion
I do not believe it could be done
It could be done perhaps to keep the people but the land could not pay a rent to the proprietor
If you mean Government to buy the stock you may force it that way
But that is like handloom weaving it must come gradually
It is but what is the cause of it
When the great inflation of wool and sheep took place during the American war when wool rose to three times its value and sheep were very high we gave the whole profit back to the proprietor in the shape of excessive rents
But then you do away with the proprietors
They need all they have to live upon and if you reduced the rents to a minimum you would soon have them off the face of the earth
They would be the worst  off crofters on the property
I think it is impracticable
The fact is that Sutherland could not be wrought much differently than it isthat is with men having  sheep up to but when you come down to the small tenants it is a very difficult question
I daresay it would but then look again at this
Up at Kinbrace corn will not ripen
You have fifteen or twenty miles not worth d or d per acre
How are you to do in a country like that
You cannot break up the large farms to make the present crofters possessions larger
Well if you could make them into  farms I have no objection but less than  would not do
I suppose it might
You are asking me a very queer question for a man making his living the opposite way
As I said ten years ago in another public inquiry I am perfectly prepared to submit to any change of circumstances for the benefit of the people
I have spent a vast deal of money among them in labour and I am prepared to do more in the same way and would like to see them better off in every way
If I was a proprietor I would not attempt to restock the country with small crofts
Well they are on the coast already
What I propose is this that if these harbours were made by Government they might give these harbours and make it a proviso that the proprietor should give those people houses in fee simple or on long lease and give them a bit of garden ground and make them perfectly independent of the crofting
Give it to the nearest neighbour
Certainly it would
They would have double the land
I would make every one of these crofters left from the fishing population small farmers
Most decidedly
I would give them as much land as possible
Let them go as far as they like
The other day when the committee were fixing sites for these bridges we fixed the site of a bridge close to the house at Bighouse and the reason of fixing it there was that it was convenient to a natural harbour quite within a quarter of a mile of it
It would be a simple matter to make a road from this road to the harbour
That was one reason why we fixed it there and it was at the suggestion of the Duke of Sutherlands factor which shows they have it in their minds to erect harbours
That is one place
Yes
Then there is another splendid situation for a harbour opposite Tongue and there is another place where vessels can lie on the beach just nowthat is Tarrasdale
Then you have Loch Armadale which is a very sheltered bay at present and where a harbour could be made
I may mention one thing more
There has been a great deal said about tyranny and persecution and so on on the part of the officials towards the small tenants
Now I had a pretty long controversy with Mr Mackay of Hereford in the public prints last spring and every letter he wrote he charged the Duke and his officials with tyranny and oppression of every kind
It was not my province but as I was in the discussion I offered to send an honest lawyer to investigate the cases if he gave me from two to six cases and oblige myself to hold the information secret as his reason for not giving the cases publicity was a fear that the Duke or his factor might turn the people out for giving information
I gave him the challenge and asked him to produce two cases or any number up to six on these conditions and what I got in answer was unlimited personal abuse
Now in the Tongue district there are between  and  crofts all managed by one factor and two ground officers and the grievances you heard at Bettyhill were the worst cases they could bring forward no doubt as showing mismanagement and there has not been one eviction in that district for twenty years
I do appear as a delegate for the very best of reasons
There are no men left in my part of the country that had the courage to come and tell what their experience was in my time and they told me to come on their behalf from Strathglass to give the story about the glens there
A list of Glencannich men who held commissions in Her Majestys army in my own time  Colonel James Chisholm born at Lietrie died at Fasmakyle Strathglass  Lieutenant Archibald Chisholm born at Lietrie died at Gambia Africa  Major James MacLean born at Carrie died at Boulogne France  Captain Rory Maclean born at Carrie died in United States America  Ensign Duncan Maclean born at Carrie died at Isle of Wight  Ensign Colin MacRae born at Carrie died at Sierra Leone  Ensign Angus Macrae born at Carrie died at Sierra Leone  Colonel Alexander Chisholm born at Mucrack died at Alexandria Canada  Colonel James Chisholm born at Mucrack died as Governor of Gold Coast Africa  Captain Valentine Chisholm born at Mucrack died at Inverness  Lieutenant Angus Chisholm born at Mucrack died at Cape of Good Hope  Ensign John Chisholm born at Mucrack died at Comar Strathglass  Lieutenant Christopher MacRae born at Invercannich died at Gambia Africa  Lieutenant Theodore MacRae born at Invercannich died at Stray Strathglass  Ensign Finlay MacRae born at Invercannich died at Gambia Africa  Ensign William Macrae born at Invercannich died at Inverness  Lieutenant John James Chisholm born at Invercannich killed at Quatre Bras
Fortyone years
It has been the case with me
Just so
Of much value I consider
I told you I saw comfortable and happy families there and I see no reason why there should not be  so again
It forms the outer glen of a forest
The one I described was the inner glen
Yes
Yes
I think Glenstrathfarrar was cleared before the father of the present Lord Lovat was born
Yes why not
Large fields of arable land are laid waste there
Perfectly well
What is the good of mentioning their names
They are dead and in heaven before now
Yes
In
I dont recollect them
I was in England at the time but I was very sorry when I saw the account of its being sold
Quite soevery syllable of it
I cannot tell why but he may have had reasons
He was twentyfive before he was allowed to sell and during that time the estate of Guisachan was actually under the trusteeship of Colonel John Chisholm who died lately and Colonel Kyle Aberdeenshire
 s
No but I am confident there are plenty in Inverness that had an idea of it for Colin Chisholm solicitor was the agent at the time
I hear that but I know nothing of it
I never was on the estate since he bought it except once I was there on a message from a party in America ten or twelve years ago
I think if it were in the hands of the old tenantry it would have risen much more than 
Except a baker a shoemaker a blacksmith a chaplain and a grocer that are valued at 
I heard that but rents and these things are not in my line
I look at things as I saw them at one time and I meditate upon them as I now see them
That is my way of thinking
I do know something about it
I have been there repeatedly and in my boyhood I used to be back and forward
Yes I have been there not long ago some two years ago
I am sorry to say they are
I hear men who know the country say that it is turning the country back to a state of nature entirely
I daresay I would go there if I were allowed to go through the forests but you dare not go through one of them
If you pass off the bridle path you are in danger of being collared and I dont know what after that
I will give you an instance of that
Quite soheather and wood growing instead of grass
I consider it is very wrong
If you lose hope of the men now in possession go to the Legislature
Try themselves first and see what you can get out of them
If they are not able to manage their own affairs go to the Legislature at once
I cannot tell you of any benefit whatsoever
I told you that I have seen cattle and sheep reared there that fetched some of the highest prices at Falkirk market and how can it be otherwise than injurious to the country to have such masses of land thrown vacant that will not rear a cow or sheep for the benefit of the community at all
I believe that is the true state of their case
Yes
I have grave doubts of the wisdom of being satisfied with it
I think it is a serious a palpable and an unpardonable state of things
And long before that
Yes published and spoken everywhere I could be heard and listened to against the system
Yes
I believe every crofter and every one who wants land would be benefited by themby having more land
The man that wants more land and is able to pay for it let him have it
With regard to the estate of the Chisholm I can simply say this that if you look at the state of the country now beginning at the watershed of the Glen of Guisachan the estate is about fifteen miles long beginning at the watershed and beginning again at the boundary of the Chisholm the march between himself and Mackenzie of Kintail again in Glencannich and again between Matheson and Lord Lovat you might as well say that a dragnet was drawn round the whole of these glens and the people brought down to the level of the strath until they found a harbour on Lord Lovats estate
With respect to Sir Alexander Matheson he is an excellent landlord to me but I cannot conceal from myself that I saw a great deal of what I considered real misery on his estate in other parts
In Strathglass from one end to the other you will not find one crofter at all they cleared them out so thoroughly
The people would suggest it themselves
Give them good terms and you will soon have plenty people to suggest it
That is your business
Advertise the farms and offer your terms and you will see people come and accept them
I mean the people ought to have the chance of the land but take your own way of giving it to them
A few landlords rent the Highlands will they be able to rectify that
If not let them go to the Legislature at once
Well in the first place I must tell you that I consider the landlord is the aggressor and the sinner that cleared the people out I leave him to make amends or to say he is not able to do it and let the Legislature do it for him
If he comes to ask my advice I will give him my best advice
By simply offering the land on conditions that will be lasting you will find plenty people to come and be offerers
They are not in Strathglass and how can I tell you where they will come from
That would be the wise plan
Well I dont think the people wish him to live for ever
I dont know
In my early recollection we never expected such a man and as long as you leave the laws of the land as they are and the greed of landlords as it now is you may have plenty of Americans Frenchmen Russians and any other men
It is not at all likely that Great Britain will allow such masses of land to remain in possession of a man that does no good with them and I do not think they would be left consolidated as they are
I am not sure but there are plenty of them
There are other men without consciences in the world as well as Mr Winans
I dont know but it is a very cruel one in our estimation here
Part of the glens were formerly under deer but there has been a vast deal of good grazings cleared for him
For Mr Winans purposely
Well I wish you would not ask me that question but I will answer it
First and foremost Mackenzie of Kintail and then Sir Alexander Matheson
There is a very small portion of the Chisholms land cleared for him
The proprietors are in the first place to blame and he is to blame for straining the law to have every soul and every beast cleared off the land for him so that the blame must be divided in his case between himself and the landlord
The proprietor by all means
He has the power of turning that land to the very best purposes for cultivation or for grazing or for feeding and the landlord who deprives himself of all power over his land seems to me to be more guilty than the man who takes it
That is my view of it
Certainly not
Not the least
Ach I dont like his butchering style of killing game at all
Gathering the poor animals together and driving them before the muzzles of the gun
You might as well send an elephant after them to stalk them
I have not heard of one before
Too many in the opinion of the men who travel round the groundtoo many by half
You cannot go within half or quarter of a mile without meeting a watcher watching whether you go off the road
I was cautioned about going off the road a little distance to some good springs to take a drink of cold water and to show you the humanity of such a system I knew an instance of a Glasgow artist and naturalist who took lodgings for a few days at Cannich Inn and by mere instinct or some other way he went up and took himself out of the sight of this public house and when the man found himself in sight of a beautiful clump of heather he started a number of little flies small and large and the misfortune was that this great sportsman saw him from the hill
He sent a man down brought him before him and I dont know what he threatened to do for robbing him of his midges
The result was that when the Glasgow man got himself on the Queens highway there was a battle of very high words and the people present thought it would end in heavy blows and they were prepared to save lives on either side
The flies were dead but the Glasgow man took every one of them to the road and then he told Mr Winans that he was not pleased with him at all and it was very nearly coming to the greatest battle we ever had in Strathglass for an agethe battle of the midges
That is an instance of the humanity and an instance of the hospitality of these glens owing to your great sportsman
He must get them from other glens
We have no men in that country and he gathers them from round Lochaber between the land of Lochiel and Sir Kenneth wherever he can get them
I think not as a rule and this much I must say for Mr Wiuans that I believe he pays every one he employs remarkably well
I believe some of them would come from America if there were fair conditions and leases similar to my lease from Sir Alexander Matheson to the end of time
Indeed they are and in Australia
Plenty deer
Upon the high ground and on the low ground occasionally
Yes
Not a bit of it
That would be the true
No I dont and if there was a difficulty let the proprietors who actually divested themselves of the men and sent them out of the country send and get them back again
By all means
They have the inheritance left by their fathers good and bad and let them mend what their fathers did wrong
Yes I wish to supplement a statement I made at Loch Alsh
In giving my evidence at Loch Alsh on the nd August I was asked how much of the  laid out by Sir Alexander on improvements for tenants on his west coast estates was for the benefit of crofters paying under  of rent
While my examination was going on the papers were put into the hands of an assistaut who unfortunately summed up one branch only amounting to  odds
The correct sum is however  s d of which  s was laid out for  of the larger crofters making an average of  s d for each and  s d for  crofters occupying smaller holdings making an average of  s d for each
For th large amount expended Sir Alexanders return is merely nominal since the rent roll shows an increase of only  s d on the rents of  large crofters and a decrease of  s d on the rents of the  smaller crofters thus making the nett increase only  s d equal to s d per cent for the outlay of  These figures need no comment
They plainly show that Sir Alexanders desire is to benefit his people
I regret however to say that all of them do not show corresponding gratitude
In my former evidence I mentioned the system of division of property which Sir Alexander advocates and acts upon and I take this opportunity of stating the success of this system on his estates in Easter Ross
Leaving out the estates of Balintraid Delny Obsdale Culcairn and Millcraig though conspicuous by the great improvements made upon and additions to them there is but little change in the number of large farms and crofts but on the rest of his estates in Easter Ross purchased from the Duke of Sutherland in  the change is remarkable
When he came into possession in  the lands were occupied by twentysix tenants one tenant paying  one  one  one  six from  s to  s and sixteen crofters from   to  In a few years the whole was remodelled all the improvable lands brought under cultivation farm steadings erected roads made and large portions judiciously planted in a word the whole district so beautified as to be the admiration of every visitor and the lands occupiedbesides the home farmby fortyfour tenants of whom one pays  six from  to  sixteen from  to  thirteen from   to  and eight from  to  But what I wish to notice specially is the manner in which he dealt with the large farm which paid a rent of  Considering it too large a holding in the possession of one person in  he bought up the remaining years of the lease and without occupying your time in giving details of progress I at once state that in a few years it was occupied by one tenant now paying  one  one  nine from  to  twelve   to  and six from  to  thirty in all and comfortable in their respective positions
Six of the above tenants occupy one club farm and two another
Thirty
The extreme west portion of this large holding called Dibidale he partially forested and partially kept in his own hands as a summer grazing for sheep it being too subject to severe winter storms to be occupied by a tenant
In  the last resident tenant was starved out and a shepherd who herded there from  to  told me that the place was restocked thrice during the time the Duke was proprietor the severe winter having destroyed the sheep
They died out the severe winter storms having destroyed the sheep
Dibidale at Ardross
The sheep all died out with the storms and had to be three times restocked in twelve years
That is the shepherds information that he had to purchase hundreds and put them on three times during the twelve years
I may say to confirm it that the gamekeeper who is there now to my knowledge within the last five or six years during very severe winter storms drove the deer that are there now from the low ground as quiet as a herd of sheep they were so reduced by the winter stormthe snow perhaps four or five feet deep and sometimes ten feet in some parts
And Sir Alexander finding the portion in his own hands unprofitable forested the whole in  There is also an outlying portion of the estate situated to the north of Ardross named Amatuatua which he has reclaimed and on which he has erected new buildings twenty years ago occupied by nine tenants as a club farm paying rents from  to  and one paying  All Sir Alexanders crofters on his east cost estates being industrious are comfortable
It is arrangements similar to the above that Sir Alexander is desirous to carry out on his west coast estates
His property in Loch Carron he has got organised where there are one tenant paying  one  two in a club  each nine in a club  s each nine in a club average of  s each eight individual holdings from  to  four from    s to  and one a nominal rent of s
Loch Carron
They exist now
 The first is of those who seldom reason at all but do and think according to the example of others whether parents neighbours ministers or who else they are pleased to make choice of to have an implicit faith in for the saving of themselves the pains and trouble of thinking and examining for themselves
The knowledge of agriculture among the crofters is far behind the age
To remedy this evil it might be worth the consideration of proprietors to select energetic natives on their respective estates whom they would get trained in the theory and practice of Highland farming to be ground officers who would have constant supervision over crofters till trained
On the west coast they have to contend with climatic changes which are not experienced on the east coast so that the same practice is not applicable to both
Squatting is a great evil and often a source of annoyauce in the management of Highland property
No one should have a possession without paying rent however small
Last Whitsunday an occurrence took place which put one of Sir Alexanders farmers in a fix
Not having a ploughman with a family he allowed a labourer to occupy the house intended for his ploughman but having engaged a married ploughman previous to Whitsunday last the labourer was in due form summoned to remove and another house in the neighbourhood offered to him with materials free to repair it
He told me in presence of his minister that he would remove without having been summoned but I observed with a shade of that obliquity above referred to and when on the term day the ploughman came the squatter would not move leaving the farmer to do what best he could with his servant
In many instances if attempts he made to stir up the people and better ways of management introduced they are looked upon as innovations and frequently go under the name of oppression and in some instances though they see rules introduced to be for their benefit they can scarcely realise their position in making breaches upon them
I give an example
Last spring circulars were issued to all Sir Alexanders west coast tenants who have hill grazings for their guidance in heather burning with which all as far as I am aware complied but on two farms on opposite sides of an inland loch fires occurred about two weeks after the last day allowed by law for heather burning
I believed then and do so still that both the farmers were innocent and that the fires were lighted at the instigation of some one with evil intentions but though I am on terms of intimate friendship with both to show by example that favour would not extend to any one in an open breach of law I instructed Sir Alexanders solicitor to write them
One who is an educated gentleman and not a native replied at once freeing himself and his servants and regretting he could not discover the incendiary the other who is a decent honest man but a native never troubled himself to reply even though I personally advised him to do so
The more I study the state of the Highlands the more I see of the wisdom of Sir Alexanders plan which may be summed up in there being a judicious gradation of holdings and no more people in a district than can earn their livelihood by their industry
On Sir Alexanders east coast estates no one thinks of coming to ask a piece of land
They have the common sense to see it fully occupied
They follow the example of the busy bee when the hive is too full it swarms the young people go away
In the valley in which Ardross Castle is situated the population was under  when the estate came into Sir Alexanders possession
It very soon became populous but not beyond a manageable number
In the first class school he established there I saw  children present at an examination and through the means of the sound education and industrious training they got Ardross boys are now to be found in almost all parts of the world in positions of trust
Last July over a dozen young mechanics and labourers left for Queensland in high spirits
A number of youths who have been well educated in the Lochalsh district also have gone abroad are a credit to their country and send encouraging reports to their friends
If the same spirit could but be put into more how great a benefit it would be to themselves and to those they would leave behind
No it was a case where the place could be broken up but there is no other large holding that could practically be broken up
My knowledge does not extend beyond that under my own charge
Well he has not gained by it
I was not prepared with figures but I know that the return he has cannot be  per cent because I do not think that the breaking up of large farms will in any way benefit the proprietor
It must be looked upon as the work of a philanthropist
Yes I would
Yes
Yes in those that he has not got properly organised because there are a good many there who cannot gain a living by the land and consequently to make them comfortable two or three holdings ought to be put together to make one comfortable
Yes that is what I would like to see
Yes
Yes what I mean is that those who would make their living by the land would as far as possible have no other employment but the land and those who would make their living by fishing would have only as much land as might keep them at home and yield the grazing of a cow and a few sheep and let their income be principally from labour either as fishermen or as artizans
Yes
Yes
No they will not live there
That gentleman did not know Rossshire at least he did not know a Rossshire farm
Yes
I have no doubt of that because experience shows that an educated young man will not remain there
He will think for himself and when he begins to think for himself he finds it is folly to remain at home and that it is best for him to go abroad and support himself and be a help to those who remain behind
Well I cannot speak from facts for I dont know them
Well I cannot answer directly because I do not know them
Of that I have no doubt but I thought you referred to its being done upon other estates
I have no doubt of that being the right one 
Well if that could be doneif it were practicableit would be a wise thing to do but the question is how can it be done
The proprietor would have to go to the cost of erecting buildings and making perniauent roads
They could not improve the lands themselves
He would have to improve them for them and it requires a large amount of capital to do so
Yes if they had the means to do it
Oh no
I have no doubt of it for I have seen it for thirty years
Of course they have it but not to the same extent
Yes
What I mean by saying uneducated Highlanders have a strong attachment to localities is that they cannot realise what it is to leave either for their own benefit or the benefit of others but I believe that every person has a strong attachment to the place of his birth
No I mean people sitting down without paying rents at all
We have  of them who pay no rents
I cannot say for any outside our own property but when Sir Alexander Matheson bought the property he found squatters on it
To make them pay a rent however small even Is
They would then be tenants and would be manageable
If you do it just now Mr Mackenzie the Clach would rise up against us and a good many other people and say we were oppressors
To the extent of Is
They would not pay because with the present agitation that has arisen in the Highlands Highlanders I may say in many places have become quite unmanageablethey are so difficult to deal with
Yes I have been thinking of getting strangers in amongst them but I know from the habits of the people and their mode of thinking that they would not suffer any strangers among them
To use a Gaelic word the  macharach is looked upon as an oppressor among the native Highlanders
They hate him
The same feeling exists in those unbroken parts of the Highlands as it did  years ago
I may explain the best plan to get them trained is that proprietors should get some of the native people intelligent men among the natives educated to agriculture and farming as applicable to the Highlands and the people would take instruction from them with much more ease than they would from a stranger
Yes
Yes
Yes they would all have an equal interest
The way Sir Alexander does with the arable land they occupy is that they rent it separately and then the club is rented in common and each pays a proportion of the grazings added to the rental of the low ground
We are now speaking about the Highlanders
No but I say he gives other miscarriages than those two but they are so applicable to the present state of matters that I could not resist giving them
Yes the extent of it is about  acres
The only one
Yes I dont think it is so much as I have stated
I would rather not say the figures I dont think it is
Well among them was one of my own sons and I felt in high spirits that he was so plucky as to go
He went away in June and in the following July fourteen followed him to Queensland and I was in high spirits to see him so plucky as to go and my eldest son wants to follow him immediately
Yes
They can answer for themselves
I cannot answer for others
Yes
It is better for both
It is better for those who remain behind because they can have enough to live upon by their industry and better for those who go away because there is plenty room in the world outside their little home and it would be far better for them to exert themselves for their own benefit abroad than at home
Certainly not
The people who remain behind
That depends on circumstances but one thing unfortunately is that the good will go away and the bad remain behind
I have done so because I have experience of it
Yes
Yes I do
I believe it is so
Yes because they are not elevated as they ought to be
They want elevation
No it is natural for him to have such a feeling
Well it is objectionable in one way because so long as he remains there he will be a burden to himself and to others but if he had the moral power to go away he would be a benefit to himself and a relief to others
It is the raising of the moral nature the elevating of the moral character that would make them think for themselves
I do because they would return to their own country independent and assist others and remain at ease after their hardearned labourliving upon their previous industry and supporting others
Yes coming back not a burden to their country
Yes
As far as I remember three have come back to Ardross after making a competency
They came back from Australia
Yes perhaps all his lifetime
Oh perhaps not after his death he would think no more about it
I dont know
I dont know the history
I know there would be a very great benefit to the people themselves if half of them went away
They know it themselves too but they dont think of moving
Two or three of them early this year spoke to me about going away if they got assistance but when matters were coming to a point they would not go
Sir Alexander assisted a few privately and they sent home very encouraging reports and one thing I may tell to show that they are getting on well abroad
There was one young man to whom he give a loan of  two and a half years ago to take him to India and I am glad to say he has returned the money
Another poor man to whom he gave  about ten years ago went away and he has returned the money
He could not get anything to do at home
Because there was nothing for him
He was a lad of seventeen and a half and had the pluck to go away at that age to India
There is not an opening
You may see from the advertisements that there is not a single opening but perhaps twenty thirty or forty are applying for it which shows that the number of people in need of employment is in excess of the available employment
No it cannot be when such is the case
Yes
I am sorry to say I did not refer to the valuation roll
It is slightly above but not much
Yes
A very large outlay
In the whole of these improving the land reclaiming it from nature and building houses and making drains
He constructed the houses entirely himself and for their steadings he gave the materials
That is in the case of the small holdings
Stone and lime
Two chimneys and some larger
Not a penny
Nothing
Nothing
When he built them labour was much cheaper than it is now and probably some of these houses would cost about  on the west coast
A similar house now would cost  on the west coast
Well on the east coast about 
Yes
Yes it could
Yes he could by the proprietor contributing a certain amount of assistance and the tenant doing the labour and perhaps contributing a sum towards the expense of the house
Yes
Yes in the most of them
In the very small holdings paying from  to  there are only boundary fences made by the proprietor and they make the subdivision fences themselves
They get wood and make the subdivisions themselves
Yes
Posts and wire
Yes the posts are given free
No I could not mention the figures
It is now still occupied on one of the farms
Yes the one that pays  There is one still paying 
Yea
Very satisfactory and the admiration of every one who goes to see it
There you find an example if circumstances would permit of what a Highland property not highly situated could be converted into
I will send a statement of that to the Commission
Yes
Yes
I may mention that the population was under  when he got the estate
He picked out a few
That valley includes all his large farm and there were no other occupants on the large farm except in this valley
A few from his own estate because the crofters who were there at the time he bought the property outside this farm are there themselves still or their descendants and then he had to introduce picked men from other places
They were all picked and that is what made it so successful
No the smaller holdings were first made for labourers and for people who were not in very good circumstances to make them more comfortable and then in  he tried the first experiment of a club farm
Till  part of the grazing of this large farm was in his own hand and in  he broke it up into a club farm occupied by six tenants
That was his first experiment in club farms and finding it so successful though they were picked men and knew their work he extended it to other parts of the property
No
No
No not equally satisfactory
Yes it has
The reason is that there are no people introduced there but the natives and it is so difficult to stir them up to see what is for their own benefit
They will not take very good care of what the proprietor makes for them but allow it in many cases to go wrong and then when things go wrong they call again upon the proprietor to rectify what they allowed to go wrong
Yes
Yes fully a third greater
Such is the case but I consider that in saying a third
Yes that is what I mean
An average of 

Yes
The rental is now 
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes and he was getting 
Yes
No it was not all waste land
Before he expended the money the rental was about  barely  and now it is  so there is only  of increase
Yes leaving  to meet the old rent
It was not on the west coast crofts that he erected the buildings it was on the east coast
He got the houses when the property was bought
The houses were there except a few new ones that he built
In Loch Carron he built over a dozen new houses and got that place organised
In improving lands and building houses for about a dozen of them
Yes
No
Draining trenching ploughing and fencing
Yes there is one large farm he broke up
Sallachy
It was mentioned in my previous evidence
No I think the rent would be about the same for sheep farms increased in value within the period since he bought the property and now they are falling back again
No I think they are about the same
Yes
About onefifth more
I do
Yes there are two reasons
One is that they are quite a distinct race
They have not the same intermixture of Scandinavian and Saxon blood on the west coast as on the east coast
Yes
Another reason and the principal one is that they are kept so much to themselves they do not mix up with people on the east coast to gather information
They do not associate except among themselves and consequently they cannot acquire so much knowledge
A great deal
Yes and creates more lassitude and consequently they cannot work so well
There is not so much animation about them
I am not acquainted there
Well I am not acquainted with them
I was only once in the Lewis
Yes
I have no written statement
I was merely asked to corroborate the statement that was presented by the first witness Charles Mackay
I am of opinion generally that if the crofters throughout the Highlands had more land and security of tenure that is to say that they would be in no apprehension of removal in their ordinary circumstances they would produce far more out of their crofts and that they might perhaps devote their attention to the production of various other things from their holdings
Yes
I might draw your attention for one instance to the large quantities of eggs imported into this country from other countries and there is a very large quantity of eggs sent from the Highlands to the southern markets besides what is consumed at home
I think that even in this matter alone the production of eggs throughout the Highlands might be very much increased so much so indeed that I think an ordinary crofter with a small holding might possibly pay his rent nearly from eggs alone
From calculations I have been making I do not give them as very accurate but they are satisfactory to my own mind I believe that throughout the Highlands taking the mainland apart from the islands perhaps upwards of  worth of eggs is produced
I do not connect it with security of tenure I rather connect it with the increase of the number of smaller holdings
Yes
Poultry and other things
Partly from the produce of the farm and partly from purchased articles
No I dont know that it would be to devote himself particularly to it except as an accompaniment to other things
Yes I understand they have
I may mention I had a communication from a firm in Ireland who have devoted considerable attention to pork curing and pork rearing and I have had inquiries about what the prospects would be of starting an industry like this in some part of the west coast and among the crofting population
I understand they have
Not so much
No not in this locality but I have heard it repeatedly said that the small holders might with considerable advantage devote considerable attention to the rearing of market produce
Not personal
I have
I was
I cannot say as to the acreage but I know crofts where say two or three cows and a horse are kept and where the family seem to be comfortable and contented and where they rear respectable families
In cases which have come under my notice the members of the family with perhaps a little outside assistance are able to cultivate the croft
Yes
I cannot say for that
I am of opinion that the extent of land at present under deer might with advantage to the country and to the people be cut up into small holdings and I also think it would be for the interests of proprietors themselves and for the country that the land at present under large sheep farms should be cut up into small holdings
I would think it would be quite a proper matter for the Legislature to interfere with the deer forests and to restrict them at all events or cut them up
I cannot say personally that I would
I would not have them to interfere to that extent
I have an opinion myself that it would be more for the interest of proprietors themselves to have a large number of smaller welltodo tenantry on sizes of crofts where they could be comfortable than to have very large farms that are sometimes thrown upon their hands
Well I dont know many cases where they are but I strongly suspect they must surely come to be
Yes I rather think so but I would be inclined to have some indication from the Legislature that it would be necessary in the interests of the people
Well they have got over very great difficulties in the legislature of the country and probably if you accept the principle I think they might get over that
I would like to say for myself and many others who are associated with me in this matter that I disapprove of the references that have been made by Dean of Guild Mackenzie to Dr Mackenzies management of the estate of Gairloch during his time
I do not wish to contradict it in any way because I am not a native of Gairloch or acquainted with the circumstances of the case but I simply express my opinion from Dr Mackenzies wellknown character in this community and throughout the country for many years his great age and his present state of health that we cannot approve of the references made to him when he is not in a position to explain them personally
That is all I wish to say with reference to that matter
I have been in Inverness for twentyfive years and in business for about seventeen years
I have heard so repeatedly and cases have come under my notice where parties who had some connection with land in the country have ultimately come to be paupers in the town of Inverness
I believe it will be found so now but if you examine the roll fifteen or twenty years ago you will find far more numerous cases in that connection
That is so
No
I do certainly
Decidedly so
That is my experience
Yes to encourage them rather than emigration
Well I do think so
No I have not
Yes there is but I think it is particularly so in the Highlands
No I have not ascertained that from comparison of the poor rates but from various other sources I am perfectly satisfied that it is sofrom the opinions so freely expressed by those who ought to know something about the matter
That may be so
Yes
Speaking for merchants generally throughout the town I may say that we depend very largely upon the permaneut rural population throughout the country
There are one or two individuals in the town who devote their attention to the applying of shooting tenants but I think this of itself is decreasing nowthis department of tradebecause I am informed by those merchants who do that sort of business that the shooting tenants coming from the south supply themselves very largely with what they require from large stores in London and other large places and bring all the supplies with them which they used twenty or thirty years ago to buy in Inverness so we are perhaps less than ever dependent upon these people
I think it would be fully made up if there was substituted for it the custom arising from the people who would settle down upon the land that they have now
I was referring to deer forests
From the changes that are proposed I do not suppose for a moment that the tourist traffic in the Highlands would decrease
I think it would increase because the country would be much more open to them than it is now because you have restrictions here and there that are rather a barrier to tourists
Yes I do
Certainly there has been a great deal of benefit derived from those shooting lodges and their surroundings
I should think so
It must have done so
Undoubtedly in very many ways
Exactly
Yes
Yes but they require more than Highland tweeds
Yes from the Highland Land Law Reform Association
Yes
The object of our association is to endeavour by constitutional means to bring about a better system in the occupancy of and for the improvement of the land in order that the people may be enabled to live comfortably on the land by their own industry as was the case in former times and not be compelled to emigrate to foreign countries or crowd into towns where their chances of living are much more precarious than in the country and thereby sap our country of its vitality and its greatest wealth
While we would not in the least interfere with voluntary emigration such as was taking place at all times since our colonies were discovered or acquired we are convinced that there is a great deal of land formerly tilled in our own country ready for the spade and the plough and capable of  maintaining a large rural population and also benefiting urban populations and if rest is beneficial to it it has had it some thirty or forty some even eighty years rest
We also know that there are large tracts of improvable land in many parts of the country now comparatively valueless that could be made productive and valuable to both landlord and tenant if the latter got encouragement to improve and security for improvements it would prevent our country from being impoverished by being drained of the best and ablest of the people away to cultivate land in other countries and of our money for the  produce of that land to keep us in food thereby enriching nations that may some day become our formidable enemies
Wu have no desire to cause annoyance or injury to our landed proprietors but simply to impress on them the impolitic courses pursued on their estates during the greatest part of this century  we do not wish to see their nice home farms divided into crofts or the amenity of their mansions with their beautiful avenues and ancient oaks interfered with
We are as proud of these symbols of life wealth and civilisation as any of them can be and we would wish to see them spend more of then time in these charming residences for it is admitted on all sides that nonresident landlords as well as nonresident farmers are not real contributors to the general wealth of the country
Our association comprise men of different religions and political creeds and although now engaged in different trades or professions almost all of us like most of town populations have been born and brought up in the country which enabled us to have seen and now see the baneful effect of the system of adding farm to farm and clearing out whole communities for the purpose of forming large sheep runs and deer forests
The latest case I refer to is in Glen Banchor which took place over two or three years ago
I did not ask exactly the date of it but it can easily be ascertained from the valuation roll
Mr Macpherson of Belville
It is an old property
It was bought by Mr Macpherson the translator of Ossians poems
It will be about one hundred years in the possession of the family
Seven as far as I am aware
I think they were sitting at will
From the valuation roll of that period I cannot find that they had leases while the present single tenant has a lease of nineteen years
There were two townships at least they were under the name of two townshipsEasterton and Westerton
Yes they had pasture along with it
Yes
No I dont
I dont know whether there was
No I dont  but it was generally said at the time that they were purely and simply turned out
I do a modern eviction
Yes
No I dont
No
No I did not
Yes
About  I think
No I dont
He resides on another farm on a different estate
He is on Sir George Macpherson Grants estate
Yes
Yes that is what the valuation roll gives
I cannot say
I believe myself it has but I would not like to say
It has a tendency to go on to the present time
I cannot exactly say at the expense of the small tenants because they were generally converted into sheep farms first and latterly converted into deer forests
Deer for sheep  but if we go to the root it is deer for people
Yes
Yes the majority of us do
Yes my own opinion is decidedly so from taking observations of my friends and acquaintances who had gone there and some of whom came back
I dont deny that
I quite admit that but I maintain also that while they do emigrate and become large communities in other places they impoverish our own country because they leave our places empty and consequently we want both their produce and their consumption
That is decidedly my opinion
My experience for the last forty yearsand I have been taking particular notice of it for I had a very great mind to emigrate myselfis that they are not such great consumers as the public at home are  and I think we have examples of that in a great many of those who come back from the colonies and who have been fortunate they are more careful and dont consume so much as people who have been brought up at home
Yes
Well it is not for me to make any suggestions because I expect when it comes to that that wiser heads than mine will be engaged in making arrangements for that but I dont see any difficulty in its being done
The people had been doing it formerly without having any encouragement or reward for so doing and I dont see how some encouragement could not be given to a greater extent now
Yes
It could be advantageously regulated and would be a very great benefit to the country and to the nation at large if those parties the tillers of the land who improve the land had longer tenure of their land and did not run the risk of its being put up periodically until they are actually squeezed out of the land even without being evicted in the actual sense of the word we have instances of that in this neighbourhood
That fine place over on Leachkin on the north side of the canal was sixty years ago just waste land
That was given in small lots to tenants and they got on very well
I lived in the neighbourhood for years and a more industrious set of people you could not see and with one exception they were all comfortable
They got on very well and were all comfortable but within the last ten years about that time back a new factor came on the estate and he went over the ground and considered they had it too cheap and it was put up about  per cent upon the rent they were paying before
It is about sixty years since the place was originally cultivated
They would be in occupancy from forty to fifty years
Their lots are from  to  acres and they paid originally from s to s for the lot and they now pay an average of  and  for the quantity of ground
Our association would like that these things would be put on such a footing that the people who actually improved the land would not be liable to be moved about at the mercy of any new incomers by rackrenting
No
The place was advertised before they got even a chance of it at a high rent
It was advertised to be let in one holding and that was the first intimation they got of it  and they went in a body to the proprietor and said they were ready to give the rent that was asked for it and they got a twelve years lease at the advanced rent
That lease was out last year and I believe there are new leases now written out though not handed out to them upon the new system that is upon the estatethree years lease and two years notice
I dont know what the new lease is but I dont think it could be advanced because it was as far advanced as any one could put it twelve years ago
I have
I was born and brought up amongst some of these myself
I was for six or seven years as a boy living in Stratherrick and I scarcely knew any poor man in that district
I believe there are old men in the hall here who had some of these holdings and I know that when they were turned out of their holdings they had a considerable sum of money even in those small places and I also knew of even cottars upon these holdings who had a little money lent to the large farmers
They were from  to  acres with a good outrun of pasture that kept about  sheep or so
The farm of Bunchrubin was occupied by four tenants
They were turned out in  they had about  acres of arable land and  sheep between the four tenants
They paid  of rent
It now pays  and I believe the late Sheriff Tytler improved about  acres and that is the excuse he made to the four tenants for removing them
I think one of the tenants is here who was turned out
Yes
I dont know if they would give the rise but it was against their will that they left the place
I believe they did not get a chance
I believe one of the men is in this hall and if I remember he told me they did not get the offer of it
Quite so
I dont know
I believe there would not be much difference on the rents but the proprietor improved about  acres of land after they left and that was the only excuse that was given to them for being removed
No I cannot
Yes the great reason was the craze for large holdings
There might be as a general rule because we are well aware that rents were increasing all over during that period
I dont believe it
I think a farm of from twenty to thirty acres of land with ordinary pasture to keep from  to
Yes and that is the class of farm that was in Stratherrick at that time
Yes this Bunchrubin was occupied by towns and each holding was named by a name
Each had from six to seven cows nice stackyards  I have seen some of them myself and from fifty to one hundred sheep and each of them was in comparative comfort
I may be allowed to state in regard to the farm of Bunchrubin I dont know how the man who succeeded the four tenants prospered to the end of his lease but I know the farmer before the present one went out of it penniless and the four tenants who went out of it or who were turned out were each of them able to take other farms
One of them took a farm down about Culloden
The others took the farm of Lyne which was a larger holding
I cannot give you the information because I did not go into the inquiry when they were consolidated but I spent four days there in connection with valuations going along these places and I assure you it was a sad sight to see them
It was not even crofters or small farmers but what were termed in my younger days gentleman farmers who occupied some of these houses they were excellent housesslated houses
I could not say exactly as to the extent of the different holdings of arable land but they were I would say farms that would be paying from  to  of rent each
No but from the appearance of the homesteads there must been a good many cottars who generally followed these farms at that time and lived in great comfort
It is now Sir John Ramsdens but then it was Ballybristles and I may be permitted to refer to that as a very great example of the evil of nonresident landlords
Ballybristle lived in England
His principal man of business was in England and there was just a local manager upon the estate
They would not be   over all but I would say from  to  There were Strathmashie Dalchully Shirrabeg Shirramore Garuamore and Garnabog with the finest pasture
Mixed farms but principally sheep farms
That is a class of farms that always paid in the Highlands and that is the class of farms we would like to see still
No it is a sheep farm
Yes the people were removed first for sheep and then deer in a great many instances followed the sheep
No
Certainly it would to a certain extent because of curtailing the land from the few remnants of people remaining
Certainly
It would be the most accurate way certainly
I believe it is in a fair way of being stopped to a certain extent and I believe the reason for that is very much owing to public opinion and also that they find that consolidation does not pay even so well as the ordinary sized farms
I believe a great many of them would be very glad to do so
I am aware of that
Yes I have no doubt if they continued very much longer they would be punished much more for the simple reason that I am quite certain that a very few years will bring landlords to be far more anxious to get their men back than they are just now
Of that I am quite convinced from experience
As a tradesman taking contracts from Badenoch to Loch Inver right along the whole country I have had an opportunity of seeing the great evil that has been caused to the country from an economic point of view
I think there should be no difficulty in that
I know there is more difficulty in it than if the people had been retained on the land for a great many of the people that would take moderatesized farms have either died out or left the country
We had examples not very long ago of some large farms being advertised for small holdings and I believe they got no offers but the reason for that is quite clear
People who could stock a farm of twentyfive or thirty acres of land are not in the neighbourhood now and the larger farmers would not be inclined to go and take them unless they got them altogether and in order to bring about the occupancy of moderatesized holdings there would require to be some help given to them by the advance of money by Government or in some other way and I dont think there is any difficulty in that any more than there is in advancing money for large properties for improvements
For instance on the farm of Lyne that was added to Gorthlick they got some money and improved some land and paid the last penny of it all during a nineteen years lease and at the end of the lease they were turned out for no cause whatever and their farm was added to a large one
It does
I may state that it is my own composition but I submitted it to the executive committee and to a general meeting of our society and they all approved of it
Yes
Why do our statesmen object to the Channel tunnel
They are chary of giving the power to any nation to take advantage of us in case of a difference
Yes we want to have friendly and free intercourse with all nations but we dont want to give them undue advantages for when we send our people or means across there we weaken our own
If we keep our own and allow natural emigration we have no objection to that
There has been an instance to the contrary in the Canadian dominions
I remember they got up in arms against the power of this country and if I am not mistaken one of the chief leaders was a Highlander a Mackenzie
Yes pretty large
Yes
I would say that the rent the people were paying at the time I refer toforty years agowould be a fair rent that is taking all the circumstances into consideration they would pay the rents they were paying then
Taking those instances I brought forwardsuch as  their land was from  to  acres arable and that is  acres divided among four and they paid at that time  between them which made it about  to  a year each
Now considering the increase in the  price of farm produce I would say that at the rents they were paying at that time they shoidd live very comfortably to day but there has been an increase between that period and now
Yes
I would not
I would certainly say so provided it were put upon a system that it would not be at the mercy of every new comer
There is now a tendency for property to change hands and what existed then is not very safe now
According to my own idea I would be in favour of long teuure
Long tenure so as to encourage the people to improve and give them an opportunity to benefit by their occupation
Not so much now of course there are a number for instance the Coigach district is a very nice type
That is a district where the land is limited
I have been there for some time
I have been there as a tradesman and have tried to make myself as well acquainted as possible with it and I would say that where land is limited to that extent the holding would be a very nice one but in that case they only pay from   to   of rent
They have a considerable extent of pasture and in that case they were threatened with some of the ground being turned into deer forest not many years ago which was not as Lochiel put it following the sheep
No I can scarcely do so because in most cases they have been curtailed of the pasture which made them far more comfortable
Small farms are not so comfortable now
They were generally curtailed and I can scarcely point to any place today that is so comfortable as they were at the time I refer to in Stratherrick
Yes I know they would be sufficiently comfortable but they would be far more so by giving them more pasture
I refer to the estate of Glen Urquhart which is almost all small holdings  and I might refer to another in Rossshire where I know some of them are very comfortable
Yes I hold that is the class of people who benefit the country
Not moderately large farms but we have some that are not profitable to the people themselves
It would depend a good deal upon the subject they would get
I would certainly say that about the time they had it would be a fair time to recoup them if they had security that the rent would not be increased unreasonably after that  that it would be revalued by neutral parties and that they would not be turned out of it
Increased too much  and in some cases some of the land taken away altogether and added to a large farm and that was still worse than the increasing
I think a court of inquiry such as we have appointed for other thingsby Government would be the best means of doing itthe most just way of doing it for all parties both proprietor and tenant
I would allow them to take it into consideration that the people reclaimed it
I would
Yes distinctly
Entirely in most cases
I am glad to see we have some proprietors who give effect to that
Quite so
I do
Dores and the parish of Boleskine
It must have decreased
I am not actually aware of it but I am aware by hearsay incidentally
I consider the cause is the way the people were turned out of their holdings
That is the cause of it in Dores and it is partially the cause of it also in Inverness by people coming in from that district
I may mention there is one who was turned out of one of these places who is now a pauper in Inverness
Very much
Not quite
Yes
Yes it quite escaped my mind
I did not wish to avoid the question but it quite escaped my mind
Yes
Yes it was the case and very nice holdings
Old holdings
Yes and there have been a number of larger holdings cleared for them too and smaller ones that were not actually sheep farms
Eighty years ago it was a mixed farm held by some five or six farmers arable and pasture
It was taken from them and added to a farm at Fort Augustus for a sheep farm and it is now a deer forest
Yes I know that from history
No
A very great many
I am not aware of any
Yes
I remember them being commented upon
I dont remember how the particulars were quite given
Yes
Yes
I forget
I may have seen it
I am not aware of that but I would imagine from the man that he would see the injustice of removing the people and would be inclined to withdraw
Not up through it
I have been up part of it
I have been doing some work in that neighbourhood and I just went out to take a look at the country not with any special object
No not to go into details
No I am not aware of that only I am aware that two of them were widows
Yes I was so impressed with it at the time that I could never get rid of itabout how our country was destroyed by that system destroyed in every way because I considered it was destroyed actually for those who were able to take comparatively large holdings it was destroyed as a means of employment and it was destroyed as a means of produce
I am very much under the impression that I was told there by some of the parties about the place that there had been some officers either born or residing there belonging to that neighbourhood natives of Badenochthat they had either been born in these houses and joined the army out of these houses or had come back to reside there
I was informed of that upon the ground
That is what I would certainly call it
They were just made a handle of to increase the value of the place and enrich one individual
I am told but I have no evidence of it that when they commenced there first they were to get  an acre for every acre they reclaimed and a few of them who commenced there first got it for a few acres but none of them got the full amount for the whole they brought in
I know as a fact that some of them who had reclaimed some of it during the last thirty years did not get one penny and after being raised from s to  s for their lot they were latterly deprived of it and it was added to the large farms for no reason whatever
It is one of the finest places I like to look at
Not according to my view
Yes
By a meeting of the crofters
Yes it was about one hundred crofters
No but from the surrounding district
YesCulloden Allangrange and Highfield
 I Donald Bain fiftyseven crofter on the estate of Conon paying   of rent besides poor rates and other taxes along with six days free labour as estate work
My croft consists of about fifteen acres according to survey onethird of which is unfit for improving  it is more suitable for a game preserve for wild fowl being in winter covered with one sheet of water
The other third part could be improved with great expense and labour the which I am not able to manage
However I tried and improved it but it turned to no benefit but loss owing to the situation of the place being so boggy and wet
The other third part is the only part that I can depend on for crop a place thus situated on the outskirts of the property on the heights of the Mulbuie exposed to the elements
I think it unfair that the acreage of it should be compared in value to the acres of that of the lowlying districts  but such is the case and not only but more so for I am paying at the rate of s the acre with the exception of the pasture
I do not impute this grievance to my present proprietor for it is a longestablished grievance I may say hereditary
My father and grandfather had to contend with it  I had it down from them
I am ready to give credit to my proprietor the credit of being under the impression that we are not thus oppressed as it is not his doings but that of employersfactors and valuators
I have now the experience of upwards of forty years of being a rackrented crofter and I assure you gentlemen it is a mode of life not to be coveted
The first nineteen years of that period I was tenant at will threatened to be removed every year
That was during the present proprietors minority when he eutered his majority he granted leases and appointed a factor who acted as valuator
When he came round to value my lot he told me that I was paying such and such of rentI admit too much
I  thought I should get it reduced but instead he made an advance of  per cent on the former rent to force me to make improvement
Had that the desired effect on me
As I had to work before at days wages to make up the old rent I had now to work more to make up this addition of rent
However during the lease I improved between four or five acres but instead of being to me a benefit it turned out to be my loss owing to the water destroying all the produce of it  I had to allow to lie waste under pasture
The landlord had of his goodness granted a new lease and appointed valuatorsneighbouring farmers themselves
When they came to value my lot they found that I was paying enough already
They said they could not reduce it on any account but made no advance so they thought that I may rest satisfied under this grievance so that my prospect for the future is not one of the brightest from my age and infirmity ready to be cast as a burden on my fellowsufferers for that is the fate of us crofters under the present land system
Although thus burdened I have yet one consolation left me to be under the proprietorship of one of a race who proved themselves worthy of being remembered for good  for their names were never connected with anything despicable or mean such as wholesale evictions on the lotsand I am proud to acknowledge that our present proprietor and his excellent partner in life are both noble examples in the north for whatever is good ready to relieve the sick and the dying so that Conon House is always open for relief to the poor and the needy so that the reputation of the worthy baronet did not yet fall to the ground but is kept up more than ever
I have also a paper here from another of the tenants
 My father before me had my croft and paid a rent of   till the time of his death
I then got a nineteen years lease of the croft about ten acres nominally arable and about twenty on very rough pasture at a rent of  and six days free labour
During the currency of the lease I spent over   in improvements to houses and land the proprietor giving me sawn homegrown timber for the houses
I then got a new lease when my rent was raised to   and the usual free labour though it is fair to add that the proprietor restricts it to   during my lifetime
I was then seventyfour years of age
My land is much spoiled with water and I have not got over two returns of corn on the average out of the land that I improved although I did it all manner of justice in draining and manuring
Taking the rest of the land at the old rent the part improved was valued at s per acre
Of course incompetent  valuators were to blame for this and no complaint was lodged because it was currently reported at the time that Sir Kenneth gave the land cheaper than the valuation
Conon estate
The estates all round
No there were delegates appointed from them too
Just rackrented
Too much rent
About fifteen
Six
Just pasture and four or five of them quite useless for pasture
Never
Yes I ploughed four or five acres of that
I had to give it up
 without taxes
A cow and a horse
I can hardly keep that same
If I keep an extra beast it must be at an extra expense
Just by labouring wherever I can get labour at days wages
I am not sure  it is about the half of that
We are the old established tenants on old land
The newly incoming tenants have a better chance than we have and we are left under the old footing
About s or s I think I am sure it is not much more
Nothing of the kind
I believe there was
They were granted  an acre
They all got the compensation
Just for the improvement of the ground
It was considered a proper amount at the time
 dont know of any as far as I know at present
Sir Francis the present proprietors father because he had a large lot of the ground under plantation and it was cut down and he had to get a lot of new tenants to reclaim the ground and that was granted as a remuneration for reclaiming it
Just one township
No the rest are welltodo and well off but this is separate from them
Yes
Well there are not manysix or seven I think in the township I represent
There are forty whatever
Yes
No
That is just what we want to be on the same footing with them
Yes
Yes and we want to be compared with the rest of it
Well I am paying s an acre for the arable and I think the rest of the estate is not paying above s whatever as far as I know
Just about double what the rest are paying
In the same position
In the same position most of them but I daresay they are not altogether so badly off
No
It was of very long standing and it could not be so easily got altered
Some other parties did it but got no encouragement
I did not do it personally myself
At the very top on the heights of the Mulbuie
Yes
Well I dont know that
I know he is a lenient landlord but in the case of reducing rents I cannot say much
He grants us every allowance for building houses and gives us encouragement in every other respect
Well I dont know
I would like to have them reasonable
I would like fair play
No
There was a factor during his minority
It is all the doing of his factor that we are here now
We should go to him as a body but not individually
No except a lease for the first twentytwo years
Yes and I asked for it myself
No he had one of us but we had not one of him
He wrote it on stamped paper
Highfield
Mr Gillanders
Yes so that I would have the house and everything in proper repair and the land in good order and to go out at any time without a summons
I had to leave it with him so he had a hold on me but I had not a hold on him
I would not get it
Not under the present laird
Yes
It would be of no use
It was too high and I would be quite careless whether I would get it at the rent whatever
No
Just about the half
Just about half
Not my neighbours on the same estate but Sir Kenneths and Allangranges
Just about s or s an acre
Some of them have eighteen acres upon Sir Kenneths estate for  Upon Allangrange they have thirtysix acres for  and there is nothing but the road between them and me
One cow
No
No
Well sometimes
Sometimes I have to buy them
Yes
It will not last me long because I had a very poor crop this yearabout four months or five
Yes
Yes
Yes
Certainly if I would get a short lease
Yes
I was always paying it and had to put it out
I dont know
Yes
Yes I have to pay s for each
Yes
Yes
Yes the same amount
Yes
Yes
No
There is no large tenant at all on that part of the property
Yes
No
No
Yes  I am told Sir Kenneth was giving them  per acre
Yes
I dont know
No because we have more work to do in some places than in others
Yes
It would be better than paying for it instead of getting it
It would not tempt any other to go into heather and stone  but now since we have improved it it would be different for another tenant to come in because there was a house built on the land and he had nothing to do but come into the house and sit in it
Yes
Yes
I would have encouragement to make improvements
I have an acre of pasture out yet and I would do my best to take it in but now I am quite careless whether I get it at any rent
Perhaps if I got it in he would put another   or  upon it
Yes I built the second
On the same place
Yes
I harled it on the outside with lime
No except the couples  I had to get the rest of the wood
Yes
No
I had to pay for the sawing and carting them out of the wood to the sawmill
I do
I desire to make a few general statements with reference to the crofter holdings in the Strathpeffer district and afterwards to refer briefly to the leading points in the evidence given by the delegates from that quarterOn the Strathpeffer property of the Duchess of Sutherland and Countess of Cromartie there are eightythree crofters paying rents ranging from  to  Of these there are fiftyseven on the heights or southern slopes of the valley nine in the township of Park and seventeen in Gower or Knockfarell
Fortynine tenants pay rents under  twentysix pay   and up to  and six pay  and up to  There are six holdings ranging from  to  six from  to  three from  to  and only one above  total rental from crofts  It will I think be admitted that this regular gradation of holdings gives all classes a chance and especially the industrious crofter
I believe I am correct in saying that the crofters on the Strathpeffer property hold now every inch of arable ground that they ever possessed
I may here mention that the only improvable ground of any extent was reclaimed by the proprietor between the years  and  viz what are commonly known as the Knockfarell or Gower allotments extending to close upon  acres which were reclaimed at an expense to the proprietor of  or as nearly as possible  an acre
The intention I believe was to provide suitable crofts for some cottars in the village of Achterneed but it happened that a colony of crofters who were removed from another estate to the number of eighteen families applied for this new land and the Duchess of Sutherland then Marchioness of Stafford yielded to their importunities and gave them possession granting them leases and materials with which to build houses
It is due to these people to say that with scarcely an exception they have proved to be excellent tenants in every respect
They are industrious and farm systematically and well and of this we have the best evidence in the fact that they pay their rents regularly and that within the last few years most of them have substantially improved their houses four of which have lately been slated
I have looked up the old records and find that some fifty years ago and prior to that the grazing of the southern division of Wyvis were held by the tenants on the Heights of Strathpeffer
I have been unable to trace exactly what the arrangement was but I believe the tenure was a yearly one a few of the principal lotters being responsible for the rent which I find in  was only  a year
At that time the rent was returned in the name of Kenneth Maclennan who I find gave up the holding in  leaving the rent in arrear
It has been stated that these people were deprived of this grazing but my information is that the tenants could not agree among themselves about its management
It is wellknown that in these days they were unable to stock all this grazing and that they were in the habit of taking in horses and cattle from the Black Isle and other places and summering them on this pasture in order to enable them to pay even the small rent then exacted
This grazing was subsequently let in conjunction with Glenskaich proper to a Mr James Scott who held it until his death in  when it fell into the hands of the proprietrix
The farm was so held until  when it was left to Messrs Arras Fodderty at a rent of  Seeing that this grazing was in the proprietrixs own hands for a period of ten years it does seem strange that no proposal was made by these tenants for reacquiring it
If they are in earnest now in their wish to have it again it seems to me that they ought in common fairness and courtesy to have made their wishes known in the usual way instead of bringing it forward here as a grievance
In  seven years before I had anything to do with the management nineteen years leases were granted to almost all the tenants in the Heights of Strathpeffer
These leases expired in  It was a stipulation of the lease that the tenant should give six days labour by himself or substitute or three days labour with a horse and cart each year for making or repairing roads or other useful works
It was however found somewhat difficult at times to put this stipulation into practice
It was therefore deemed advisable on the expiry of the lease to enter into a different arrangementthe intention being to let the repair of the roads to a contractor and to add a small sum to the rents in lieu of the stipulated labour
The yearly value of the labour was s but when revising the rents this sum was only imposed in the case of a few of the largest and best lots while in the case of some twenty tenants there was no rise of any kind asked while in some instances there was a reduction made
The revised rents however have not as yet been levied whether they will be or not I am unable to say
These rents average under   per acre which considering the situation the quality of much of the land proximity to a railway station and to good markets cannot be regarded as other than reasonable
I may add that at Strathpeffer now so largely frequented during the Spa season there is almost an unlimited demand for dairy produce poultry and eggs and while there are some who do take advantage of this ready market there are many who do not
While there are some industrious good tenants we have I am sorry to say some quite the reverse
There is the case of Alexander Gray mason and crofter
I mention this case in connection with the position this man took up as chairman of a meeting of a few of the tenants and some outsiders called to discuss the tenants socalled grievances
Alexander Gray became tenant at Martinmas  He came from another estate when his offer of   for a ten acre croft was accepted
He paid the first half years rent but not another penny until  when he paid other  leaving five years rent  s in arrears
Upon representing this matter to the Duchess of Sutherland and her advisers I was instructed to write off this sum of  upon giving an assurance that he would pay up afterwards
How he has kept that promise may best be judged from the fact that at this moment he owes over three years rent
He is a mason to trade and has a fair croft of ten acres arable and slated house for   a year
I ask is there another proprietor in Scotland who would have shown the same indulgence
Some reference has been made to myself personally in the course of statements made by the delegates
In the first instance I would refer to the statements of Donald Macdonald
He occupies a croft containing  acres  roods  poles of old arable at a rent of  s d
There was an increase of something more than a pound proposed to be put on
It is very fair land with a southern exposure accessible to good roads and within a few hundred yards of a railway station
This delegate admitted that sixty years ago this land was worth s per acre
I submit that a rise of s per acre in sixty years is not unreasonable in the circumstances
This and the other delegate John Rose in the statements they have made have principally dwelt upon things which they say happened eighty years ago
These statements which they have now brought forward as grievances I have heard today for the first time and I do think it would only have been fair and reasonable that if they really felt aggrieved they should in common fairness have acquainted us of this and asked for redress
They did nothing of the kind
They said a great deal in disparagement of the late factor Mr Scott
I venture to say that Mr Scott was a just and honourable man who held his responsible position for a period of very near half a century with the entire confidence of his constituents the late Cromartie and his daughter the present Duchess of Sutherlandand I venture to say that neither Cromartie nor the Duchess of Sutherland would keep in their service any factor who would do an unjust or unkind thing to any of their tenants
Slight reference has been made to myself in this matter which induces me to ask you to allow me to read a short petition signed by these people in 
Some of the statements made by the delegate Rose certainly implied that
I am very glad to hear that your Lordship thinks otherwise because that was my impression
It would seem to me that their statements have gone back for a period of eighty years
My connection with this property has only extended over fifteen or sixteen years
It is impossible for me to say what might have occurred sixty or eighty years ago
I believe that the statements made by them are open to question but I am not prepared at this moment to state distinctly to what extent that is so
I believe that the then proprietor of the Cromartie estate Mr John Hay Mackenzie was not the man to have disturbed tenants and removed them on to a barren moor without taking the matter into consideration and dealing kindly by them
I am quite prepared to admit that it is extremely likely that these crofts have at some remote period been improved by the ancestors of the present tenantry
I am not aware that anything but the course usual in such circumstances was adopted and that was to charge a nominal rent giving the improver time and assisting him by giving him materials for his buildings
Of recent years assistance has been given in the shape of timber and slate the slate to be repaid at interest  per cent being charged for the use of it
Yes
I am unable to answer exactly what the arrangement was when the leases to which I refer in my statement were entered into whether there was a regular valuation by an experienced valuator or notbut I was not aware there was any grievance felt as to the amount charged on that occasion till I heard it here today
Yes but with the concurrence of the tenants
Quite so  but as a matter of fact they never had occasion to leave
Most decidedly
I think that is only fair and right with respect to any improvements made by the tenant if he can show he has not derived the full value of them but if he has during a long period of years held the land at a low or comparatively nominal rent I hold that during that period he has been recouped for his outlays and really there must be a limit to the period of time when a tenant can claim meliorations for his improvements
I am not aware of any such
I think it is only quite proper if a tenant can show on entering on a lease or when he is leaving that he has really left any value anything that has enhanced the value of the subjectand that he has not derived the full advantage of his improvements he ought to get the benefit in some shape or form
Quite so
That is quite the best view to take of it and we have never had any difficulty hitherto that I have heard of till today
No we have hardly ever had a change
Reference was made to one instance in which there was a change and that is the case of a man named Sutherland
This man I believe I am correct in saying was grieve on one of the best holdings in the neighbourhood lie ought to be a competent judge of the subject
He saw it
He could judge for himself
He made an offer for it which was accepted
That offer was   or  above the rent paid by the outgoing tenant
We had only one offer
I believe it was not advertised
Indeed I dont recollect of any instance in which we advertised crofter holdings
We rarely have a change
I cannot recollect any case where such a thing was called for
Very few changes
The rent is exacted for the land not for the buildings but I certainly say that if any application was made by a tenant who could show that he had really of recent years improved his buildings and left anything material in their value that would be considered
It was simply this
As you are aware these holdings were held under lease and at the expiry of the lease it is usual to have a rearrangement
In this case it was one of the stipulations of their lease that the people were to give so many days service for the repairing aud improving of a road which was made for their own accommodation at the expense of the proprietor
To a very great extent it was
But in answer to the petition which was made and in consideration of the fact that that particular season was a very bad one this small increase on an average not quite s on each holding was remitted
The whole holdings were revised and as I mentioned in some cases there was no increase whatever
In these this labour charge was remitted entirely and in other cases there may have been a slight increase but more to equalise rents
In some instances there was a reduction from the original rent under the lease
I dont consider there was
In the immediate neighbourhood separated from the holding of one of the delegates who appeared here today there is the farm of Keppoch
That was let at a considerable increase of rent in fact the rent is very nearly   per acre for land just simply separated by a hedge from land held by tenants at s or s or less
Yes  and it is right it should be higher
It has many circumstances in its favour
It is lower it is richer soil  and during a long series of years it has been better farmed and manured
And then there is another consideration that on the farm there are extensive buildings and I am quite free to admit that the crofter who pays   or    Is per acre really puts as much into the proprietors pocket as the larger tenant who pays the larger rent
Not at this moment but I may mention that there are pitches of waste land attached to most of those crofts on the slopes of the Strath extending in all to about one hundred and fifty acres
There has been no let or hindrance to these people
They could have reclaimed that land but I believe they find it very useful as pasture outrun
That goes in with the arable area
Clearly  I think that is quite a feasible and good arrangement
Yes
I have an explanation to give with regard to the leases which I omitted before
A statement was made that certain of the tenants paid s for a lease which they never obtained
Now Mr Fraser Mackintosh hit upon the explanation
Those leases had to be signed before notaries and the charge was made by those two notaries with whom the estate had nothing whatever to do
I believe the originals of all these leases are in the estate office
What has become of the duplicates I am unable to say
I will say however for Mr Andrew Smith the Dukes agent that I feel sure he is not the man to take any mans money without giving him value for it and I feel surprised that the s should have been paid by those people without getting their leases
Why they have not got them I am unable to say
Quite so
Yes and I may remark that I think the statement was made by the delegates that they had asked renewals of their leases and had been refused
I am here to say that that is not the case
One of these delegates
Rose did ask for a lease
He afterwards came and said he had a difficulty with his partner who was an old man in coming to an arrangement and that for the present he would like the matter deferred
I have repeatedly told those tenants who had a great deal of land to reclaim that we were willing to enter into a new lease with them and give them as long a lease as was desired provided that this land would be reclaimed
I may say I am pretty well acquainted with the neighbouring estates and I am bound to say I have heard it repeatedly said by managers who have come here that they do not know any class of tenantry anywhere who have such an appearance of comfort as they have
Upon the whole we have very little difficulty
There is considerable arrear just now because we have no desire to be harsh in times which have lately been not good  but as a rule these arrears are standing in the names of some of the tenants who as I said are not so industrious as they might be
I cannot recollect any case in which any such reason has been given
I am very glad you have asked that question
Ever since I have had to do with the property a very large sum has been expended upon estate improvements and as a rule the people living on the  property always have the first chance of that labour when they are disposed to do it
So that for the last dozen years very large sums have been expended and a great deal of that money has gone into the pockets of the residenters on the property
There is great scarcity of labour  indeed the large farmers complain of the great difficulty they have in getting labour at harvest and other busy times
Yes a very considerable extent of building in Strathpeffer it is a growing place
Most decidedly
I was extremely surprised to hear that statement and I should like to know who the party is
I am pretty well acquainted with every tenant on the property
We had a meeting of the Parochial Board the other day and it seems extraordinary that such a case could occur without my knowledge and it seems still more strange that the man who came to make the statement should not have acquainted me with it
Then it is still more surprising
Well I can only say I am very much inclined to disbelieve the statement
Quite so
I shall make inquiries
I think on further inquiry by the Chairman he elicited the information that no one was harshly dealt with in connection with the game and I am prepared to confirm the statement that in no case within my knowledge has any tenant been visited in any unkindly way in connection with game
Certainly they are quite at liberty to exercise any powers they have under the Act of Parliament without prejudice
I am not aware of any
I have no recollection of the circumstance
I have no recollection of the circumstance
It might have been
If the man was guilty of poaching it is very likely his case may have been taken up
I have no recollection of the circumstance you have referred to
It might have been done by the lessee of the shootings but I have no recollection of doing it by authority of the proprietrix
Yes I believe they did
I would rather not mention names
It is a matter that is well known
Yes as to what was said by one of the Bonar delegates
I do not know that there is great need for my addressing you on this occasion and in doing so I simply desire to make clear to your Lordship and the other Commissioners some things which I do not think the delegate Alexander Campbell made plain to you at Bonar
Alexander Campbell has only been a rentpayer on the Balnagown estate since  see his offer for croft
Previous to this date he was a subtenant to the late Dr Gordon who held the farm of Badvoon and Kincardine and who brought him on to the Balnagown property
I understand about  Dr Gordon had besides Alexander Campbell thirteen subtenants not thirty or forty as stated by him
On the expiry of Dr Gordons lease and at the time these farms were let to Mr Anderson the then subtenants were continued in their holdings at the rent they now pay  s
At the time I had not the smallest difficulty in arranging the rents with them
I had no complaints then of the rents being too high and Alexander Campbells statement to your Lordship and other Commissioners was the first I ever heard with one exception
One tenant complained that his rent was too much this was about six months ago
Neither had I any difficulty at the time in satisfying these tenants that they were better without sheep  they consented to want them without any pressure on my part and I am satisfied after the experience I have had that on that particular ground they are better without them still
If these tenants at any future time are in a position to stock the whole of the hill it might then be a question for reconsideration
If the crofters on the Balnagown property in Kincardine are too high rented I assume the responsibility so far as it can be laid on my shoulders
I blame no one except that the crofters must take their share of it in their not having at the proper time complained of the rents they were asked to pay and willingly agreed to pay
Notwithstanding  the present complaint I have no hesitation in saying that if these holdings were to let now I could not only let them at the present but an increased rent
It would not have paid to put a fence up there and the piece of ground they allude to is not suited for sheep
That was so
I forget whether he paid any increase or not when he took the farms
I cannot answer that question but I rented him at what I thought fair value for the farm and I acted in the same way to the crofters
I think it is likely he would
I think so
No their rents were the same with the exception of a few shillings
I think a few shillings were taken off each of them to the best of my recollection
I think the delegate stated yesterday that his rent was  s and he formerly paid  s
Over two miles
I think it would have cost about Is per yard
A good bit of it would have required to be iron altogether as it was on rocky hill ground
Yes
The rent of the two farms is Badvoon  Kincardine  s d
Yes
I think under the circumstances it was an unnecessary outlay because the ground the crofters had was unsuited for sheep
I had no difficulty in arranging with them not the slightest at the time
I can show you Campbells offer for his place if you wish to see it
I cannot answer that question
Very possibly it was
I could answer that afterwards but I cannot do it now see Appendix A
LXXIII
I dont think I took advantage of either the one or the othereither the tenant or the crofters
I acted between the two as fairly and justly as I could
No
No doubt of it but the ground is not suited for sheep in summer
Sheep would not live on the ground they complain of
Allow me to explain that Dr Gordon held those farms and brought the subtenants on to the ground and in making this arrangement with him I did the whole thing to the best of my ability
Mr Anderson put up a fence to keep them off a particular part of the ground but at his own expense
No these crofters never claimed any right to that bit of ground
I did not hear him and if he said so I am certain it was a mistake
No the crofters were entirely on the Kincardine ground not on the Badvoon ground at all
None whatever
None whatever
There have been one or two cases of crofts being added to one another where a family had died out and there was nobody to succeed in order to make larger ones
In
Yes
None whatever
It was taken from the large sheep farm
No they do not
The deer are very far from them
No
None except from our own shepherds
The sheep farm is in the proprietors hands and one shepherd particularly complains of the deer meddling with his croft
Each case is considered individually by itself
It depends on how long the tenant has been in the place and what he has done for the place
It is not done at any stated period
Each case is considered by itself
From time to time
No I cannot say it has
A little but not much
I cannot say what proportion but not much
Yes it has
None at all
I may mention to give you an idea how we actedand this has reference to Strath Carronthat the acreage of arable land in Strath Carron crofts in  was  acres in    increased  being an increase of fiftyfour acres of arable land by twentynine tenants in fortythree years
The acreage in  was  acres being an increase of nine acres between  and  and a total increase in fiftyfive years by twentynine tenants of sixtythree acres equal to an average of two acres twentyseven poles improved by each of the twentynine tenants in fiftyfive years
Some of them improved more and some of them improved less
I have done it I have relet the whole of the Balnagown property without the slightest trouble and with great pleasure to myself
There have not been half a dozen farms advertised for public competition since the estate came under my management
The average rental of this Strath is about s per acre
Yes since
Yes in this situation
In some situations it would not be worth so much
Sometimes
There is no special rule
It is a matter of arrangement in each case
Sometimes tiles are supplied and sometimes it is done by the tenants paying interest
I dont know what was the system in those old times but I understood that the proprietor gave wood to help to build the houses in those days
Sometimes
Not lime
That was given many years ago and the tenants paid interest
I dont know they repaid the lime but they paid interest and it was added to the rent
But the proprietor does not give wood now except by special arrangement
None
Yes
My experience of that place since  is that they are in a better position without sheep than with them
The delegate Campbells rent is  s
 Mr Anderson gives him  leaving his rent at    s
I do not think they would
I do
Yes
In  The ground was cleared of sheep in  I should say there are two
It is let to two tenants
I think about  acres but that is not all cleared of sheep
There are sheep upon a portion of both places
I dont think so because that ground before a sheep was put on to it was under deer and in going over it I can see few or no traces of where crofters had been
Some  or  acres roughly
Yes I have
They never had it
No they never possessed it
They wandered over the whole place without any authority on the part of the tenant to keep them
No they are not deprived of the acreage of the hill for pasture on the hill
They never had any right to it
I had not the opportunity
They never had
They never paid any rent for it
Yes but only on a portion of it
These crofters have each his own house and his own bit of arable ground and a piece of pasture ground in connection with it
That is their whole holding
Yes the other was merely a tolerance
Because they did not ask to retain it
They departed from it without any trouble
Besides I did not think they had capital to carry on these farms
They never said they had stock to carry on these farms
If they had said so the matter would have been considered
I have said so in my statement
If these tenants at any future time are in a position to stock the whole of the bill it must then be a question for reconsideration
I thought I was asked to explain about it
I understood some of the Strath Carron tenants were to be examined about it yesterday and I wanted to show how the increase was made
I dont think it is out of the way
No I did not make it with that intention at all
Because the ground near to their own ground is unsuited for sheep
Sheep would not thrive on it in summer
Well it is matter of opinion
I manage a sheep farm
It has been more profitable than it has been these last few years
Entirely so
No by no means it was entirely with reference to this particular piece of ground
None whatever
I never had a complaint from one of them on the subject except one tenant who complained about six months ago that his rent was too dear
His rent was  s for a house and two acres of ground
I see them every year
I have been in every house on the property and am personally acquainted with every tenant on the estate
Quite accessible
They can come to me at any time and are quite aware of that
It is not only my own wish but it was my instruction from the late Sir Charles Ross to take care of the small tenants and not to press them or overrent them
They are not well off
Yes
I have never done anything in the county but at this time I am preparing to make a mile of road in the parish at the proprietors expense and I had a road from the public road to the station put in order and down to the shore at the proprietors expense
Yes but they are scarce and not plenty
Yes
He was to get three acres and the grazing of a cow and timber to put his house in tenantable repair and to be paid  per acre for everything he improved and all that to be free of interest during his lifetime
I cannot say
He was informed by both the proprietor and myself
No
Not that I am aware of
We were very anxious to keep him on but we could not arrange with him
I am not authorised at present to say
Yes
No
Yes
 My father took a croft of three or four acres of arable land at Slestary in  with hill pasture attached at a rent of  He built a new house and farm steading on it
In  the best part of the hill ground was taken off and put to the factors sheep farm and the rent reduced to  After the marches were thus altered it was allowed to be the dearest croft on Skibo estate
My father was yearly adding a little to the croft and paying his rent up to the time of his death in My mother  and children after him continued to do the same until she died in  Then my brother and my sister along with me continued reclaiming land as we were able and in  the croft contained twelve acres arable well limed and in regular rotation
The valuator that valued the estate for Mr Sutherland Walker said it was the best cultivated croft in the district
In  Mr Sutherland Walker by his new marches reduced the croft to seven acres and cut off all the outlying pasture
For the croft as now reduced he wanted  s binding me at the same time to improve five acres on a ten years lease
I could not agree to this and was obliged to give up the place without compensation for buildings or land improvement
He has not settled with me for the valuation of manure fallow land and damaged crops
Having disagreed about Slestaryhe pressed me several times to take Breackwell to which I had the same objections and could never agree to take it on his conditions
But my brother Robert in his anxiety to see his brother and his sister and myself in a home agreed to take the place on the proprietors representation of it and promising to see us comfortable
In  two acres of the turnip crop was destroyed by a burn overflowing its banks on account of the drains he made in the moor above and in  second years grass and other pasture were damaged by another burn overflowing on account of obstructions left in it by parties digging for sand by his authority
On being rendered an account of these damages for payment he repudiated and told me to take legal steps to recover it that the land was his and he could do with it what he pleased
The outgoing tenant of this place carried off the best part of the straw that grew on it and used the best part of the fallow land for potatoes but we at the end of the lease are not allowed to carry away the straw nor plant potatoes and in this way we pay ten rents for nine crops
This was not understood by us when the lease was signed
The tenant of the adjoining croft at Slestary containing about nine acres arable at a rent of  s is bound to improve nine acres and to build a new dwellinghouse and steadings
Yes
To some
There are some who have grievances similar to this
Not quite alike
No it is personal to myself
They complain of high rent and want of compensation for improved lands and dwellings and they want fixity of tenure and not having pasture
Yes
They were deprived of their pasture about thirtyeight years ago
They have no satisfaction for all their labour
There are some crofters who improved their land to such an extent and they are not allowed compensation even on their removal
By cultivating it out of moor or bad ground
This was the system upon the estate that the estate was overrented since this man got it
It was small lots the tenants were taking
They were taking the hill and improving the crofts themselves making a kind of a home first
I cannot say
Before it
Yes several times
Their rents are heavily raised upon their own improvements
Yes some of them left the estate
They did not get any compensation
I cannot say
Most likely they did
No I have not got it but there are some to come forward that can show it
I think James Sutherland
I am paying s d
I improved it where I was before I came to Breackwell
Yes
Yes
There is no outrun except four or five acres and it is charged Is per acre
Yes
Yes but at a great deal of expense
It is given to me under the name of twentythree acres
Four or five
 s
Two cows and two horses I think that would be about the stock of the place
No for at times I may have a little more and at times I may be under it but it is about what the place can keep
Yes
Ye
No there are several years that there will not be a stirk
When a man has two cows perhaps they will go wrong at times
Yes
No
That is my grievance
It was my brother took the lease
The proprietor would not grant it upon that condition
Yes
Yes there is
The whole of it is quite vacant and it might be given to the whole of the tenants
Yes a great advantage
Of course they would
Mr Sutherland Walker
I cannot say about that
No no lease no stock it is under game
Grouse
Without any stock
There are deer in the woods beside it
It is held by the proprietor
About two or three years
It was a sheep farm but it was first occupied by tenants
In the year  it was under tenants and then the factor got it and turned it into a sheep farm
He was turning out the tenants day by day
In bits there is but where it is the fence is put up at the tenants own expense by paying so much yearly
A wire fence where it is
Where I am I will not complain of either one or the other
Yes some of the tenants are complaining of them
Those that are on the hill complain of the grouse but those that are in the downlying district complain most of deer
Not any compensation
It is in the lease that there is to be no compensation for any thing of the sort
Forbes
He is in the grave
In
To Mr Robert Tennant of Leeds
No but Mr George Grant Mackay had Messrs Rule and Stewart as his partners when he bought the estate first and he paid them off and kept the estate for himself
Yes in
Yes
Yes
He has sold Glen Cassley but he sold that before he got Rosehall as his own portion
There are three propertiesGlen Cassley Glen Rossal and Rosehall
They were sold altogether in

Yes
I am not certain of the amount I believe it was close on  but for the whole estate they got 
Yes
Very little
There were temporary roads made and some of the hill pasture that was to be feued was ploughed by oxen so as to encourage feuars to feu the ground
There were a few that were unable to keep their feus and the land fell back into Mr Tennants hands and he gave them leases
First of all after buying the property they sold all the wood that was on the estate
There were four steam sawmills put up to cut down the wood and the whole of the wood on the estate almost was cut down
Then Glen Cassley was sold to Mr Gordon MLeod from Skye and Glen Rossal was sold to Mr Stewart who had been a partner in the purchase of the property and afterwards Mr Mackay became the proprietor of the Rosehall estate
After the whole was feued the hill pasture was taken off the tenants
There were about  acres of hill ground in the hands of the crofters
This  acres was advertised in the papers to be feued and people from a distance that did not know the land came forward and feued the ground at an average of about s an acre
These feuars took possession of the ground and some of them have been making improvements upon it
Some of them have wasted their means upon these grounds and after wasting their own means they applied to loan companies to lend money on the securities of their holdings
There were a few acres of the pasture that was held formerly attached to their arable ground and given out as feus
This pasture they were charged s an acre for and they were charged   an acre for their arable ground
Most of them got the option of taking it themselves first and if they did not take it then it was offered to any man who would take it
Yes the whole of their holdings
At first they all refused but Mr Mackay told them he would carry out his wish and if they did not take it he would give ground and houses to other people
Therefore about ten days before Whitsunday  most of them came to give it a trial
There were about thirty crofters on the township of Altas at the time the estate was sold and of these there were twelve who did not accept of the terms
There were six of these who did not get the chance of taking them
These were women and the old men who could not do any good to the land and these meu did not get the chance of taking it on any terms
They were deprived of the whole of their labour and their dwellinghouses and without a halfpenny of compensation
There were other six also that would not take it and they left without getting any compensation for what they had done
Perpetual
After taking about  acres of hill ground off them and about  or  acres of lowland pasture off them for what was left to them they were charged double what their former rent was with this pasturage
No they paid an annual feuduty
No
Yes
Yes and s for the waste ground which no sheep farmer in the county would think worth d an acre
Some of it was hopeless but there were other parts that would improve and could be made arable with great expense after about  an acre was put out on them
A great deal
Yes by strangers who came to see it but none of those parties who knew the land ever offered for it
Nothe principle is good but it is overdone by the feuduties being in some cases three times what the value of the land is
The double of the feuduty that is a years rent
Some of them were put on the parochial roll and supported by the parish
No
No
Nothing of the kind
Along with the thirty crofters there were  cottars and paupers upon the estate and they were ejected and their holdings were given to others along with the crofters
I stated there were six who did not get an opportunity and six who got the opportunity and did not accept of it
Probably there might be about eight cottars I am not certain of the number
No provision whatever
The parties who feued the ground allowed some of them to remain in their holdings
The condition is this with regard to some of the feuars that when their means were done they applied to loan companies for money to carry on and money has been advanced to them by loan companies upon the faith of their holdings and the result was that they were not able to pay according to the terms of agreement and they were sequestrated and vacancies occurred in Rosehall with liabilities amounting to over  in the last seven years
In some cases the trustees were not able to realise what would make a halfpenny of a dividend after the expenses and preferable claims were paid
In other cases it was only a few pounds so it is not only the feuars who have suffered but a great many of the public as well
Yes even our good Caledonian Bank has lost  or 
I am not very well acquainted with them but they have been complaining
I have lived in Rosehall for the last twentyfour years
I sometimes carry on shoemaking
Yes I know everything about them for the last twentyfour years by what I saw and for more than twenty years before that from old men
I am certain of that
And so we do because our holdings were sold by Sir James to Mr Mackay and the improvements made he says he bought for a sum of money and they were all summonsed at the instance of Sir James
Yes I believe it would
There has been both
Yes and gone past what was ordinarily done
There is one instance I can give of how the feus were overfeued
There is one place of  acres that was feued in  at  Between  and  there were three feuars upon that place in succession one after another
Their loss was about  between them
In  the feu came into the hands of Mr Tennant and after an outlay of  he was not able to let it at anything up till Whitsunday  In  there was a man who took a fifteen years lease of it at an annual rent of 
Yes
Then in the March following he made a moonlight flitting and left Mr Tennant without paying a halfpenny of rent and the place was in Mr Tennants hands up till  In  he let it to another man for  That man kept it till Whitsunday  and left without paying a halfpenny of the  In  a neighbouring crofter gave an offer of  providing there woidd be a certain portion of it fenced which would cost I suppose about  This offer was accepted and there has been  paid for it since Whitsunday  Mr Tennant bought the feus upon twentytwo years purchase so this feu cost him at first  and he has laid out  along with that and all the estate took in from  up till now has been   only they have the shooting
The first man expended somewhere about  and he left it after paying a years feuduty and  putting down a crop without getting anything for it only Mr Mackay gave him a valuation for the crop
Then it was feued to a man from Orkney
He came forward and built houses upon it and a waterpower threshingmill
He got disgusted and the feus were not supposed to be so bad as they were and he tried to get it sold and he got a man from Aberdeen to come forward and give  for it
He was there for about two years and he saw he was  done and tried to sell it
He went to Mr Tennant and told him what he had done and Mr Tennant gave him  for it and he thought he would get it let at a high rent but he never got anything for it till late in  Mr Tennant then laid out about  in improving the houses and doing other improvements
Yes for purchasing the property from Mr Mackay
He gave twentytwo years purchase
About thirtythree
There is one feu that is I suppose over  acres feued by Professor Geddes Aberdeen
About fourteen acres
Yes
Well as to the old crofters who took feus their average will be from twelve to seventeen acres
Yes several cases
They have been tried to be sold but a halfpenny could not be got for them
There was a gentleman from Glasgow who expended  on his feu
He was paying  of feuduty and he expended  and he became bankrupt before he died and the trustees were unable to get a halfpenny for it
Yes they have
No I dont think they were sold for a profit after the outlay
No some of them have been sold
Well they are trying to clear their way pretty well some of them got help from Australia and friends elsewhere
Their average will be about seven
There are some as low as five and six and some as high as nine and ten
No they have not they made more improvements when they were tenants at will than they have done since they became feuars
No there are none here allowed to remain as crofters
They became crofters afterwards by giving up their feus to Mr Tennant but every one who would not be a feuar was turned out
Yes but I understand that he got some more lowlying pasture added to it
Yes but the hill pasture was taken off him
His land was feued by another man he was only the subtenant of this feuar
He lost his holding from Mr Mackay and he was a subtenant
I suppose the first of them came there about
Yes but there is a delegate from Dornoch an old man Sandy Mackintosh who can testify to this and he has seen his fathers and his grandfathers houses on fireHe has a personal grievance of his own
Nominal A nominal rent some of them Is
Then their parents improved the land with the help of the children as they were getting up and when the father died the rent was raised and successively raised in cases of death within a few years after that I will give you an instance of a womanIsabel Mathieson living in the neighbourhood
Her father paid a rent of Is
He improved a few acres of land
He died and the son was entered as tenant
He was rented at 
No I dont and about eight years after the son became tenant he died and this woman was rented at  and a few shillings at seventy years of ageand she cannot keep more than a cow a horse and a stirk
A sister of the man who entered after his father
I think there were six or seven years between the deaths of the father and brother
My mothers croft is supposed to have suffered more through evictions than any other in Sutherland
Mr Mackenzie describes the evictions on page  of his Clearances and last year I suffered fourteen days imprisonment for an expression of dissent against the incoming tenant
My father and I was ten years of age at the time
This was at a later date
My father was not evicted from these lands because these lands were in the parish of Rogart
Yes fortytwo years ago but I dont complain of that
No my father didnt come here
No she is not in the parish of Rogart
No I am merely a delegate
I reside in the place six or seven months in the year
Yes
Whenever a new name enters the rent is raisedsometimes from s to  after all their own and their forefathers labour
On this barren heath there is no pasture of any kind and there is a long bleak ridge with a northern exposure about one mile in length and half a mile in breadth and they have no pasture on it and most of them have to toil cutting whins for their beasts
Yes but that was all taken from them this last spring
The visitors have got it
That is best known to themselves
Perhaps it is for improving the woods but that supply is cut off from them
Yes the pasture lands on the farm of Cambusavie are in the neighbourhood
Mr Urquharts
There are two shepherds and a twohorse arable farm
Yes it is a large sheep farm
No two pair of horses
Skelbo I think keeps five pair of horses
Yes
Yes and the people were driven away to these barren heaths where none but men in despairing circumstances would attempt it
It was an eviction in the parish of Rogart at the instance of the Duke
The keeper was averse to the incoming tenant who was the son of a southern shepherd who took an active part in the burning
His name was Robert Orr and I used the expression that he would never come there I was tried before the sheriff
Yes of course there was a lot of people gathered
No we were convicted of a breach of the peace
I am but what kind of a valuation was it
Yes
To my knowledge they never made any inquiries and they never travelled the ground
I was up at Rogart on my mothers land and I could see they were almost a quarter of a mile away when they took out the rent roll looked at the place and walked away
I got the same version ever since from every other person
They may have travelled the ground in some instances but I never heard of it
None so far as I made inquiries about it and to my own knowledge that is the way they stood looking at my mothers croft
They came on the opposite side not far offabout a quarter of a mileand they took out the rentroll and walked away the ground officers telling them I suppose the croft and the name of the tenant
I believe the Duke never intended that
I believe he meant the valuation to be in a just and fair way and if that had been done very few complaints would have been heard by the Commission
Undoubtedly that they would walk over the ground to see what kind of soil it was and I think they should consult some local expert as to what return the land was giving for the labour bestowed upon it
I would call that a just valuation
Well I dont know but perhaps these men had been instructed to do so
I am of opinion the Duke meant a just valuation and all inquiries to be made about the land
Ten in Balvraid and fourteen in Badinish
Yes
I have been so long among them that they look upon me as one of themselves
Yes
I am not prepared to say the exact time but I think it was about August or maybe sooner or some weeks later
I know it was back or forward about that time
Well I could not say but I would think in my opinion that they were told to make a fair and just valuation
That was my opinion
Neil Leslie married a niece of the former tenant
s
When the tenant diedhis wifes unclehe was rented at  s
He is still in possession
 s
With regard to Isabel Mathieson at first her father paid a nominal rent of Is
When the father died the son was entered as tenant and he was rented at  Then the son died six or seven years after the father and Isabel succeeded
About  s
I cannot say
I cannot say
Eight or nine acres of the sort of soil
None at all and the soil there is not worth even Is d an acre
I asked a man who was a judge of pasture some weeks ago in case the tenants were ejected from their holdings what rent he would give for it for a sheep pasture
He said he would not have it for nothing for in two years it would turn to heather again
No she lives with her sister
She is about seventy years of age
The best way they can I suppose
They get help from the neighbours
They cannot keep it long
It is just a struggle for existence
It belonged to my father
My father was an old soldier
Yes
Previous to the year  Torboll contained only four tenants but on the expulsion of the people from the neighbouring lands to make room for a sheep farm the four lots were subdivided into seven
On a complaint being made to Lady Stafford of the smallness of the crofts she granted them the use of the grass growing on a piece of land reolaimed from the sea called  The Ebb to winter a cow and a horse for each tenant This continued until the year  After they had got the hay seasoned and carried part of it on their backs for half a mile through the wood possession was taken of it by the Dukes forester
On a complaint being made by Sergeant Mackintosh to the factor he promised to lay the matter before the Duke and to let them know his decision in a few days but no word was received until late in October
The day after the Duke left for London the innkeeper at Dornoch to whom the hay was said to be sold by the forester sent carts and took it away
The people then had to sell part of their beasts at a loss having lost the chance of the market owing to its being so late in the season not having received word sooner
We complain of the smallness of our holdings not being large enough to maintain us six months in the year insecurity of tenure no protection against rackrenting and no compensation for improvements in case of removal
No
It is taken away from the tenants and they will not get leave to cut grass
No
No they are not allowed
It is fenced in
It belongs to the Duke and is fenced in but they got liberty for forty or fifty years to take grass to help them
No not for two years back
Yes by the crofters
No they were not warned
Seven
From three to four so far as I understand
Yes there is a good bit of pasture
They keep perhaps two or three cows and I keep one myselfno horse
Yes some of them have horses but they provide for the horses by gathering whins for them and one thing and another
No
No sheep at all
Yes they may have a young beast or the like of that but they cannot keep them long
One year or so
I myself pay  s
No there are some of them who dont pay so much
Yes one or two pay more
The valuation rent was  for each croft I understand
No they dont fish any
There is no work going now
Not that I know of except working about farms and the like of that
The young men do so and some of the young women and they help their parents too
That is the general style they have and if it were not for that I believe we would have the old people all on the poor roll
No I dont know anything about that
Not in my neighbourhood where I reside
There have been none removed out of it within these thirtysix years to my knowledge
Yes
I have improved my own house
It cost me  I got rope and sarking from the Duke to the value of about  but it cost me  to improve it myself and if I left it next day I would not get any value for it
I was born in the parish of Rogart
Yes he had but it was larger
It was subdivided
When I went to the army there were only four tenants
In
I was twentytwo years in the service but I was home on furlough
I came home on furlough ten years after I enlisted
Well I dont think there is
Well we dont pay a rackrent
We dont grumble about our rents
They are not very high
I have about two and ahalf acres of arable land
I took in one and a half acres myself since I came to the place and kept it for a few years but then it gave me no return
It would hardly give me the value of the seed and it was destroyed by black game and rabbits
I only keep about two and a half acres or two and a quarter acres
Yes
No I dont think they are too high rented but I dont know
But still they might raise it
That is what it means
Yes
The prices were not so good
I had two cows myself and I had to sell one of them I would get the double of the price next year for it
Yes
 As to Thomas Morrison and Angus Rankin in a case of removal Appendix No

Rankin was tenant of a lot of land at a per annum of rent
He was an old man living alone
About  he applied for and obtained permission to take in Thomas Morrison as a lodger whose wife was to keep house and attend to Rankin
This arrangement continued until  when Rankins condition from Morrisons neglect was found to be lamentable and the old man was placed under the charge of the inspector of poor who had him attended to until his death
By estate rule it is inconsistent for a man to be both a tenant and a pauper
Rankin and his lodger were therefore asked to grant a voluntary renunciation of the place that a new tenant might be selected
By advice they declinedmentioning Mr Cumming as their adviser and formal steps were taken to obtain possession
On the term day the key of the house was asked and refused
Ejectment was about to be enforced when Morrison for the first time intimated his wish to take the lot
I stopped proceedings and told Morrison the terms on which I was prepared to recommend him as tenant viz on his paying the expense of legal proceedings amounting to  That the old rent of Is would be the rent for crop or downlay  and that the new valuation of Messrs MDonald  MKenzie of  s would be his future rent for crop  and thereafter during the Dukes pleasure
He agreed to these terms at once and has continued in possession paying from and after  the rent of  s as mentioned
 The case of George MKay More Talmine
This man also occupied a lot for over forty years at Is per annum of rent
He applied for permission to take in a relative as jointtenant and successor
Consent to this arrangement was given on the condition that the new valuation of the croft  Is d per annum should be paid from and after the term of Whitsunday   when the jointtenancy began
He and his relative had free option to accept or reject this proposal
They voluntarily accepted the jointtenancy on the terms mentioned and paid the rent accordingly until  In consequence of one of Georges sons being drowned in Talmine Bay and another who went abroad not being heard of for some years by which the old man was left without help other than by his late sons widow the Duke of Sutherland has reconsidered this case and has reduced the rent to a nominal sum of s per annum on condition no other party is admitted to an interest in the lot other than his sons widow
 Case of Hugh Munro Talmine
This man occupied for a similar period at s d per annum and having made a similar request for the admission of a friend he got a similar reply
He and his friend William Munro agreed to pay the new valuation  s as from Whitsunday  and they have since regularly paid it without complaint
In each of these three cases above mentioned according to the practice of the estate no change in the rent would have been made so long as there was no change in the tenancy and so long as the sitting tenant chose to continue in possession by himself
I have to state that in  I applied for and obtained a grant of  for purchasing lime and timber by way of assisting the crofters in building division walls between their families and their cattle
The only condition required of the tenant in order to share in this grant was that he should supply the necessary labour and in cases where slates were used for new roofing of cottages they were supplied by the landlord at cost price and the tenant was allowed three or more years according to his circumstances for their repayment
These grants and the conditions on which they could be shared in are well known since  to the tenantry in this district
This allowance of  was annually continued by the Duke but for ten years the grants of lime and timber were only very partially taken advantage of by the tenants
In  the allowance was slightly exceeded but for the next five years the full amount was not applied for by the tenants
From  to  inclusive very considerable progress was made in improving existing dwellinghouses and in erecting new ones of a superior character and by way of encouraging this movement the Duke with his usual consideration for the comfort of his people more than doubled the annual allowance
For dwellinghouses of the better class the crofters were allowed from  to  bolls of lime timber for roofing flooring for parlour closet and attics partition and door standards and glass for windows slate at cost price on three or more years credit
State showing annual allowance and grants applied for from  to  is herewith submitted see Appendix No

Strathy Present rent     new valuation      Balligall      new    Brawl      new     Altiphuerst     new     Laidnagullin       new     
Yes it has always been my experience
Yes all of themcrofters and cottars and all under his care
As far as I know
There is perhaps about 
There has been a considerable reduction made to large tenants and instead of making a reduction to the small tenants the Duke has expended  this year in providing seed corn and potatoes for them
He has also given me  to lay out in works of trenching and improving their lots and one thing and another that will all be expended this year besides other works that have gone on during the year in the district
I think it is considering the rents at which the lots are let
Some of them from three to five years
I have no idea as to that
Some of them have they pay a fair rent for it just as a sporting gentleman would do
That may be in some instances but though one or two of them are getting more rent they are giving an equivalent in the shape of gardens and keepers and grazing for cows and things of that kind which are not taken into account by the public
That is so in Strath Halladale
Mr Patterson has the shooting over the ground and over the small tenants
Their ground is lying in fact in the centre of his and his ground is between them and the shore again
Sometimes he does but to a very small extent
No except Bighouse I dont know of any case in my district
I have already mentioned that in some instances that is so
But that arises very much from this that if the tenant takes the shooting along with the grazing shootings rise and fall as you know and are increasing rather than decreasing
There is more demand for them and consequently the tenant very naturally takes advantage of a rise just as the proprietor would do
I dont think it would be a good thing for them
I dont quite take in what you mean
I go further and say that the Duke has more regard for the small tenantry than he has for the large
The latter are able to help themselves and it is his duty to help the smaller class and it is my duty as a factor to carry out his wishes and to the best of my ability I do it
I dont think that could be properly done because all and sundry have an interest in the outrun and whatever might be got for it would require to be subdivided according to their several interests
I dont think it would work and I dont think as much would be got for it as would be worth the undertaking
Yes somewhere about  acres in the Tongue district
It would be so if they were all lying together but when the grazings are lying in strips here and there they are very much more disturbed than the large grazings and consequently there is not the same amount of game on them
I dont believe any body would take them alone
Yes and I think with very good reason
From first to last
It was voted to me but I did not accept it
Because I simply wished my services to be gratuitous and did not wish to introduce a bone of contention among the people
They were all very favourable to that with the exception of one man
I did not wish to have anything whatever to do with it and I shook my hands clean of it altogether
But apart from that altogether whether it was legal or illegal it was the same to me I declined it
I was from the beginning
I am
I dont know but we had no other alternative but to do it or employ a clerk from some other part and pay him for it which was adding to the rate of the parish already heavy enough
Entirely
I would be very glad to get quit of it and had it not been from a sense of duty and a wish to do what would be a benefit to the people as well as to the Duke I should have had nothing to do with it
Very few indeed
Yes
Not that I am aware of
The Dukes agent was Mr Gray latterly Mr Traquair and now Mr Tait
He has done nothing as law agent to my knowledge
No I made no reflections
I have simply stated that I had written and verbal communications to the effect that they did not represent the true interest and feeling of the population
They came by post
Yes
Yes
I dont see why not
I give no names
I dont make any reflections myself about them
It is a matter of no moment to me whether they were rightly or wrongly appointed
I dont see anything wrong in it for my part
I am quite willing to lay the letters I have received before the Commission
I have been there since I was born
Yes a long time ago
It was after Sir James time that the hill was last taken from us
Upwards of twenty years ago
Yes two or three miles of hill
Mr Sellar who was a sheep farmer there
No
Yes
Yes it was taken away from them twentysix years ago
Yes miles of it
Mr Sellar and Mr Fraser the factor
Yes  since my grandfathers time
Yes
Golspie and Embo as well
Yes
No
Yes
All kinds
Yes
John Grant fisherman Embo 
Small boats about eighteen feet keel
We cannot go far out because there is not a harbour where we can haul them up or down
No but if we could get a piece of land for our family so that we could dry our nets
I pay   or   an acre for land
No
Yes our grandfathers had land
It was taken many years ago
It was given for big farms
There is a farmer who has  acres of land
No
We have to buy it and pay for it
Four miles three miles and two milesperhaps as far as the first farm that will give it
We complain the very same
The very same
We have to go to Little Ferry and Dornoch and sometimes six or seven miles
We can use cockles but there is a great deal of labour with them
I have to be barefooted on the ground in the snow and rain and then carry the basket four miles on my back
No we could not buy them as they are so dears d a basket that is horrid it is past bearing altogether
If I paid that s d it would not pay me because perhaps I would not get a shillings worth of fish
The Duke of Sutherland has a man there
Yes
He claims them when they are on the edge of his ground
No but the Duke pays him so much a year to do so
Yes
The man gathers them but they would grow better the way they are but they are making out to claim them
Yes six or seven
Yes
It goes to the Duke
I cannot say about that but they dont want anybody to go near them at all
Yes plenty
Yes if not more
I pay d a yard for a piece six yards broad and that comes to about  s
Yes
Yes besides our own labour
Mr Polson
The best thing that could be done would be in the way of granting a proper harbour suitable for the two villages and at the same time to allow them an allotment of land
There is something on a very small scale
No it is done altogether through some gentlemen who are interested in the fishermen of both places
Yes
I have not the slightest doubt we are willing to pay for the harbour
Yes
The boats are now perfect shells and very dangerous indeed
No they cannot come in
At Embo the boats require to be drawn down  yards till they reach the water
Ever so much because they have harbours in other places and here they have not
I can hardly answer the question but it is really a sad state of matters
I cannot answer that
The men are often very tired and in going out again they require to get out to the boats dry
Not many of them
Yes
Grievance as to the State of Education in the Parish of Rogart
As a member of the School Board of Rogart for the last nine years and chairman of the present board I beg to submit to you Royal Commissioners a grievance which has seriously affected the education of the young in the parish
During the nine years ending June  the factor of the Duke of Sutherland was chairman of the School Board
Among the first acts of the first board elected under the Education Act of  was the decision that the parish which had always three schools should be put upon two
The chairman invariably managing to have a majority of the board to follow him in every proposal moved and carried that a school in the north part of the parish should be closed and that the children should be compelled to go down to the old parochial school in the centre of the parishan unreasonable distance
The parents and ratepayers joined the minority of the board against this finding and appealed to the Board of Education
An officer of inquiry who by order of the Board of Education visited the district reported in the same line as the minority of the board that the proceeding of the School Board was injurious to the interests of education in the district
The Board of Education acting upon this report at once recommended the School Board to reopen the closed schooL The Board of Education failing to get the local board to comply with its decision sent down its secretary Dr Taylor August  who after visiting said district peremptorily ordered this school to be reopened which was accordingly done
Previously to this quarrel between the chairman of the board and the people of the district this house had been offered by the authorities to the people at a rent of  a year but ever since this quarrel took place the rent charged is   annually
Another contention originating in the same way but proving much more serious arose respecting the west end of the parish in the district of Strath fleet
Two old school buildings existed in this district within   miles of each other
They were both unfit for the teaching of children under the Act  with a view to obtain the Government grant
But notwithstanding this the chairman of the board moved that the public school in the district should be taught in one of thesethe one further westwhich was accordingly done in the face of a protesting minority of the School Board the earnest petitions and remonstrances of the parents and ratepayers of the district and the recommendations of the Board of Education
Instead of this there should have been erected a new school in a central part of the district as was strongly recommended by the Board of Education which would be accessible to all the children of the district
The building in which the school was now taught had to be repaired year after year but as regularly it was found wanting by Her Majestys inspector
The repeated directions of the Board of Education to build a house halfway between the two old schools were persistently ignored
At last when the old house in the west was utterly condemned by the local architect the board led by its chairman setting all remonstrances at defiance transferred the school to the other old building to the east of the district
This placed the school beyond the reach of the children in the west of the Strath
The house was repaired by the board but did not satisfy the inspector
The singular thing is that the board used public money in this and in the other house west to improve private property
As the school was now so far away the children did not come to it
To punish them for not coming all the distance the board wished them it was moved th February  by the chairman and as a matter of course carried that the parents of said children should be prosecuted
This was done and the issues of it were that the people thus treated were wounded to the core with indignation at the conduct of the board for the insult which was added to the injury done to their children and the board had to pay  in the form of law expenses
As the only dissentient from this decision of the board to prosecute these people I submitted my reasons for so doing when the chairman without consulting any member of the board threw the paper which contained my reasons of dissent aside
I remonstrated with him for this and stated that I would report his the chairmans oppressive and tyrannical conduct in the School Board to his noble master the Duke of Sutherland whereupon he called me by an unworthy epithet and lifted his stick evidently threatening physical violencewhich attitude coupled with the wellknown fact that he can use his hand with effect when it serves his purpose I confess I shook all over as I never did before any man before
The irrecoverable loss thus sustained by the children of the district in question irritated the people so much that their indignation at the factors policy in the board was to a considerable extent the cause of the riot on the occasion of the case of forcible eviction in said district last year
The perpetual quarrels in the board the loss sustained by the children the unfair way of spending the money of the ratepayers all led the leaders of the people in the Established and Free Church congregations to take this matter in hand and deemed it prudent in the interests of all that the factor should be left out at last triennial election
The new board thus elected at once proceeded to arrange for a new school being built for the district in a central and suitable locality
After a protracted and unseemly struggle with the authorities a site at last has just been obtained for the school
If this had been done ten years ago it would have saved much money to the ratepayers considerable illfeeling in the whole place and above all irrevocable loss to the children
I respectfully submit thatother things being equalseeing the Duke of Sutherland hath such interest at stake in education over his extensive estate I would as a matter of fair play have his representative in every School Board in the county
Yes other things being equal but I am sorry to say that they are not but most unequal
While his Grace chooses to have men representing him cannot act in a gentlemanly manner who cannot treat those with whom they have to deal but as inferiors I say to all who have respect for themselves and regard for the prosperity of their children let them not allow a factor to rule in a school board
Two great evils beset this management of this vast estate one is the absence of the proprietor and his commissioner for ten months of the year and the other is to leave the whole estate in the charge of men who are out of all sympathy with the people they have to govern
These men owing to their knowledge of the work and the ignorance of the superior authorities of it by reason of their absence from the county are practically irresponsible
It is now composed of parties in the parish
They are all in the parish except one gentleman
He was elected purposely to assist us to get a site in a suitable districtto get this new building to which I have referred erected
They are tenants crofters
Yes they are all crofters except myself and another gentleman from the adjoining parish
There are two clergymen on the board and three crofters making five in all
A clergyman
The Free Church
Yes
Quite so
Yes
In order that the exposure thus made may be a check upon such a system whether amongst us again or in any other parish because we find an exposure of these things is the very best check to put upon them
I am hoping to see a way out
They have
Materially
Yes
I think as you are sitting for the other grievances this being such a serious grievance for so long and not a solitary instance it was desirable you should know this
It will have a lasting effect because the children lost their education and they cannot get it again
The first paper put into my  is unauthenticated by the signature of any person
I have read it  carefully and I find it is nothing but a tissue of falsehoods
That I deny
The ground officer is here to confirm what I say
None not an atom
They have not been deprived of a single yard of common pasture or arable land
No increase of rental
The old rent was continued
No and I do not believe it
Yes I saw it
Never I never heard of it or any person on the estate
Never
Never
There is no tenant alive on the estate that knows anything about it it is dated so far back
No and never intimated to me and I dont know whom it would apply to
That is not the fact
My father died in  and I succeeded him in the factorship
He had a farm but shortly after his death it was given up and was never held in my name
No
My mother succeeded my father in it and upon her death it was given up
I would not take it myself
It was a small sheep farm
There are two sheep farms in addition to the crofts
I brought a gentleman from Rossshire two months ago to go over these crofts and he is willing to be examined and give his opinion of the comfort in which he found every tenant on the estate and no grievance stated either to him at the time or to any other person on behalf of Lady Matheson who has had it for the last five years
Yes
It was no part of his lease and he took possession without any intimation to Lady Matheson or to me as factor
He took violent possession of that bit of ground and commenced to trench it
It did not form part of his holding
I deny that
I dont believe there was six acres
I knew no arable land there in my time and that goes back not only to the fifty years I had charge of the estate but to ten years before when I knew it
Yes
Never I never heard of it
I know that I planted it myself in the year  and it might have been thinned and was thinned but it was under the charge of the ground officer and he never employed any people on the estate for any work except the tenants themselves that were willing to work
I know the man John Ross one of the most indolent tenants on the estate
No
There was thinning carried on by the people on the estate
I never heard of them
There may have been but I never heard of them
There were always both small tenants and large tenants in my recollection
There may have been evictions  years ago but I had not arrived in this country at that time to know anything at all about them
I dont know anything at all about them
I dont know I never heard of them
I have answered thatnot a single yard
Perfectly confident of that
They came into possession in
That was what I alluded to as not belonging to his croft at all
He usurped and took possession of that ground and he was stopped
Besides it was part of the common pasture belonging to the whole tenants
Yes
General business
I sell both
No except a garden
Yes
I have a lease
I built the house myself
I do
Ninetynine years
Yes
Yes in villages especially
 s for the feu
Not a quarter of an acre
It is a stone and lime house cottage shape and slated
No
About ten years
Yes a little
Perhaps they dont purchase more but I believe I have more customers
I believe they are much about the same
Very much the same
Yes
I dont think so
I think it is much about the same
Yes
I think it is much about the same
I cannot say I have
I think it is much about the same as it was at first
Yes
I dont think they are better I would not like to say they are much worse but I dont think they are better
I dont think they are much worse
They have to depend chiefly upon their crofts but of course they have to work for a certain part of the year where they can get work
No
Yes than they did a long time ago
I am not very well acquainted with that as I dont buy and sell cattle
Yes
Yes
I do
Yes
There may be something in that too
No I cannot speak of that
Yes
They are reliable
No one is dead
No a house was built for them afterwards a better house I understand
I think so
I cannot say but it is not likely
Yes they had the croft
A neighbouring crofter
I do
If you will allow me I will just give you the explanation which the crofters wished me to give before the Commissioners
Parish of Rogart Sutherlandupper portion of the parish
The crofters of Rogart respectfully desire to state to Her Majestys Commissioners that they held a general meeting on the th June to discuss their grievances and made an application to the Commission for an inquiry into them
Another general meeting was held afterwards to consider the reply of the Commissioners and to discuss the best mode in which their grievances could be represented before the Commission when it was resolved that the parish be divided into three divisions and each of these to elect its own representatives
Consequent upon this resolution district meetings were held a few days afterwards at Torbreac Public School Rogart Public School and at Rhilochan Public School
At each of these meetings several delegates were appointed to represent each district but at a subsequent meeting on having further information from the Commission and having regard to the limited time the Commissioners could devote to hearing evidence from the representatives of four parishes in one day the subject of delegates was reconsidered and it was finally resolved that the number of delegates be reduced to two one for the lower portion of the parish and one for the upper that John Sutherland merchant Pittertrail be the representative of the crofters in the lower portion of the parish comprising the townships of Achoillie Achvrail Ardachadh Junisdeape Cluaranaich Junisoraig Dalmore Muie Blarich Torbreac Pitfure and Pittentrail and John Mackay Achellach be the representative of the upper comprising the townships of Rhilium Rhimusaig Phichalmia Little Rogart Meikle Rogart Achcook Cnocarthur Rhilochan Tanachy Dalreavich Bauscoll Craggie Beg Craggie Mor East and West Langwell Breacachadh and Morness
These two representatives were considered sufficient upon the consideration above stated and for the additional consideration that the grievances complained of were generally of the same nature in all the townships and the remedies thought necessary were the same all round
The above townships contain nearly two hundred crofters lots and families paying upwards of  rental or an average of  s each
There are two tenants paying  six   one   one  one   four  three   three  s seven   one  s seven   five  s eight   three  s twentyseven  nine  s twentynine  five  s thirtythree   eight  s nineteen  The grievances complained of are too small holdings insufficient for the subsistence of a family and  bring it up in the way Highlanders always desired to do
Hill pasture too scant and too restrictedin some places taken from the crofters to be added to that of the large farmers
Boundaries generally unfenced
Rents generally considered too high and frequently raised without notice particularly upon a son succeeding a parent notwithstanding that the son might be the improver and not the father
It frequently happens that the mother survives the father
The son remaining with the mother makes most of the improvements himself and when he succeeds the mother the rent is invariably raised in many instances from  to  per cent and more as for example s to s s to ls s d to  s to s
Numerous other instances could be produced
Crofters rents are paid in advance
The mode of rentraising upon holdings reclaimed by the crofters themselves from moor and other equally sterile land
The houses and steadings being also built by themselves often at a cost they could not afford nor bear if they were not assisted by their sons and daughters in the south of Scotland and in the colonies
The tenure being uncertain acts detrimentally upon their minds and prevents many of them from effecting improvements and thereby incur the odium of idleness
Lots falling vacant are given to strangers in preference to natives of the parish who are able and willing to take them
The parish of Rogart contains  acres  of which are occupied by fifteen large farmers paying an aggregate rent of  while about  crofters pay upwards of  for the  acres they occupy making d an acre for the large farmers and s d for the crofters
One half of the arable land now occupied by the crofters has been reclaimed by themselves within the last forty years
Previous to that date they were so stunned and disheartened by the terror created by the evictions that very little reclamation of land or any other improvement was effected
The population of the parish within the last fifty years has decreased from  to  chiefly by voluntary emigrations to various parts of the world
During the eviction years no less than  families in the parish were displaced most of them wedged in amongst crofters in townships which did not covet the notice of these large farmers who then came into the county with the object of obtaining sheep runs
There are three sheep farms in the parish the number of families displaced for them was in one case fiftytwo in another fortythree in the third fortyfive
The result of this displacement is seen to this day in the congestion of the population in various townships particularly in Little Rogart Meikle Rogart Cnocarthurand other places adjacent
The number of lots being now double what it was in  the result of this congestion being that while the arable land was increased by reclamation to provide food for subsistence hillpasture such as it is and so necessary for summer pasture has been diminished and is now insufficient for the horses cattle and sheep which must be kept for the consumption of the provender grown and the maintenance of the people in the means of paying their rents and providing themselves with necessaries of life education food and clothing
The remedies the people of Rogart desire to be applied are compensation for improvements effected by themselves security of tenure more hill pasture and more land capable of cultivation to do away with the congestion enforced from them by the evictions
They beg most respectfully to submit these considerations to Her Majestys Commissioners
They desire to say that they in common with their countrymen in other parts of the Highlands have sad recollections and woeful tales to tell of evictions and burnings and other harsh proceedings at that time and since
That hitherto they have submitted quietly and submissively to much suffering they now hope that brighter days may shine upon them that repression and oppression by factors shall cease and that the ancient feelings of reciprocal attachment and affection once the pride of the Sutherland tenantry and that bound chiefs and retainers in a great and grand whole may again be restored and revived to be a source of contentment and happiness conducive to the best interests and prosperity of all and a strength to the nation
Yes
Yes
In the parish of Rogart entirely
Twenty
During the last fourteen years I think it is only twice I had been in it before  or  but since then I have came once or twice every year
I am more particularly acquainted with the upper parts of the parish
It is in the upper part of the parish I was born and I seldom visited other parts unless going along the road
I do
The figures are to be depended upon
The information about the townships can easily be seen on the Ordnance maps and I got from two of the oldest men in the parish their statements and I simply copied them
There has been a great deal of land reclaimed
In fact the crofters were obliged to reclaim merely for subsistence
I recollect the parish forty years ago and when I left it I dont think there was half the land then under cultivation that there is now
I have not seen in any portion of the county of Sutherland so much improvement made and entirely by the crofters themselves and at their own expense
A few of them may have obtained what has been said by some here to be Government money but with  per cent charged for the money the expenses of reclaiming the land in the parish of Rogart is so excessive that it will never repay them
The crofters must do it themselves at odd timesthat is to say when not busy with their spring and harvest work
Trenching the land
Every yard must be trenched and generally they trench it from  to  inches deep and it produces such a crop of stones as would surprise anybody
When I came into the parish being attached to the parish I wished to make improvements so as to ameliorate their own lot
I have been persuading many of them to work in the winter and reclaim land where they can do it
One man in particular I asked to start and reclaim half an acre and as it would cost  I said I would give  towards it I advised him that it should be let by contract to a man to reclaim the place and blast the stones out of it
When it was done the half acre cost  and seeing the cost was enormous instead of confining myself to  I gave the man 
Not on the sheep farms in the parish of Rogart
No
I should say so
No no
I mean the other way and it can be proved and I defy any one to disprove the figures I have given you
I measured the extent of the parish as given in the Ordnance map acres
I measured all the land in the occupation of the crofters paying under 
Well I did not
The d includes the arable land held by the large fanners
Rogart farm pays  that is included in the d
 Dallebeg pays 
I am not able to say that of my own knowledge but I have heard it said repeatedly and I believe it to be a fact and I think the proprietor is quite well aware of it
I have heard himself say it
Certainly
Why this county at any time before the evictions could raise  men
At the time of the French Revolution this county raised  men and when they were away defending their country they behaved themselves well on the field of battle
They were fighting against the Irish rebels and one of the Sutherland regiments of Fencibles defeated the Irish rebels on Tara hill though they were only one to ten and I say on national grounds that men are better than sheep
I have no detestation of sheep or of deer
Deer forests were in this country from time immemorial
There are tracts of land which are worth nothing except for deer but I object entirely upon national grounds that land capable of cultivation or of supporting sheep should be put under deer
We may go too far and find ourselves as Rome found itself when it was invaded with no Romans left to resist the Goths and Vandals
I had not the figures by me but I believe it is not quite so long ago
It does not
Every young lad in the parish of Rogart almost as soon as he attains eighteen or twenty goes off because it is better for him
He is starving at home and there is not subsistence enough to maintain a family of six or seven
Not the slightest and I advise every boy who has pluck in him to go to New Zealand or the colonies and if the authorities of this country dont take thought and mend it will be better for the whole population
No man should conceal that from himself
No doubt if a family left and their lot were added to another one of the houses would be useless and it might be used for an outhouse
I dont think they are so quiet
They have been of late years irritated to such a degree that a rebellious spirit has arisen in the minds of the people
They have been irritated
In former years they were as submissive as quiet and as good people as could be found in the whole of Great Britain and when I sometimes go and listen to the feelings of irritation they give expression to I simply am surprised and wish myself back in my own home
It is lower since my time
The Education Actinefficient teaching
In my time I learned Latin Greek and all that and so did every one of my brothersand algebra mathematics and bookkeeping
They work for results for money results and the standard of education of the teachers themselves is not so high as it was in my time
Certainly not in my estimation
Well there were two schools in the parish when I was a boy
Certainly the number is sufficient
A great deal of good
The first lad taken in hand was an orphan boy
He was sent to Aberdeen Grammar School so as to qualify himself
The education he would receive in the board school was not sufficient
He was sent to the Aberdeen Grammar School
The first year he was there he gained a bursary of  tenable for two years
That relieved the funds of the association and enabled them to take another
That same boy entered the university and is now an MA
Others have been sent to the Aberdeen Grammar School to qualify themselves for teaching
We assist not only boys but girls and recently the funds of the association being sufficient if there are boys who have a predilection for trade such as masons and so on we provide them with money to assist them
So the association does not exactly help them to education alone but education alone is the prime object
Yes
I may mention the test applied for the election of these boys or girls
There is an examination every year and prizes are given by the association and the boy who wins the first prize is assisted to go forward and the same with the girls
No doubt in the fencible regiments they were raised by what I call conscription and when the rd was raised first in  it was certainly by conscription
If a father had three sons two were demanded and if he had two sons one was demanded
Our township was required to furnish a rough census of those who were of the age for soldiers and there was simply the order sent and they were obliged to go
There is not a doubt about it and his Grace of Sutherland admitted that to me last night
I dont think so
I dont think any letter can be found now but General Stewart in his Sketches of Highland Character and Highland Regiments has several pages where he descants on the rd
Certainly
Yes
Oh dear yes
Some came back when they were dischargedthe wounded especially who fell at the battle of New Orleans where the rd was more than decimated
There were three hundred and fifteen soldiers killed or wounded at New Orleans many of these returned and one of them was an uncle of my father
He was discharged with a pension of d a day
No land could be found for him and he was shoved in with another on a little lot at Pitfour and after being there twelve or fourteen years he went off to America
I dont know of any people in the country who have such a military tendency and I dont know of any men in the country who would learn the drill so soon
The military spirit in the olden times before  was extraordinarily strong in Sutherland
Why my own father enlisted three times before he was accepted as a soldier and I myself if my father had allowed me to go on my own hook would have been a soldier at this day
My predilection was to be a soldier and so it is with my children
Some few years ago the rd was quartered at Woolwich and always taking an interest in my own county men I felt a very great interest in the rd and went down to look at them on a Sunday
I visited them in their quarters and I found only one man in the regiment who could speak Gaelicthat man being a Sutherland man
One is the passive resistance in the minds of the people
They say  Let the Duke take his sheep to defend the country
Yes admirable
I dont think they are
There was a Rogart boy in the nd killed in the last Afghan war
Yes I hope so
Harshness on the part of the factor himself and unconciliatory conduct towards the families and so much is that carried out that he will take a stick and turn them out of his office and any factor who would lift a stick to break the ministers head is surely not fit for his office
The population complain more
I have heard it for the last ten vears
I do and I hope  shall have the pleasure of meeting the Commissioners in Edinburgh
They began sooner in various parts
The parish of Rogart was I believe the first touched and they extended to Assynt from that they came to the upper parts of Brora and they began with the terrible doings in Strathnaver
Yes the first evictions began under Lord Reay
Not since  or  Enough had been done and no more could be done
No
Not to any extent
You have heard at Helmsdale of the grazings taken away
Instances of that have occurred
No I dont think so and I am unwilling to believe it
We are always hoping there may be a rift in the sky and that the silver lining may come to be seen on the edge of it
We hope for that
I do or at least I hope I do
Perhaps the hope may give rise to it but I think it is sincere
People are more listened to now
They are more manly and make themselves respected and by making themselves respected very likely they will obtain better redress
I hope so and I think there is and I think that will be seen and very soon
I think that would be unwise
To rehabilitate the people and put them in what may be termed a good position would I am sure take twenty years unless the Duke of Sutherland lives to a good old age it will not be done in his time unless he goes at it in a magnificent and princely way as he did at the commencement
I am positively certain of it
The people only want to see a manifestation of a change of policy and they will be as quiet and submissive as ever they were before
I think so and that immediately
Very strong indeed
There are some of them here now
The people of Rogart cannot believe that the Duke can do any harm
They impute all the woes and cruelty and repression they talk about to the Dukes officials
The Duke in their opinion can do no wrong
Rheanbreck
Yes
 I am a native of this parish and have always resided in it
I occupy the croft which my mother held for which she only paid s d until I improved some of the waste ground to arable land it was rented to her at  then and when I got my name in the rental book it was rented at  and now I pay  I am put forward to represent Rheanbreok and Tomich district in which there are twenty crofters
We have to complain of the smallness of our holdings especially of Rheanbreck
Of late years the railway passed through our lots and deprived us of part of the best of our land and that without any reduction of rent or compensation for our labour but the following summer we were made to pay for the grass growing inside the fence opposite each croft so that we pay double rent for that portion where the railway went through
Then iu  nine of us were deprived of the lower parts of our lots to the average of about three or four acres each of which a good deal was under cultivation for which we received no compensation or reduction of rent but three who got a few shilling off their rent
This land taken from us was for the new farm of Ballone
The land in our township has a northern exposure and was valued some years ago at a higher rate per acre than the southern exposure on the opposite side of the valley some of us being valued at about s per acre and the opposite side which is much better land for crops at about s per acre
The rent of Rheanbreck is  We had to pay last year for meal  s for seed oats  s hay and straw for wintering  s lime for land  s manure for land  s outlay  s
Our income for cattle sold  s sheep sold  s pigs sold s  income s   deficiency  s
To make up this deficiency we have to work wherever we get it to do and what we earn elsewhere is swallowed up to keep our lots and families together
Both townships have too little pasture and the grazing on it is very inferior and the stock on it the same as it is surrounded by sheep farms and there being no march fence between us and the farms our stock do not get the same justice as they would if there was a fence
Should we make improvements on houses or land we have no guarantee that we can reap the benefit of such labour as we have no hold upon our lots further than the goodwill of the proprietor and we can get no compensation for such improvements if we were to leave
Other crofters or tenants
Yes
No but I object to the rent of our own for it is of different quality
The land is worse
The climate is bad and the soil is bad
Yes
Yes
Ball and Kinvonie
Four acres of arable land but there is more enclosed in the fence that cannot be arable land for it is rocks and stones
Yes with the exception of the sowing of three bushels of oats
That is what my mother would sow
None at all it was a waste place
Never
She was removed from another place to make a large place and she was put there to make a living and most that are on that side were put there for that purpose
Yes but I have more that I took in since that of arable land for which I got Government money
 was the standard put on by the valuators and   was put on by Government
 I drew out of the office for trenching
Much about the same till we come to Tomich
They are larger in Tomich
Yes
We are valuing it at about s
Well of the kind we have I keep two cows but it would not keep one right cow because the other cows would not live in the place we are in for want of pasture and winter feeding
Yes little wee Highland things
Yes the same
In  I think
Out of the tenants pasture and arable
On our side it was arable and pasture mixed but on the Ballone side it was pasture
Yes the crofters had it all in possession between them
I am told it was well on to  acres between  and  acres
Not very large
I am told it is s per acre
To Mr Crawford hotelkeeper at Lairg
Yes he has an arable farm at Lairg too
About one acre of arable land but then we had more of pasture that was not cultivated at the time and that was as good
Some of them more
At my side there was more and there was one man who lost nearly all he had
He had his arable land below the line and he got a piece above it to take it out of the rocks and stones the best way he could
I have made a representation and others have too for a reduction of rent but Mr Peacock said it was not his fault but it was the valuators fault to raise the rent to that and he could not reduce it
One Mr Mackenzie from Inverness
Well I have to work wherever I get it
No
No
There were two or three years when work was going on very brisk when his Grace was going on with reclamations but that is all finished
There has been no work since two years ago
They must do so
No
They were removed from other parts of the parish
They were not able to keep the lots they had at  the time and they were put to that place
Some from Strathnaver and some from Kildonan
There were three families sent from Strathnaver at the time of the sheep coming there
My father did not live with my mother at the time
Yes from the far east end of the place
That place was made too large for her and a smaller place came in to her to make a living of
She always lived in the same township
Never
Never
A long strip
s d
From year to year
Her sister and herself
It was themselves that did all that was done of it till I came to maturity
Yes
Yes
I did myself
It was a long time
I am safe in saying twenty years
Because I improved some land and they were saying it was too much value for s d
I have improved altogether about five acres between Government money and at my own expense
Three acres
Yes
To   for the whole
Yes
It was s d for the whole lot at first
Yes
A year before that
She was for me getting my name put on

A little over four acres
There is another  put on since for the improvement money
 towards five acres
Over fifty years
Yes
None at all but the 
Government money for which we pay Is a pound
A common stone and lime thatched house
Yes at one end
Something about 
Yes
Yes
On both sides
There was a water going through the centre and the one part was on the Ballone side and the other on the Rheanbreck side of the farm and the farm is made up of these two sides put together the Ballone side being pasture and our side both pasture and arable
From the most on our side
Never a penny
No
Yes
It is large but it is not good
Be has got a plantation that is next it between his two farms at the same rent and has that for pasture
Yes when it was planted it was taken from them
No
The farmer was giving it to them for so much per month for some of their cattle and horses
Both arable and pasture
Never
I am certain on our side with the exception that two or three got a few shillings
On the low part that was taken from them
For the farm
I am not very sure
Yes
Yes
No
Nothing
No
Yes we have seen a case of that kind in our neighbourhood and when he came on them for valuation when his lease was out he would get no more from the estate
Yes
I am not very sure
I dont believe it
Not at all
There were some lots he did not see at all
I am told he passed without looking at them
Yes we would expect that
No
About a mile
Yes in one sense
The low parts were taken from us and there is no occasion for a crossing
There were crossings put in at first and we had them for a few years but then the land was taken for a farm and the crossings were closed
Yes
Yes
The very best of it from the one end to the other
No
No but before then we were promised to get a reduction for it before the railway came through but we never got it
A man from Dunrobinfrom the Duke
No not for that
Yes
Between three and four acres some of them three and others four not arable land but altogether
There were nine of them
We have not measured what was taken for the railway but very much more than was required for  the fence has come out too far on our cultivated land
The best way we canhere and there not in one place at all
Sometimes according as it turns out
s d when we get it
We are as often without it as with it
Well it is a hardship for we lose the work on the crofts
Well we dont get work but very seldom since two or three years ago
Not since some years back
I was forced to go myself once or twice but there was no work in Lairg till the reclamations commenced and the railway came on
No but we do not get it except very seldom
Most of us
There were good wages going there
Yes
Yes

I have
I did not count them but there was a large assemblage
The grievance of the crofters of the township of Gruids is the smallness of their crofts both arable and pasture
The overcrowding of the township is mainly due to the Clunel evictions sixty years ago to make room for sheep
The crofters had reclaimed the land and built houses thereon at their own expense and were paying rent to the amount of   annually being a higher rent than ever paid since
When in our present factors possession he had it for   a year
This certainly wounded the feelings of the evicted crofters and their descendants to see the land from which they were ruthlessly driven in possession of the factor for less rent
Twentysix years ago miles of pasture were taken off the crofters without any reduction of rent being given as well as depriving them of the work done on the estate which made their grievances twofold
The factors practice was to send men from Dornoch to do all the work while all the men of Gruids were allowed to go idle still their rents would require to be paid otherwise they would be threatened with eviction or their effects poinded
We have neither lease nor valuation given us or encouragement of any kind
We have to pay for the smallest piece of wood we require for houses fences c
The crofts we occupy will hardly keep meal to each of us for six months and for most no work on the estate to assist us for the remainder of the year
The first evictions carried into effect on this estate commenced about seventy years ago
Some of the evicted got crofts in Clunel from which they were again evicted in the course of twelve years to the township of Gruids others having to leave for foreign countries and a third eviction was attempted on the township of Gruids
The above evictions were cruelly brought about
The people were forced out of their houses by a military force and had to take to the hills
Old men and children were nearly starved in snow on their return
After the departure of the soldiers they found that they had no houses to shelter them for the night besides taking some that turned back to save their effects prisoners
The land from which those crofters were evicted amounts to about one thousand acres for which the tacksman pays about sixpence an acre on an average with hill pasture while we pay s d an acre for ours which is of very inferior quality and all improved at our own expense
We are informed that there is a law in our country to protect us but when such oppression as described in the above is in force we find no protection whatsoever from the present law
Therefore we earnestly advocate a thorough reform of the land laws
In advance of the Royal Commission we had our winter stock taken up by the ground officer which could not be done with justice to us as we have to buy yearly for our winterstock
Second we had a onesided valuation in the month of August when the crop looked at its best never considering the amount of artifacial manure c yearly laid on our unproductive soil and then they think to oppress us as has been done in the past
Yes
Yes
Sir George Gunn Munro of Poyntsfield
Not at all
It was all in the possession of the crofters the whole place at that time was in their possession
Yes
No I suppose they were evicted first and both the arable and pasture combined were formed into a farm
They had both in their possession until such time as they were evicted
Yes
No they were removed to Clunel and some went further
We have one here who can substantiate that statement
No it is made into two farms
I can hardly state that but I believe there is a man here who can state it
They were not given to people of Sutherland
Certainly they were given to strangers
Sixty years ago
A most cruel eviction
I mean that
To the township of Gruids and they are here today to prove it
Shortly after the same time
None at all
I think it will be about forty years ago
There were no evictions since then
Sir George Gunn Munro
None whatever
It has been taken off them miles of it
Yes
Yes
It was added to a sheep farm and part of it eighty acres is planted
None whatever
None whatsoever
Mr Sellar
No not at all
That is a different part of which I am talkingtwentysix years ago
I dont know
Mr Fraser
No he is not
Seven years
Yes
Angus Bethune residing in Inverness
The manager or a man in partnership with him
But I have a letter from Mr Bethune to the effect that he was misled in his offer for the farm for he thinks it too dear and certainly it is not out of place to think it too dear when we pay s d for ours
None whatsoever
Well I think the largest is eighteen acres three poles
But it is in the possession of the ground officer as they have the fat of the landall those officials
That is the point of the letter
The fact is that the largest who has arable land pays about s d
William Black
I did not make up that but the average rent is about  s
There are about  acres of arable land altogether and twentyeight crofters
Rather over seven
No it is bad hill pasture
It amounts to  acres
Both cattle and sheep and horsesin fact too much
I have only two myself
I cannot say what the rest have but the quality of the sheep is such that they are nearly turned into goats for the want of pasture and the one must rise before the other lies down
I cannot exactly say
I did not study that point
I believe there would be
A horse
I know some that are only paying  have twentyfour sheep but that is on account of the estate regulations not being carried into effect 
That is what we should have
The officials
They do not look to that
They allow some to keep twentyfour sheep upon whereas I pay s d and have only two sheep
Say a dozen sheep
The estate regulations carry twosheep to the   but that is too much for the extent of pasture we have
None whatever
Yes
They got six weeks of Government money for what improvements they would do within the six months and they have been paying for thirtyfive years interest for the said money so I believe they have done it all upon their own account
All finished within six weeks were paid Government money
Some did improvements and some none at all
Yes too hardly
It is fenced on either side
Yes
Yes but it keeps us out of occupation of the land which we  should have had and which our forefathers had and which they had for sixpence an acre and which we pay s d for
It includes all the arable land our forefathers tilled and gave to him in good order
There has been  acres cultivated
No it is all grown with bracken and ferns and rushes
It will soon be a wilderness altogether and a loss to the nation
Yes
Yes
Well I did not do it at the present time because I was not there
I was in Inverness but if I was at home I would not give them the privilege of numbering my stock because I would think it was an imposition
I would not do anything against that
If that is the fact it was all right
Five years
He did
He had a letter to that effect
I am not sure
He is here present
But I know there is a gross injustice in the manner in which he has been treated
He has been a man that paid far more for his mill and land than any of those before him paid and a persevering man and he should be encouraged instead of oppressed
I understand that exactly because the law is upon his side and it is an unjust law and that he has the power in his own hand of selfcontrol and he can do with the land what he pleases
Well I have stated there that he does not get a larger rent
Because it is not in accordance with his own mind
Yes but my statement does not confirm that I say he gets a less rent for his land
Because he wishes to exclude us from the face of the earth and send us over the ocean
I can see no other reason for it
It is his object
I cannot arrive at it but I know there is gross injustice to us on that part
No he would not
Yes and there is a demand for any land
I think he could
There are only two
There are Messrs Dobie and Martin and Mr Angus Bethune Inverness
There are twentyeight and there is a population of  upon that small piece of ground  acres
A few shepherds
Messrs Dobie and Martin do not reside at all upon the land
They reside in Dumfriesshire
There are six or seven
I cannot exactly say but there will be about 
Yes
Nearly the whole  acres
 altogether
Arable and pasture combined
There is only one now but till the last year there were a good many
Certainly and they were put in defiantly against the crofters
I suppose they were in favour with the factor and ground officer and were put upon the tenants pasture and at present they are the best off in the whole township
Yes I believe I am quite justified in stating that
I suppose there would be no harm in referring to this letter which I received from Mr Bethune and you can judge a little from that which will confirm so much of my statement
Mr MGregor
I cannot exactly state
That is too far back but I have men present who can state it
Yes
The farm of Clunel
Yes
I dont know
I think it would need to be a pretty small one
There might be reasons but I cannot arrive at them assuredly but he was a banker at Dornoch and there might be bills in his bank and if he sent men up who had bills in his bank he could redeem them
But the tenants were kept out of employment as well as the pasture was taken off
 I George Gunn Munro proprietor of the estate Poyntsfield and Gruids bind myself and my heirs and successors whomsoever to pay melioration to the small tenants on Clunel and Pitarvie Terry Mill or any other stances thereabout for any neat stone and lime cottages byres barns c and stone dykes they may build which shall be paid them at whatever period they may remove or be removed the value of what they may be worth at outgoing to be ascertained by judges mutually chosen this is provided all such will be finished by learned tradesmen
And as a further encouragement will make a present of a guinea note to each of tenants of six first finished with chimneys at each end of their said houses
Given under my hand Poyntsfield House on this th day of August  and a separate letter to the above agreement will be given to each separately as their houses are finished signed GEORGE GUNN MUNRO
Yes
The old proprietor fell into debt and the estate was entailed and he rented the Gruids tenants to the highest they could go and they remain there yet and all the privilege he gave them is taken away from them
The hill pasture is taken away and eighty acres of plantation is put there and there was more poiuted out last week which I could not get in my statement and in the face of all this I see Lady Matheson is again pointing out some pasture to be planted
Exactly and it is one thing certain that with the privileges there stated and the miles of pasture we had we must be in a worse state now than we were then
None
None at all not even a handstake out of the wood and that is little enough
None whatever
There has been no reduction of rent for all the bad years and the game going away with the half of our crop
There has been nothing done whatever
They have been all built of that quality
Altogether with the exception of one or two
I cannot answer that question directly
Certainly
Yes none whatever
They refuse it altogether
No
The excuse they put to us was that it was not stamped
It is the same township but a different part of the township
The walls are good but they are not capable of keeping out the rain
Surely it must be
There is nothing they can keep them watertight with
They are thatched houses
There is no slate
They are built of stone and lime walls
They have nothing to renew it with unless they use their straw and that curtails their provender for their cattle
It was turf
No
Because it is not there
Turf
That might last for a year or so but whenever the turf is done it is as bad as ever
We do as much as we can
But whatever can be done without the houses being slated they will not be watertight
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Some of them are higher and some lower
No
No I dont think it
The factor requested three of them to sign a document giving over their claim and promised the piece we all occupy between us to the three men if they would sign a document that they had no claim on the rest
No when they signed it he gave as good a right to the whole as to these three men
No the land we now occupy was promised to three men if they gave over their claim to the rest
Yes
William Black The factor could not bribe the others
John Ross
The whole tenants
Part of it
Yes
Yes
Part of it we got back
To the one part
The half was to be taken off
They were to sign a document that they were willing to give away the half of it if they got the other half of it among the three of them
No
The factor and Mr Sellar
No it was not a practice but it was done on the estate
It was done once
No it was done once
More than one man but only in one year
Yes
Yes
No black game and grouse
The whole of us do not complain of it but some of us who are near the wood and in a late season there is a great deal of damage done by game
No
Between himself and Mr Sellar
Yes
Yes our hill pasture was between theirsa strip straight between theirs
Yes and so it did
I am not exactly sure
I was not of age at the time
I have only other mens statements
It would be worth sixpence an acre to us
No there is a considerable amount
William Black
There are more than  acresfour or five miles of pasture
Yes we have only a small piece in comparison to what we had
John Ross
Yes in labouring work
 Yes
Most of them
I did not but others did
Yes to the factor
William Black
We were denied any reduction whatever
No not any
No
No
Although you would pay interest for it you will not get it
I have offered that
John Ross
No none whatever
Yes
I think she was of the mind to plant it
That is my belief
She is planting quite close to it
It might for a very short time but that would not last as long as the pasture
Not any permanent employment
No not at all
William Black
Oh there is nothing whatsoever
Well we are not so much against plantations as we are against deer forests and sheep farming but at the same time when it comes to taking away our small piece of pasture and we think it a great grievance because although we get a few days work there we lose it altogether in the future
I believe so and I think it is but justice to us that are natives of the soil and loyal to our proprietors
I wish it to be understood that the remarks I make have reference only to the part of the Kildonan Strath which is the subject of my commission
In the printed statement which was provided at the time the  acres were offered to let an estimate of the old land was given to those who chose to be offerers for the different farms
The quantity of acres taken up as old land of that  acres was ascertained by means of a most careful man who was in my service
I told him to take the Ordnance plan and ascertain the quantity of old arable land and to have that checked by personally going over the ground
I think the statement which we give in our printed advertisement of the quantity of land is correct
I think we may assume it as correct and the amount is  acres within the area of  acres
In regard to the rest of the two parishes to which reference was made I am under the impression from a discussion which took place on this subject some time ago with the Dukes agents that the  acres at Kinbrace represent more old land in proportion to pasture than the other part
The whole of Kinbrace is therefore included in the parish of Kildonan
I give you my reason for answering that in the affirmative
I have been advocating very strongly the policy of making the old arable ground the centres for the homesteads of small farms and I have been met with this argument on the part of the Dukes other agents that this portion of the property which is under my control has a much greater quantity of old arable land than the rest of Sutherland
My impression has been that there is as much old arable ground in Sutherland as would make very good centres for an excellent pastoral farming system of small farms
My impression is that it represents the whole because in my instructions to my surveyor who went over the ground I told him to take all the ground that had been under the plough without respect to whether it was green ground or whether it had gone back to heather
I wanted him to include the land that had gone back to heather along with the green ground
I think there is not any difficulty in ascertaining the quantity of land that has been under cultivation
I would not like to commit myself to say that these  acres include all the land because of my own personal knowledge I could not state so
This is only the result of the instruction I have given to my surveyor to take it from the Ordnance plan and to go over the ground but I would be quite correct in asserting that  or  acres would exceed anything that had ever been under cultivation within that area
From my own personal inspection having been over the whole of these  acres a hundred times and I know all the green ground that is upon it
I have not measured it but I am prepared to swear that the amount of ground upon that farm which had originally been under cultivation would not exceed  or  acres
Quite possible and we had a very interesting instance of that
We reclaimed a piece of land that had been cultivated by the Picts on which there were  inches of moss covering it but I am prepared to say that my remarks have reference to all the land that was under cultivation within  years
I am certain not on this farm
I will very much have to go over the whole circumstances in connection with the formation of the association
The people of Helmsdale previously had a grazing they called Griamacharry and after the present commissioner came to Sutherland this grazing was withdrawn from the people without any consultation and I think very unjustly and unfairly withdrawn from them
I do not think there was any injury intended
I think it must have been entirely an oversight on the part of the commissioner who was not acquainted with the circumstances of the grazing but nevertheless it was a great hardship to the people at the time and an agitation was got up here to have the matter represented to his Grace
The result of that was that the Duke put the matter into my hands with fall power to do anything I liked in doing justice to the people for that grazing which was taken from them
I came to Helmsdale and met a few of the leading people in connection with the original grazing and had a very satisfactory meeting with them
I told them I was commissioned by the Duke to do whatever I thought was just between the Duke and them without consultation with his Grace and that I was prepared to put this farm of Suisgill at their disposal
The result of that meeting with these few people was that subsequently they called a meeting of the whole crofters in the district
That was a meeting which I attended and I estimate the attendance at  people
It was an open meeting and everything in connection with my proposal was placed before them with the result that there was not a dissentient voice in connection with the proposals
I say it to the credit of the people of Helmsdale that I never in connection with any business I ever undertook had more satisfaction
They met me in a spirit which was highly creditable to them
In a manly spirit
It showed that the people of Helmsdale were people who could be developed to a much more satisfactory condition of things than existed at present by being met in the right spirit
The result was that ultimately we formed our association
I wrote the articles for the association
I discussed with them what would be the machinery for the working of the association which would be most acceptable to them and after that I wrote out the articles of association in order that they might be successful in the working of it
My impression is that in  connection with all these club farms and farms of that sort a great mistake has hitherto been made in so far as the representatives of the proprietor have always kept a firm hold on the management
They have not thrown it on the people and these associations have not met with that success which I think is in the future for the Helmsdale association
The principle which we adopted was simply to grant the association a lease  the as we would to any other tenant and on the same conditions and from what I can learn of the management up till now it has been highly satisfactory and promises not only to meet the wants for which it was formed in the way of giving temporary relief but it is likely to prove a great success financially
They have articles of association similar to a joint stock company which provide for all their meetings for committees for every contingency that could happen in connection with the management of an association or company
As regards the duty of the working committee each represents a district and there are as many districts as there are members of committee
Each member of committee brings at a certain date in the year a list of the quantity of stock in his district which is to be put on the grazing
After that is all arranged the committee of management see what they can calculate upon from the people in the way of stock
This year after the lists were all brought in it was found the requirements of the whole of the crofters who were members of the association were not equal to half the capacity of the grazing
This necessitated the committee of management borrowing capital for the purpose of stocking
The crofters are all enrolled as members of the association and their names are all in the articles
Then the committee of management appoint two or three of their number as the managing members of committee
These managing members of committee take in stock from the whole members of the association at a certain rate which they fix
This done the members of committee proceed to purchase stock for the purpose of making up the deficiency in the stock and the whole thing is managed simply on the principle of a joint stock company the members of the association who are crofters having the first right to send stock to the grazing at certain fixed prices
It is intended I believe by the present members of committee that there should be no division of profits until the association is in possession of as much capital as would in the event of the crofters not sending sufficient stock enable the committee to stock the farm without borrowing capital
They intend to accumulate the profits till they have a sinking fund which would meet any emergency in connection with the successful management of the holding
Their first duty will be to pay the debt
It would have been very much more serviceable to the people of Helmsdale and the surrounding neighbourhood if the grazing had been lying adjacent to their holdings but the position of this grazing is very much more accessible than the grazing they had previously
It is about half the distance
In regard to the arable crofts that is to say crofts that have no outrun having carried out a series of experiments with the new land my experience is that they would result in complete failure but if you give them a small piece of arable land with a large outrun I am satisfied there is no way in which the grazing of Sutherland could be more economically managed not only for his Grace but for the nation as that of having a man that is interested in the stock living in the centre of it and managing bis own business
If that policy was adopted I would recommend that not only small crofts but a gradation of crofts should be established
I would commence with a croft of perhaps about forty acres of arable land with not less than  acres of pasture
That would mean a rental if you take the pasture at d per acre of  for pasture and if you take the arable land at s per acre it would mean  for arable
That would be the rental
That would be the smallest holding I could recommend to any family and if assistance could be given to a great many of the present crofters in this country to start at that point I am quite certain that before they finished a nineteen years lease they would be able to take a much larger holding
Something like a  rental
Of course I do not mean to say a man would not be much better with a place half that size than he is in his present circumstances but I would like if possible to see the next step from the common grazing which we have laid out at Suisgill
That I reckon the first step to the assistance of the small crofter and the next step I would like to see would be a farm of a rent of  and rather than give a family a less holding than that if I was a proprietor I would assist them with the capital
Well I reckon if there were facilities given for them mortgaging their stock and getting assistance it would be about as safe a business as any one could start and I am satisfied if the tenants are selected for their character and ability to work a holding the capital could be supplied to them and land supplied to them without much risk
I would not be disposed to recommend a much smaller holding
Of course if you had a gradation of holdings once established no doubt a man with half that size of holding who could be employed during part of the year by the larger holders would be quite as successful as far as his holding went but I do not believe in any industry which does not admit of the party who takes part in it employing his whole time at work
I do not believe in intermittent labour
I believe in people who are expected to succeed being employed the whole year round
Certainly I would be disposed to do that as a stepping stone to something better
It is composed of crofters from various townships
There are eight townships
We have only had a very short trial of it
The association has not been in operation for more than six months
Perfectly representative of the different townships
The principle of regulating the rights between various townships is very simple
Each member of each township has an equal right whatever size his present holding is and the claims of the grazing are individually equal
In the event of a township having very few cattle to send to the grazing another township or other townships would be allowed to fill up the blank but when the state of business comes to that point where the demands for grazing are more than the capacity of the grazing the committee of management will have to regulate according to the townships and there is proper provision made for that in the articles of association
They have a right to send cattle sheep and horses
At the present time there are no sheep belonging to the individual crofters on the grazing
The fact that a new arrangement was made in Helmsdale in regard to the sheep two or three years ago deprived the people of their sheep and in that way just at the present time they had not any sheep to send
There is a large quantity of sheep on the grazing but these have been bought by the committee of management and put on as belonging not to individual members of the association but to the association itself
Under one mark
I presume the committee of management would naturally decide that each mans sheep sent to the grazing for each summer would be marked with his own mark
He shares in the profits of the sheep that are bought simply through the fact that he is a member of the association
He would not share individually but indirectly through the association
The profits of the sheep that are put on by the committee of management would become the property of the association and as members of the association they would participate ultimately in those profits but not otherwise
I think I can state that very great consideration has been given to the drawing up of the articles of association to afford complete machinery to meet every contingency that might arise in connection with the successful working of the grazing
I do not
The law of Scotland does not permit of the mortgaging of movable property which extends naturally to farming stock
In regard to the hill stock I draw a decided difference between ordinary farming stock and hill stock
Hill stock as a rule belongs to the grazing and cannot be removed from it
Proprietors usually hand over the stock to the tenant and bind him to hand over that stock back agaiu and in that way a very nice distinction could be drawn I think between movable property of that sort and other movable property
I myself do not believe it would be for the advantage of this country that we should promote any alteration in the law in regard to the mortgaging of movable property generally but I think for the purpose of giving relief to the crofters if for no other purpose it would be worth while to promote a change in the law to this extent that the crofter might be placed on the same platform very much as those men who have stocked the grazings of the colonies of America with such beneficial results
There are a great many of the crofters about this neighbourhood I know who would become excellent pastoral farmers if they could get the stock
It would be done by the mortgaging of the stock upon that farm
I simply point out a way in which hill stock is regarded by the various proprietors in Scotland in relation to ordinary stock on a farm and I say the distinction which could be drawn there would be one of the arguments I would use in making an exception of hill stock in asking for a change in the law
It is done every day
At the present time we find a large quantity of Scotch capital is going to America in bonds over movable propertyin fact bonds over stockand we know for certain that a large quantity of the stock which is grazing the lands in the colonies is represented by money advanced by the bankers in the colonies and I do not see why if you gave the bankers in this country a right over the stock on the various farms they should not lend money with as much security as over stock in the colonies
There is
It cannot be done
You cannot mortgage movable property by the law of Scotland
I am not aware of a single instance of any one having a security on stock for borrowed money and I am quite aware there could be no such security
No because he knows the law would not protect him
I do
I can only speak for myself and I would lend money to crofters of good character if I had a mortgage over the stock
I would have it separate from any other holdings
I do think he would manage it much more efficiently
One instead of many
That is one of my reasons
I am
It does
I would
Possibly
Yes that is exactly how I would put it
A real security
The shares are equal
It is an element in the constitution of the association and the object of doing that was in order that the small people who were most in need of help should have a right equal to those who were best off
I was present
I think I explained before that a public meeting was held where I read and described everything not only in connection with the articles of association but with the nature of the lease which was intended to be entered into on behalf of the association
I had the articles of association printed and every member of the association has a copy of these articles at this moment
I am very happy to hand in a copy now
I may say I have no authority from the Duke of Sutherland to come here and make any statement whatever beyond the instruction that I would have the same liberty at this meeting as I have had in connection with my commission since I came to Sutherland and it was simply a white card
I had power to divide those  acres in any way I thought proper for the good of the Duke and his people and I have carried out my commission entirely in that spirit
I have not consulted the Duke but I think I am safe in saying that in those suggestions I have made to you and those changes I have made in Kildonan and in everything I have done I have anticipated the spirit of the Duke but as to having authority to make that statement I have no such thing
I feel quite certain from the intercourse I have had with the Duke of Sutherland that his disposition towards his people is that they should march forward in improving their condition and that if they do not do so it is not from any want of a desire on his part not only to give them every facility but to expend large sums of money in assisting them to do it
I heard a reference made today to the conditions imposed on the Sutherland property in connection with the letting of land as being antiquated I wish to state that I had perfect liberty from the Duke to write such a lease in respect of the farms I am letting as I thought proper and to see and examine all the more recent modern provisions which have been applied to many properties in Scotland
In the lease which I have drawn and the conditions I have written I have imported into them everything which the occupation of land in modern times has suggested
I shall send in a copy of the lease to the Commissioners
I have had considerable experience of people in Great Britain and also abroad
I have managed large properties in Spain and have had some experience in America and other nations
Judging from the Sutherland workpeople who came to the reclamations they are not good workpeople but from what I have seen of their industry and their habits otherwise I can speak of them as of the highest character
My relations with them in connection with this grazing association which have been very intimate have been of the most agreeable kind and I am quite satisfied there is no difficulty in getting them to do anything that is reasonable
They want more land and they want to be assisted with more capital in order to stock it
I am quite with the people as to giving them more land
I am quite satisfied the Duke of Sutherland cannot do a better thing for himself and for the nation thau to give the people more land and develop to a great extent the county of Sutherland with the Sutherland people
It was in the upper partin the furthest away part of the farm of Kinbracea place near Griamacharry and the place at Griamacharry will be more than double the distance that Suisgill is from Helmsdale
Suisgill is perhaps nine or ten miles and Griamacharry will be at least twentythree
All the cattle stock come back to the crofts where the summer resources have been husbanded for their keep during the winter
A portion of the sheep of course will remain on the Suisgill grazings
Not for hoggs because there is not much green ground upon it but it is quite equal to wintering any class of sheep barring hoggs
I think the intention of the association is not to keep hoggs on the grazing
I think their intention is as to any extra stock that is required to buy hoggs in spring time
The association provides a herd
I have not a list of the prices
It is very like the prices they originally paid when they had the grazing at Griamacharry horses s d cattle s d stirks s cows on town grazing s
These are the prices they originally paid at Griamacharry
Cows on the low town grazing on the green ground
There is no price of sheep here
It might be very interesting for you to know what was the result of the Griamacharry grazing
The gross revenue during the last three years was about  and the expense of management  s and that is a holding that would be worth over 
I presume that is so
I dont think it makes much difference
The only difficulty that would be raised and it would be raised on the part of the proprietor would be simply this that we would have no security for our rent but if I was a proprietor in the Highlands I would be very sorry to allow that question to interfere with the improvement and the development of my people
I think not
I think a working tenant upon a grazing farm would be able to pay  per cent for his capital while a tenant who did not reside on his farm and did not manage it would not be able to go on even without paying any interest
I think not but I would not recommend anything of the sort
I do not think any tenant would ask his stock to be mortgaged for the amount of its value
I think if he was known to be a good manager he would be capable of mortgaging it to threefourths of its value and that would be a sufficient margin where the mans character was good
It is not I believe
I think the law could be so made that whether it was a regular stock or whether it was a stock of a particular class of sheep a registration in the neighbourhood where the stock is or the county where the stock is would be quite sufficient to cover the whole stock and to allow the ordinary movement to take place as in the case of a regular stock
That is to say it would not affect the mortgage suppose the man took away his draft stock and brought in his young stock
The mortgage would just transfer itself without any formalities to the stock that came in
I think the question would he answered in this way that it would be a matter for the party who made the mortgage to stipulate the conditions under which he was to move stock
In as far as it is tenants here and proprietors there
If you make the law so as to allow me to arrange a mortgage with the tenant for his stock my mortgage with him would stipulate all the conditions in connection with the movement of the stock and I would have added to an ordinary mortgage au agreement on the subject of the management of his stock which would be perfectly legal suppose you made the law to allow the mortgage in the first instance but at the present time I am not in a position to carry out any agreement with regard to the mortgage of the stock in as far as it is against the law to make a mortgage of the stock at all
I think it would
If you were justified in doing that it would be taken advantage of in many cases in connection with people on the verge of bankruptcy
They would give a preference to particular creditors through that channel
I dont think such a thing could be done
I have been settled all my life here
Yes
My father was a fishcurer for fifty years
General merchant and commission agent
No except that I buy herrings from the curers
Yes and general goods
Twentythree years
I find quite the contrary
To a large extent they do
They are gradually falling off
That is my experience
I would say it is rather a progressive decline but of course it is made worse by the failure of the fishings as I was going to show I have got a written statement
I may say that when I consented to become a delegate I led my friends to understand that except when it was absolutely necessary to refer to the past to make my narrative complete I would confine myself to matters that came under my own observation and besides the condition of the crofters I would take this opportunity of directing the attention of the Commissioners to the condition and prospects of Helmsdale harbour a condition which we all feel and deeply deplore
 I shall first briefly and with a due regard to your valuable time make some remarks on the condition of the crofters in this and the adjoining parish and from my lengthened experience among them as a trader it may be granted that I ought to know something about them
In doing this it will be necessary for me to refer to the past so as to understand how the present crofters came to be in the condition they now are
The present crofters are almost eutirely the descendants of the evicted population of the Kildonan Strath
At that period Helmsdale could scarcely be said to have an existence and the hill sides we now see so thickly populated were simply moorland and from what we know of it now a most unlikely place to settle so large a number of crofters
Those people who lived in the Strath before those evictions took place have often told me that notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary those people were then in a very prosperous and contented condition
Every one knows that at that time agriculture was in a very primitive condition and the crops then could not be compared with what could be got now but this was true not alone of Kildonan but also of the whole north of Scotland and had the inhabitants of Kildonan been allowed to remain there until this day I for one believe that men who have been so long and so truly renowned for bravery in the battlefield would not have failed to keep pace with the agricultural progress of the age and instead of this Strath being the wilderness it now may be said to be it would be one vast agricultural garden peopled by a strong hardy contented and loyal people loyal alike to their queen and country and to the noble proprietor under whom they now live and who instead of having to expend thousands of pounds in land reclamation as he has done would have come into possession of this estate with all the available land reclaimed by the strong and willing hands of a population of which he would justly be proud and the history of the Sutherland clearances would never have had to be written
I am not going to occupy your time by going into the causes that led to the removal of those people nor the manner in which that removal was carried out suffice it to say that it has become a matter of history that it was done and I shall only say it was in my mind a grand mistake but a mistake which can be rectified
I must just give one reason set forth for the removal of those people from Kildonan to the sea coast by the then leader of the movement and that was that those people  might become fishermen a very laudable excuse but to this day they have not become fishermen and although this has been said over and over again it is time once and for all to dispel this idea because there are not in this and the adjoining parishes a half dozen of fishermen who are crofters
Then as to the present condition of the crofters the fact of their being settled upon patches of but indifferent ground of from two to three acres is almost saying enough
It must be evident to any one that it is an utter impossibility for crofters with families to do more than eke out a bare subsistence on such crofts
No doubt when they came into possession of those crofts the rents were merely nominal but that is not the case now
I consider they are paying in some cases too high a rent but this is not the chief complaint it is that they have too little landso little in fact that the constant cropping has made much of it really valueless and it is I those with whom the crofters have commercial dealings who know how straitened they are in their circumstances and how hard it is for them to live and when the herring fishing fails as it has done for some years past then they are much worse off because while the fishing is prosperous they obtain not only employment for themselves but also for their families and when the fishing is a failure no such employment is to be got
Now it will be asked how is this state of matters to be remedied
I can only see one way and that is by giving the people more land
There is plenty of land to be had and if the crofters were as it were thinned in their present holdings by giving holdings of say ten to twenty acres to those people most likely able to take them and their crofts given to those that remained and so enlarging their holdings in this manner and that along with those holdings suitable hill pasture be also given on fair and equitable terms then and not till then can those people be in any manner comfortable
Then as to the herring fishing which is of such vast importance to the county and to this place in particular I may just mention as an instance of this importance that one fishcurer on a medium scale gives more employment to the people in one season that one dozen of the largest sheep farmers in the county
I have mentioned that the fishing has failed for some years past and I am going to show what has in my opinion largely contributed to this failure and that is the want of a good harbour
Helmsdale harbour was erected many years ago and proved a very great benefit to the district
It will be granted that engineering like many other things was not then as perfect as it is now and at the best Helmsdale harbour could never have been called either a good or safe harbour
It is a tidal harbour that is to say at low water no boat or vessel can either enter or leave it and what is worse still the river runs through it thus making the entrance liable to be silted by the frequent floods in the river banks of sand also get accumulated inside the harbour which is both dangerous and obstructive to vessels
Yet notwithstanding this for years it suited fairly well as a fishing harbour until the period some ten or twelve years ago came round when it was found to make a successful fishing fishermen had to go great distances at sea and to enable them to do that with safety they had to get larger and stronger boats so much so that while in  this harbour had  boats fishing out of it it will now be overcrowded with  And yet the boats that still come here to fish are by no means of the largest class for owing to what I said about the bar those could not fish here at all there being not sufficient water for them because if they did manage to get in at high water with a cargo of fish by the time they discharged their fish the tide would be gone and so a whole nights fishing would be lost Since last December the bar on this harbour has been almost closed and the consequence was that many  tons of fish were landed at Buckie that would have been landed here but for the state of the harbour thus entailing great loss on the curers and depriving the railway company of a very large amount of traffic all the fish caught in winter being sent by rail
The bar is still I am sorry to say in the same condition
Now a great many people are owners of property in Helmsdale particularly of excellent curingyards than which there are not better anywhere
His Grace also owns several of those yards and if the harbour is not improved so that the most modern method of herring fishery can be carried on here as well as other places and if at the same time an effort is not made to improve the condition of the crofter population then Helmsdale must go down and property become of little or no value thus entailing great loss to both the proprietor and the feuars whose interests at least in this respect are identical
In  I had thehonour of laying a scheme of harbour improvements before the Duke a copy of which I now hand to you
I accompanied the scheme by a sketch of the harbour lately made at Buckie and which was built entirely at the proprietors expense it is a deep water harbour that is boats can enter and leave it at any state of the tide yet Buckie never had the one half of the traffic that was usually here
I am sorry to say nothing came of my scheme and although nature has made Helmsdale a very suitable place for a deep water harbour as not only could it be done cheaply but also efficiently I hear of no steps being taken in that direction
I conclude those remarks with the fervent hope that the labours of your Commission may be the means of giving lasting benefits to the crofter population of Scotland and that his Grace will yet and soon see fit to erect such a harbour here as will not only prove a safe haven to many a stormtossed mariner but that it be the means of bringing a return of prosperity to Helmsdale besides being a lasting memorial of the goodness of his Grace the Duke and of the House of Sutherland
Most decidedly
No I dont mean that I dont call these fishermen
I mean those who have shares in boats and nets
No there are not a great number
They have greatly decreased
Yes
No it has not except the local authoritythe Parochial Board
Nothing
There is not
No because the present harbour belongs solely to the Duke of Sutherland it was built entirely by the late Earl of Sutherland
Not that we are aware of
Entirely
I cannot say I do
Well they are scarcely able to sell any
They sell some cattle and of course the prices have gone considerably up I understand
None at all
I do
Exactly
They would have been increasing if I had allowed them
I am not
I believe I could not make  more in the year
Yes
They were
For one thing they have not the same crofts as they had then
The land has been getting gradually worse has been falling offand they had several bad years and there has been a falling off in the fishing
In  was the first great failure of the fishing
Instead of  crans as the average they had only   which was virtually a failure
No what I maintain is that they should have something that would render them entirely independent of the fishing because it is not a right thing to have people entirely dependent upon such a precarious occupation as the fishing
Well they have never been in a good condition since I remember
Undoubtedly
Undoubtedly that is one of the great causes of it
There is no doubt many of them have friends in the south who would give temporary assistance till they could repay it again
Yes
I am not capable of answering that question because I am not an agriculturist but I should say the matter of  might do it fairly well with what they would do themselves
Yes
Just because owing to the precarious nature of the fishing it is a very bad thing for people to depend upon it in any way
But the people are not fishing
They are dependent upon that for employment when not working at their crofts
I would wish them to be independent of going to the fishing at all
I ask it for the feuars of Helmsdale who hold thousands of pounds worth of property
What will become of that property if there is nothing done for the harbour
Not of the crofters
Of course there are fishermen who are not crofters
They ought to be able to support themselves without being dependent on labour otherwise
I think about
I think there are over  houses
In some cases they have ninetynine years and I know some of them have got perpetual leases
The terms are very moderate indeed
Yes
They are more or less dependent upon it
There are many who are coopers and make barrels and there is a class of fishermen who are fishermen alone they are living at a place called Port Gower
There are eight crews of them
I do
Perfectly that is my opinion
The one class would help the other
That is my idea
Decidedly
Yes we have a sanitary committee
It is looked very well after
The Duke has put some water into the place with pumps
When they were making the railway water was brought down to feed the engines and he was good enough to bring it into the place at his own expense entirely
Yes from the hills
Yes
Yes
I had not a personal interview but I had correspondence
Yes
Yes but not for any lengthened period
I did
A deep water basin
I could not explain it unless you could come and see the ground
I mean an additional deep water harbour outside entirely of the present harbour
Part of it about thirtyfive or forty years ago and the other part sixty or seventy years ago
I am told by a party here who says he knows that there was nothing of the sort
No nothing of the kind at the time
No I am not aware that they were supplied with anything
It took four or five years I suppose before they got it finished
 I understand was the sum
Yes but it has always been giving a fairly good revenue
There has been a sort of attempt by means of groins but it never answered the purpose
I should say it would be rather dangerous to take a vessel in that drew more than  feet of water
Yes
Yes
Sutherland
Yes
Yes my immediate forefathers
I have been in the south
In Edinburgh
I have been here for ten years
Previous to ten years ago I was in Edinburgh
Yes
Yes
Yes
I have a statement to read
Yes I have been appointed for that side of the estate
They have been telling me the grievances and I have written them down
They approved of it
They are here to prove it
 Roster the district which I have been asked to represent at this meeting is on the westermost boundary of the Clyth estate
As Britain is surrounded by the ocean so Roster is completely encompassed with heathercovered moor and thus may truly be called an  oasis in the desert
Being isolated in this way it has a peculiar history of its own
This I venture to submit to Her Majestys Commissioners as worthy of their attention  in illustrating the evils of the land system under which we crofters live
I wish to trace the effects of that system in Roster during the present century
At its beginning Roster had three tenants
I have been able to find out the exact rent of only one of these that was   as the other two lots were about the same size and had the same privileges each would pay about the same rent that would make  in all
Let us say  to make sure work
Now I wish to point out the privileges this rental brought to the three tenantsnot only had they a right to the arable patches round their houses but to all the moorland within a radius of about two miles from the centre of the township over all this their sheep cattle and horses roamed by right after their own free willThe average number of these on each lot was about three horses five cows ten small cattle and from thirty to forty sheep
This state of matters was first disturbed about the year  or  Dr Henderson the tacksman of these days went to Tongue in Sutherlandshire and the adjoining district induced a number of the crofters there to come to Clyth and settle down as fishermen
Several families had lots assigned to them in Roster
They settled down on unfilled land and although the rent in most cases was only nominal they had to build for themselves and reclaim the land before they could sow anything
When in  evictions took place in Strathnaver more families from that quarter came and settled down in Roster
In  still larger accessions came from Kildonan and a readjustment of the holdings had to be made the moorland pasture being still the common right of all
Dr Henderson was tacksman still and it is worthy of notice how he treated the people
He was proprietor fishcurer and merchant
One account was kept for all dealings which was of course on the truck system and the people knew only at the end of four years how matters stood with them
From this time  on till  as the people were reclaiming the land and bettering their houses the rents gradually rose
There was indeed a promise of melioration for the houses built but as the tacksman in the end failed this was never fulfilled
Matters however went on quietly in Roster till  a considerable amount of moorland was now reclaimed and formed an unbroken tract of arable land of such dimensions as would make one nice large farm
Some time about  the tenants got word that they were to be cleared off the estate and the reason assigned was that they were a lazy neerdoweel lot
Mr Home was now factor but instead of approaching him the tenants sent two of their number John MIntosh and William MKenzie to Thurso Castle to Sir George Sinclair to ask why they were to be turned off
He said he was told they were of no use on the estate and of as little to the nation as their young men never left home
These two delegates however pointed out that not only did the Roster people greatly improve their holdings and prosecute the fishing but at that time there were sixteen men belonging to it in the army and navy and mercantile service
Sir George said  If I get that verified you are all secure in your district and so the tenants went to their work again in peace and a wouldbe big farmer was disappointed
We are glad to observe that proprietors now see the wisdom of disappointing more embryo big farmers
The next stage in this townships history is the granting of leases by Sir Tollemache Sinclair and this brings me to quote figures to show how the land system wrought
In  and for two years after leases were given to the tenants for fourteen years
They were got on conditions that new houses should be built and an increase of rent paid both at the beginning and middle of the lease
When the tenant agreed to slate his house the proprietor helped in money and material to the extent of   in case of some thatched houses assistance was given to the extent of  making a total sum of  expended by him
Some ditches were also put in as marches to the extent of  to  in all  Now for a comparison of Roster in  and in   Rental in    rental in   increase  If this increase were capitalised at twenty years purchase it would amount to  Deduct from this  the sum expended by the proprietor in improvements and you have  the exact amount put into the landlords pockets by the lazy tenants of Roster and by the inherent value of their soil reclaimed from heath and peatmoss
This is but half the story as concerns Roster and the best or rather worst half is to be told
The rental of Roster in this year of grace is fully  increase since   this capitalized at twenty years purchase is  Deduct from this value of meliorations  other improvements  in all  for improvements made by the proprietor again put into the proprietors pockets by this peat begirt region
And what are our privileges in return
There is no longer any moorland outside the crofts for our diminished flocks to roam over
Instead of three horses five cows and ten small cattle and thirty or forty sheep running over a wide extent of pasture the crofters horse and cow and two small beasts are now as a neighbour pithily put it to me yesterday anchored by tether on a few square yards of lea and stubble land
In eightythree years Rosters rent has risen from  to  the increase ever rising faster and faster
This shows that our fathers and we have toiled hard
We have made the place what it is and so we love it as our home
Our clinging to it has cost us dearly no less than  to the capital value of the place worth only  in the year  There is no end of waste land encircling Roster much of it waiting to be reclaimed
We are tired of reclaiming on such conditions however we are gratified for the Land Act passed by the Government this year but we hope this Commission will do something to help the tenants at least to share with the proprietor the result of their own labour in reclaiming the soil
I did
Yes
It is turned into sheep runs
Yes
Yes the greatest part
About  acres I think have been cultivated
About that
Yes
No not as common pasture
There is a small strip of a few acres in one case that belongs to nobody but it is not of much service as pasture
No
There are some bits
Yes it would add to the area but not to the value
There is a plot of four or five acres of rough ground in each croft at present
Threetwo complete ones and part of one
The one is to the east side I did not look at the rental as it lay a bit from the district but I think it is something like 
One of them is wholly a sheep farm and the part of the one that was taken out of that pasture is wholly a sheep farm
They are all almost wholly sheep farms
No
Some of them live by the crofts and there are others abroad assisting them to pay the rent and live and a few go to the fishing
Mr Adam Sharp
Yes
Yes altogether
Sinclair held it longer but it has been at a faster rate since the present proprietor came
None but what I have mentioned
He is liable to pay meliorations and he expended about 
Yes
All over the parish
When I am at home
Since ten or twelve years ago
Yes
There have been any amount of schools to build
That is the principal thing
Yes
They increased and have diminished again
A good deal because there was seldom such a thing happening as so many buildings going on
There are none being built just now
We get no security for meliorations
They are all stone and clay they are not built with much lime
Yes
It will last one hundred years
Excellent stone the weather has no effect upon it
No
They are not like the stones in the south of the country
The greater part from year to year
There are very few leases
There were leases given at one period
Every one had leases
When the former proprietor sold the estate he had leases but since then very few have had leases
They think their position is so bad that they dont care for going into a contract of lease under the present system
Both and that their holdings after all that they have made are too dear
Too much rent and they dont get compensation
About eighty I think
The greater number
Yes so it turned out
Some were induced to go as the factor wished to get the fishing started
There are several waiting and ready to do what they can with their work if they would get security for what they put out in money at the end of their leases and some of them have bad houses too
Yes
I think so
I am not minutely acquainted with it
I dont know
Yes
Yes
The tenant has another farm at this moment in Rossshire
Yes
No our proprietor is not strict on us in that respect
We are on very good terms so far as we can manage
Yes and then if we got security and the like of that there are some patches which the greater part of us could cultivate and so improve our position
Yes great numbers go
They go to all parts
Those who dont go abroad go away to the fishing in the summer season and wherever they can get work
Yes a great many
No I could not say there is nothing special
Yes there is a good deal that might be reclaimed
If they got the land on the same footing on which they get it there it would be better
Yes that is my opinion
Yes by the tenantry on the Clyth estate
I have been elected to read a statement from the tenantry on the Clyth estate
Yes
No I have been in three places I was born and brought up on a croft
My father had a croft and then we shifted when that relotting took place which is spoken of in this statement
We had to leave the country altogether and then we settled in a place on the north side of where I am just now
At home
In my own place I have never been anywhere else
I have been a fisherman from fourteen years of age
I am the tenant
No he died seven years ago
The arable ground when I took possession of it was something like  acres I improved it and have put out  perhaps or  on it since I took a lease of it
Yes
Nineteen years
I took a transfer from another
I am not certain how many years have elapsedperhaps eleven
Yes
No not on account of existing improvements
I gave  of meliorations
For the wood of the house
Something about between  and 
No taking my own labour into account more than ordinary farm work
I have trenched a good deal of what I ploughed and taken out rocks and stones and drained it and removed old houses and put the land together removed dykes and put it in shape
Yes some on the office houses
At the end of my lease I only got  taken off for meliorations
Yes
Nothing and I have asked for help but I have been denied it on the plea that it was for my own benefit
 but there is a room on the place which makes it 
I have added to it since I came but when I came there were eleven acres
There is some heath pasture I cannot say how many acres but it is very worthless so far as it goes
Nothing like twenty acres
It faces the sea
I never had anything on it but two sheep what is above the road the cows sometimes go on
If it were enclosed it might keep four or six sheep
No the common pasture was all taken off the tenants in  what is in the statement is much too low
It says there are about  acres but there must have been  or between  and  taken off the tenants
I think there are a few acres of common pasture in Roster on the west end of the estate
No reduction but something like  per cent was laid on the rents
All the young stock such as sheep that went to that common hill they had to cut short because then their holdings were merged and they did not go over their lots
They had to remain within their lots in those crofts
They had no hill pasture whatever except what I have mentioned
Yes they had to do away with all their sheep
The other cattle became unsuitable because it was what we call Highland cattle they kept on the hill but they had to change and keep the cattle on the lots
Yes much fewer
Not of the same kind
The one is Highland and the other is cross
Yes we have to buy it in for them
I keep one horse three cows and three calves and two sheep and at Martinmas I have often to sell off some of the calves just as this season I will have to sell off some of the calves
Since I have added to it I think there should be something like six or five and a half acres under grain
A regular rotation a fifth year rotation
We are bound to the rules of good husbandryeither fifth or sixth
I thresh it in our own barns and I mill it
Yes
We consume the grain in our own family and it is very little I can afford but I rather buy in more than I sell it
Yes
Yes
In a very good season it may do the family
The family is not very old
The oldest is only nine years
No some seasons they are very poor
The potatoes in general are a very poor crop on our side of the coast
They dont agree well with the salt water spray that is dashed up
Just by taking it out of the sea
I have been now on my third croft and I wrought a great deal on the second one I was in but I never could see yet that the land benefited me
If I can take the rent out of the sea I can stay then in the winter season comfortably but if I did not get it out of the sea it was a pinch with me all the seasonit impoverished me all the season
Yes
Practically I do
Six and perhaps a boy
Yes
The boat was not advanced to me by a fishcurer
I just began by entering along with my father and by keeping my head above water as we sayby being very carefulI have managed to do so  though sometimes pretty hard put to it
Yes
Much higher considering the custom of the country
I could not be sure
Along the coast there may be those who may be paying not so much as we do though very high rents but in the county their rents are much lower
They dont pay the half
I possessed that at first but I have added to it
I think I have something like five added
About fifteen I think but I cannot be sure
Yes
In the other parts of the country there is not the same sort of soil that we have
For one thing our elevation is very high
Most of the land of Clyth is about  feet above the level of the sea and some as high as  and there is no real subsoil in it
All the patches of ground that are good with us those who came before us carted the surface that is within a distance of a mile from it and have laid it upon those patches the same way as they cultivate on the west coast at the present time and there was no regular rotation then
The regular rotation began when the lots were cut up
About the same except the two largest farms the Mains of Clyth farm and the farm of Bruan Lodge
The one has only been raised  per cent and Bruan Lodge something like  per cent
Just that I would make something to support my family
Yes of course I just ran the chance
There could be no view but for profitto make something by it
No I may have heard a rumour but I have no authority for it
It varies very much according to the season because in a season like thisin a late seasonor when the harvest blast comes on it when once the corn whitens beneath the ear it fills no more but sometimes it is about  lbs or  lbs or  lbs or  lbs and as low as  lbs in  or  lbs or  lbs
I cannot exactly tell that
I would say something like fifteen or twenty bolls of meal
Well in a poor year we will not make twelve but if it is an ordinarily good year we get that off it
If we get that we cannot allow anything to a horse or anything of that kind
We must keep it all for the winter and buy in for the horse
Something like eleven years
A brotherinlaw of mine took it the season before that but he never entered it
He had the quarry of Clyth rented from the present proprietor
I was then living with my brother in a croft on the north side of the present one and we came there and broke in out of the heather something like twenty acres and built a steading to the amount of perhaps fully more than twenty roods of mason work and the whole would cost say not less than between  and  between the money and the labour we put out on that place
Because my brotherinlaw did not go into it for some reason that I cannot tell and because  wanted to be alongside my father and mother as they were growing up in years and because it was along the coast side and none being in possession of the place except my brotherinlaw I took the place as a transfer from my brotherinlaw
I did but I knew there was no help if I wanted the land I had to give it
It was for that very reasonjust because I could get no other holding on the estate near the one I was into
Yes
More than the average rent of course because there is land on the Clyth property that may be cheaper but it is not worth ploughing or cultivating
In some spots that are good it is just the surface carted from other lands
There is much of it where you have to take the surface and put it on the rocks the same as ifyou were drying earth on a kiln
Yes
The people became poor in circumstances so that they could not put properly to sea
If they go to sea they have to go as hired hands
The increase of their rents was one thing that led to their poverty just the same as if a hair had been coming out of the head always year by year paying heavy rentsand another thing was the industry of the fishing
The harbours allowed to go to ruin and also the fishing itself took a change
The boats are now made much larger than they were
Yes but at that time when these people came about  or before  there must have been more than  owners of boats on this estate because no one would get any land there except some one who had a part of a boat
There were something like one hundred boats fishing in the creeks when the tacksmen Miller and Henderson had these harbours and stations
Well they were just allowed to go to ruin by not paying attention to them and they were knocked down by storms
Take the harbour of Occumster
I was fishing twenty years ago and a quay was put up then
It was no time after the proprietor Mr Sinclair had put it up and laid out a large sum of moneyit was no time till it was upon the beach
There was a time when I was in Occumster and it was put up every year
Either the proprietor or the curer
It was between the twojust temporarily but whenever a storm came there was no safety there
That is so
In that period there was only the one station they fished at in Clyth and there were few boats there
There was no fishing from the estate constantly except in Clyth
No they would not
The present system of fishing is on a pretty expensive scale
Fishing at the present time one of these boats with six men requires to expend whether they fish or not from  to 
Yes that is the case
None whatever that I can point to
Nothing that I can point to but what was allowed to go away
Perhaps on the west end I am not so well acquainted but I have been all my lifetime on the estate
There is not much fencing into it
No there have been some old dykes taken away but there was never any fencing that I can remember such as that which divided the old properties
The old ones have been all taken away and put underground in drains and the surface made plain to the satisfaction of the proprietor
Yes  The zigzag lots that marched with each other were made straight and all the old houses were removed by the tenants
Yes there has been much complaining for twelve or fourteen or fifteen years ever since they have been feeling the rent to be a pinch and it took the shape of public meetings about two years ago
Yes I attended meetings and the tenants in those meetings asked me to be chairman and being present there I did take a part for the benefit of the tenantry
I have been in the Beauly Firth repeatedly year after year
Never more than a trip for ten days at the longest
Yes a good few I know no difference
Yes and they employ their time in improving themselves j that is to say at night
Yes I addressed a meeting in Wick and in Aberdeen
Well they are competent enough to do it but they may not have tried it
Yes I think generally they are intelligent
Well I would say so so far as I have known them I hare found them trustworthy and I believe where they have had their dealings they can get credit and there can be testimony borne to their honour in the way of paying so far as they can do it
Yes
Yes I heartily concur with that
I believe it is a great degradation to the population
The very servants that are employed on these farms have not the same privileges and they lose that honour that is connected with a man who is not a servant and when they go away from service they cannot turn their hand to anything because health and strength have gone and they have nothing for it but what they had during the time they were servantsnothing but the public to support them
Yes it has because for one thing where bothies are used these are without any ruling head and they have a very prejudicial effect upon the morals of the young people
I am not acquainted with large farms so minutely as to say that
No I have not heard it stated
By going to the market and hiring those that come to the marketmen and women
Yes generally on big farms I believe they hire for twelve months
Yes I know they would stand a very short time if they had to pay the same rent
No some seasons he comes to the lodge at Bruan and stays there a short time
He has a lodge where the shooting men put up when they take the moors and he stays there when he comes north
No
No he has not enforced game very strictly upon us nothing but the common Scotch Game Law and I never heard any instance where the proprietor was strict in regard to game with us
Well the rabbits do us some evil but I have no doubt he might have prohibited us from shooting
I cannot say whether he would
I have never asked him
No particular complaint
I want the land valuedour holdings valued
We believe it is a just thing and we believe the proprietor can do that
That is the chief grievance and then those improvements which I made and laid out so heavily upon instead of being a benefit have turned out rather a ruin because another man could come and give a higher rent although he sat ouly one year
But if we had compensation such as  or and one tenant says he has laid out if such a thing were before the offerer he would not think of giving such a rent for the place
The greater part of them are
Yes attached to the estate and there have been a great many that have gone away
I am safe to say that in my memory the estate has decreased by  per cent of the population
It has decreased by  within twenty years
Yes
There are now something like  of population on the estate according to the last census
Well our young people all go away
The women go to the south and dont come back
They are in Australia New Zealand and America and of course some hang on to their parents just to keep them in their holdings
Since  I would say the holdings must have diminished
I cannot be quite correct in what I say but I think they must have diminished by something like  or
They are added to other places
I cannot be correct to a holding but I think I am correct in saying
Yes
The two largest are the Mains of Clyth and Bruan Lodge
I believe that the law should step in and break the present leases because it has brought us to the verge so that we cannot pay our debts
Well I cannot say I have improved it but I have maintained my ground
Nearly so but in our calling of the fishing I may be proprietor of a boat this season and next year it may be away
It is a precarious business because if you dont make a fishing the expense is so heavy that it goes out of your hands all at once
Yes
The greater part of the tenants have been forced into these engagements by the force of circumstances
That is why I believe the owner has power to value it and should value it if he wished to have the people there
I believe the Clyth tenants if they had the means would emigrate but I believe they would not emigrate until they would see the law changed
Yes or it may be a year or two more
Not improved but the other way every year getting worse
No increase because it was eaten up by excessive rents year after year
Upon Latheronwheel only
Eight years
I dont think Major Stocks had a factor
He had a manager who looked after the estate
Not previously
Not at present
None
I have
In the first place Mr MCulloch went on to say there was a common pasture at Braelungie taken from the tenants and he said I went and used threats along with the sheriffs officer to induce them to sign a letter that they would go out
I deny that I ever used a threat
Major Stocks expended  on a piece of land to have it reclaimed
He built a steading and wanted a tenant
We thought it would be well to have the pasture divided so that this tenant would have his own share of it
He paid  of rent
Twelve tenants in Braelungie paid  I went and asked each tenant if he was willing it should be divided and they said yes  Well I said give me a letter to that effect because my instructions from the Major were not to take it unless they were willing to give it up
I find from the map of the estate that the tenant who got the pasture has about  acres or thereby and the tenants who are round about have now actually  or  acres of pasture
I cannot speak with regard to the pasture referred to by Mr MCulloch taken from the Leodabost tenants
I was never aware that such a thing happened
Mr MCulloch said something about leases that there were no leases granted at Latheronwheel
Now there was a very good reason for that
They never asked a lease and Major Stocks never puts out a tenant and never raises the rent
I never knew him raise the rent except in one case and that was the case of a man who had a lease at a rather low rent
He improved his farm and his lease was out and he was asked if he was now prepared to give  for his farm
He had paid  s
He said  No Major I cannot give you that I have been worked hard and I will give you and therefore he got his farm at a rise of s
Mr MCulloch went on to say that the Mains farm of Latheronwheel was let at a rent of  It is quite correct but he went further and tried to show that the value had decreased
Now that is really not the case because although Dr Burn has this farm for  we were offered  for it which I am prepared to prove
With regard to game I must say there is not one rabbit now on Latheronwheel for ten there were ten years ago and Major Stocks has given Dr Burn permission under the Game Law Act to destroy the rabbits on the Mains farm although he was sitting under a lease previous to the passing of the Act
Mr MCulloch has also referred to some pasture at Achnagoul taken from the tenants and given to Dr Burn
That is not the case
Dr Burn occupies the farm just now as it was occupied by the previous tenant
I regret to say that some of the statements of Mr MCulloch got at the meeting at Latheron are false
I was told by a person present at the meeting that a man rose and said his rent was raised
Now the person who told me that told it in the office and I opened the ledger and showed him it was false
I think it wrong for people to make false statements and ask Mr MCulloch to come here and give them to the  Commissioners
That is all I have to say
It was made by Major Stocks at his own expense the land was brought under cultivation at his own expense
From the centre of the common pasture
About sixty acres arable
Exactly
Not that I am aware of but that was previous to my being made factor
Not to my knowledge
No but the tenant of that farm has no right whatever to go on the common pasture
It was separated at the time
Previously the occupier of that farm pastured the common pasture along with the tenants
No I dont admit they had a right and I dont admit they have a right now because there is nothing in their agreements about pasture at all
We let the arable farms
I quite believe the proprietor allowed them the privilege of pasturing
They were accustomed to do so
No reduction
They did
I think I have
I have not got it with me at this moment
They did
They did not
No application
There are leases
No
Nineteen years
They have not
There are very few leases indeed
It is principally the larger holders who have leases
None
Not that I am aware of
I dont think so
I never heard of anybody who ever asked it
They dont seem to want it
Major Stocks never evicts a tenant
I have never been asked for a lease
The improvements are generally made by the landlord and tenant
Major Stocks assists them if they want a house or want land broken in
He did so regularly so long as he had the home farm in charge
He sent persons to break in the land
He gives him the land free of charge and does not add any rent
As long as he sits
In building houses
There is no rule to go by
It depends entirely on the arrangement between the proprietor and the individual
I cannot because there have been no new houses built since I have been factor but I know that previous to that Major Stocks had done something in the way of building houses
He would perhaps put on the roof and supply the wood and they built the walls
Certainly
Yes
No general rule
I will be very glad to answer what I believe to be the case
It was on account of very valuable services rendered by Dr Burn to Major Stocks family
Not at all if Major Stocks cared to take advantage of it but in the meantime he does not care to do so
They have the full power under the Act to do so
I am not prepared to say anything on that point because I have not Major Stocks authority for doing so
I dont think so I have never heard it
Major Stocks has the moor in his own hands
The proprietor had it in his own hands to begin with
It was part of the commonty
Yes a good tenant
That is perhaps quite true but after the doctor took the farm he complained that it was too dear even at  That was the first rent he paid for the farm
At the time these offers were made there was a mania for land and perhaps there were higher offers put in than it was reasonable to expect but he complained it was too dear at  and Major Stocks took  off the rent two years ago
Certainly
With one exception
Well we did not admit that they had a claim to it
Well it is not let along with the arable
Major Stocks has allowed them the privilege of the pasture
Not in my time
I dont think they have anything to show that they have got it
Certainly
No he stays here a few months in the year
I am not prepared to say
I am not disposed to let them at all Major Stocks wishes to keep them
The value put upon them when Major Stocks purchased the estate was 
Yes but I am not prepared to say what they are worth now in the market
Oh no
No
It is
No no printed ones
I am quite prepared to say that
I dont think so
So far as I am aware there would be nothing objectionable
Yes
I dont know what advantage they take of it
Some of their crofts have been destroyed by rabbits but I have paid for damages done by rabbits and even this year Major Stocks has ordered me to take half the rent from a man whose property was so destroyed
There is but Major Stocks has directed me on more than one occasion to pay for it when damage was done
He does take precautions by snaring shooting and trapping but it is a most difficult matter where there are woods to get at them
They run in and it is not easy to shoot them
There are some in Latheronwheel
About  acres to the best of my knowledge
I looked up the map particularly for that
Yes
As to the common pasture
Yes
They have some  or  acres yet of pasture
All over the estate all that is not under cultivation they are allowed to pasture
I cannot answer those questions
I have
 acres and some odds
I took it down from the map bit after bit with my pencil and added it up the other day
Certainly other tenants have an equal right to the pasture
I never understood that
I should certainly say that in Latheronwheel the crofter pays a larger rent per acre than Dr Burn does for the Mains farm
Yes
No we have no other large farm
It is all divided into small farms
I should think so
I quite believe that to be true
The farm was in Major Stocks own hands when he let it out and the old steading was getting very much out of repair and was too near to his house and he had it removed entirely and a new steading built on another part of the farm
I do not see that because Major Stocks might spend what he liked on the farm when it was in his own hands but it might not be necessary to put out the same amount of money for a tenant
Because a proprietor to suit his own purpose may spend more money than if the farm had been in the hands of a tenant
Yes but the farm was in the proprietors hands for generations and never was let till Dr Burn had it so far as I know
They are
I cannot give you the reason for it
They are both very heavy but the rate for paupers is gradually coming down year by year
The parish is out of debt previously it was in debt and paying heavy interest on its overdraft at the bank
It is
I cannot say
Perhaps they had
I believe it will
A good many from the crofter class in some parts of the parish and a few from the fishing population also
Not so readily
The small crofters are apt to degenerate into paupers
I do
From forty to fifty or sixty acres
They could manage to live upon that
A holding with a pair of horses
They may not be because you may have a large family and too little land to support them
I would like the crofter to be able to live by his farm
I think it is safer than to depend on the farming partially and depend on something else for his living
I am not sure but that if subdivided there might be
There are not
No land
Yes
No by public meetings at Forse
Nothing special but I have just two or three points to touch upon
At the outset the tenants or crofters on the Lybster estate apparently have complained of no grievance
First of all under the late Duke of Portland both estates certainly were at a disadvantage so far as the estate previous to his purchase was under trustees and consequently the rents were certainly run up as high as they possibly could be the most of them but after the purchase of the estate I believe it was the policy of the late Duke of Portlandand the present Duke pursued the same policythat they are rarely known to raise the rents or remove tenants and consequently these recommendations in their favour have rendered the people quite content with the rents although they are somewhat high and also rather precarious in being paid because it must come principally out of the sea
The farms or crofts of Lybster are so convenient to the sea that they prefer though they find it rather high to make no complaint with regard to their rent
But they have another grievance
They have the parochial burdens bearing very hard upon them
In consequence of the larger farmers as it is said in this parish paying less per acre than the crofters the parochial burdens bear very high upon the crofters
That is not their only  grievance
There is the Poor Law Act and I am very happy to have to bring before this Commission the injustice of a certain clause of that Act whereby proprietors rich proprietors and even millionairesare exempt from paying the rates as tenants upon their shooting grounds
Hence it becomes very expensive to the small crofters of the parish who are rated for all the public burdens such as poor rates vaccination rate and also for registration and school rates at over s per pound
We look upon these as for the crofters one of the most particular grievances from a parochial point of view because here are wealthy proprietors who are able to pay for their shootings and they get off scot free while we have to distrain upon the poor crofter for the last farthing
I think it one of the most onesided and unjust pieces of legislation that has passed into law in Scotland within the last hundred years and I am delighted to have this opportunity of laying it before you
That is all I have to say but I shall be happy to answer any questions
I have been here twentyone years
Very important
There have been just two or three seasons and the season before lastwhen it was an entire failure but it has never been a complete failure here except those two years
They are not of such an extent
It is just the difficulty that notwithstanding the large sum of money that has been laid out the harbour is not protected from the sea
It will be absolutely necessary to serve the end it was intended for to have some breakwater thrown out on these headlands to prevent the sea coming into the harbour
Further the harbour is too shallow to admit of shipping or ordinary sized boats loaded with herring
Yes
Mr Cooper an Englishman
We are quite of that opinion
Then the entrance to the harbour is unprotected the sea comes right in and actually it is worse than before they commenced the improvements
Yes
Yes we petitioned the late Duke to have additional harbour accommodation
During a heavy storm that took place a few years ago it broke down the seawall completely and in carrying out the improvements they will not have the necessary effect without the improvements I have now suggested
Yes it is increasing in population
Yes
At one time it was not so under the late Duke of Portland but now there are plenty of facilities given
 per acre is I think the minimum
They can extend higher but that is the minimum charge
I think it is
We pay higher for some feus in the village
I pay s for a feu extending sixtyfive feet in front and one hundred feet back
Only the Parochial Board
I think about
Unquestionably we would require it for various purposes but the Parochial Board supplies all the necessary local authority
Sanitary matters are all under the Parochial Board
The only thing perhaps would be to introduce water
It would be very important if there were some constituted local authority for that purpose
Yes
Yes
They are certainly high
As it was so fully discussed I did not think it necessary to go into the matter
Yes I see that from  to  there has been a rise of  per cent on the whole of the parish
Some of the proprietors have done so but some of the proprietors I know must have laid out very little indeed
Chiefly of the tenants both small and large
They have reclaimed the land themselves and carried on the improvements
I think those who went in at first had improving leases
Nineteen years was the original lease
I know there were fourteen and sixteen but nineteen years was the general improving lease
No of course it is a short lease but during the currency of the nineteen years vast improvements were carried out upon these farms
Yes great improvements
Yes a good deal could be reclaimed and if I had the management of an estate I think I would have the ground put out in small comfortable crofts adjoining the harbour and let the land inland in large lots of from  to  acres that a man could live upon
I would allow crofts to those on the seaboard because they follow a very precarious business and if they had a croft adjacent to the harbour it would assist to support them during part of the season if they did not succeed in the fishing and the larger farms I would have so that they could live upon them alonefrom  to  acres
Evidently the crofters would require that but the inhabitants of our village could not attend to that they must be wholly fishermen
Yes
They have that not all but of course a good many of them have cows and a large common pasture for those cows
I think it does not exceed s for summer
Directly to the proprietor
Yes but it answers a twofold endfor drying nets on and also for the cow
And a profitable thing for himselfvery profitable
He takes two rents out of it
A native of the parish of Wick
It was at a meeting at Forse that I was appointed a delegate from the estate of Lybster
I am not aware of the number
I know there were a good many evictions upon that estate but I cannot tell the number
I cannot tell what was the cause unless to block out large farms
He blocked out two large farms
I dont think it
I think it is generally understood that small tenants pay fully as much rent and pay punctually
And pay as well
I have always found in my experience that they would even lift money in advance from me when fishing for me in order to pay the rent
Yes that is the farm
Yes they belong to Caithness
We do
We do as soon as we engage the boats
There are a few independent men who dont require advances but a great many require advances
They cannot carry on without it and pay these rents
Generally the little crofts are not expected to do more than keep them for part of a season
Yes a good many of them do
Yes I engage them at Wick and at Stornoway
Yes
In nearly all cases but there are a few independent men who dont require a rap
Generally speaking we have to give advances even to the West Highland men
We sometimes give them new boats
Yes sometimes not for three seasons
Yes they carry on the fishing and when they meet with success they clear us all up
Well I gave a boat at  two years ago and some nets to a crew and they fished one year for me at Boathaven and one at Wick and they cleared it off and had money to draw this season
Remarkably good
Not so good
The last season here was a complete failure and that threw a great many of them back
There were only about ten and a half crans on the average
I am referring to the spring season of  That kept them back for a long time but we have advanced boats and nets and I have seen them clear off in two years
The greater number but there are a great number who come from the Western Islands quite independent men who never lift anything
A great many of them are independent men
They go to Peterhead and Fraserburgh but a good many that fish at Latheron require advances
I am glad to hear that
I merely knew that Sir Tollemach Sinclair agitated that
We look upon it as a vexed question because it is a very great hardship on the poor crofter to distrain his effects and let the millionaire with shootings pass scot free
They are all let except the Duke of Portlands and Major Stocks
A very large rental in some cases
Yes it is great revenues that they draw from the shootings and hence we could lower the rates
I cannot say much about grouse but I know rabbits are very destructive
As for grouse we used to think they were diseased when they came into the crofts
I for one would oppose it
I should not like to see them done away with especially if we had such a revenue in our hands for parochial purposes
It is worth a great deal more than all that the grouse eat
They chiefly live on heather
Concrete walls principally
The first was to strengthen the outer walls and they excavated a certain part in the upper harbour so as to enlarge it and the one they are going on with just now is intended for an inner harbour but I am afraid it is too small for the purpose
I think it could accommodate about
I suppose they all belong to Lybster or the district
Yes of the large size
They are building them as large as fifty feet keel and fortyeight feet and fortysix feet and so on
Six men and a boy
Yes nearly all to the men
It is chiefly herring we cure but there is cod curing going on here every winter and they send them up in the state of what they call mud fish to the London market
No other reason but the want of harbour accommodation
There are as able crews and efficient fishermen as you will get anywhere but the want of a harbour deters them from going out many a night when they would go out
Provided they take all precaution to protect the entrance from the sea coming right in there is no doubt they will but unless they do that I am afraid there will be no more safety than there was before
I have heard it stated they would come to about 
I do
There is a diversity of opinion some say down near the entrance
If there were a jetty there it would protect it wonderfully and there is another plan of building a quayhead on one of the out lying rocks at the outside of the harbour
There is a little uncertainty in working it out
Probably it might be done at  probably more but it would depend very much on how they succeeded
Great storms might come on when they were in the act of erecting the quayhead and it might get knocked down
There are harbour dues just now but these are to be doubled
A boat pays s just now and Id per barrel of herring it will be d per barrel and d for a ton of salt and so on when the works are entirely completed
None whatever
I have no doubt but it is all done just now at the Dukes expense
Undoubtedly
Two and a quarter acres inside
Yes it could be excavated
To almost any extent and the more excavation the safer it would be
Yes there is the burn of Reisgill
Yes a great deal of debris
Yes not very easily but it could be done quite well at little cost
Just now they have a weir and the accumulations are kept from going into the harbour
Well there is one estate I know but I am not so well acquainted with the management of it now the Dunbeath estate
It was very particular that way
They were not very apt to remove the tenants
They must have done so at one time because they removed a whole strath of tenants but for a long time Stewart
I did not hear much about it
No I was born and brought up on it
The estate of LatheronMrs Gunns
No from the upper end of the estate of Forse where I was born and brought up and from which I was evicted
I was appointed at the first meeting we had at Latheron close upon two years ago
The march comes within a hundred yards of my door
Yes people from Forse
I lived in Forse till I was thirtyone years of age
Yes
I have a statement to make that they were evicted twentyfive years ago
Five families were evicted in one day in the upper end of Forse
Mr Sutherlandthe present Forse
He raised the rent and when he raised the rent he wanted them to put up new houses at their own expense and they could not do that
Their rent was  and then he raised it to 
No not at all
No he wanted no more but he wanted to clear them out and he said he would get the whole tenants cleared
They had houses that would do as they were but he wanted them off the place
He wanted them to put up new houses at their own expense
Divot roofs and what they call Highland couplesthe cattle and themselves going in at the same door
They lived all under the same roof only there was an old sail between the animals and the fire
Yes if they would do it themselves
No ground
They did cultivate them
It was because they cultivated the land that he put the rise on them
That was what they got for cultivating the land
A great deal of improvements but some of them did not
There were five removed in one day
There were eight removed but there were five removed in one day the roof was off and they had to go
He had them for three years in his own hand and no one offered for them
It is occupied now I believe at less rent than the tenants were paying then
It is in two farms now
Stemster Forse in the parish of Latheron
They had no place to go to unless they went to the churchyard that was near
They stopped in the barns but they were evicted out of the barns after that
Some went to the parish of Halkirk and most of them turned to be paupers after the little money they made out of their subject was gone
There were made in all one hundred and five evictions about that same time from that same estate
That was about the beginning of it
There were one hundred and five upon the estate evicted
Yes crofters and cottars
Yes
There is most of it under sheep
There is one place where thirtyfive were evicted for one farm
The farm of Rumster
No I do not believe it is higher now
The tenants were giving more rent
I believe most of them went to be paupers I attended the funerals of a good many of them from the poorhouse and they just got nothing but the funeral of an ass
The present ones have put me in as a delegate
There are very few of the old ones
There are some down at the fishings below the road
There are a few of them still in it
They have grievances of their own
The land is three times rented owing to the sea
It is on the sea they put the rents
They pay the rent for the sea not for the land
No there is another to represent them
No he is not
He was put off twentyfive years ago
He was one of those one hundred and five who were put out
His aunt was evicted that same day shewas on her deathbed
She was put out by the police and the sheriff officer under the factor and was for eight days under a sail and then she was taken away and about two months afterwards she died on another estate
Their grievance is that the rent is too high
I cannot tell
There are those here who can tell about it
About the centre of the parish
About one and a half miles south from where we are
It is two and a half miles in length and seven miles long
I believe it was owing to his fatherinlaw and his wife
They were Irish and he had to give in to their way
There was an old man who died I believe he was a pauperand they came in and told Forse that he was dead
Shepherd his fatherinlaw was there and he saidYes George that is right that is the way they should go
Yes I mean all smoking houses cottars and small places
Well there are very few on it now except what are at the fishing
There are none but two that were put out but they are lying on the face of the hill miserable worse than if they were out with the tinkers
No
We have no complaint but that we are like all the rest too high rented by the proprietor that has owned the land since twentyfive years ago and we are paying the rent that they were paying for it then
I may say we are all double rented
No
I believe there were very few that emigrated
There was very little emigration at that time
Most of them that are living are on the estate that I am on
Their parents are dead and they became paupers because they had nothing to support them
Munro had most of it then
It was small places that were on the estate of Latheron then and any of them that got better places removed and went to other places and made the best shift they could because it was a place that had nothing but rocks on it and all the green on it was not fit to be cultivated
Yes
Yes it is he who is living still
He has lived in Ireland ever since the evictions unless he comes for a short time
He may come for a night or two
The last time he was in Caithness was at the time of last election
They ran from generation to generation for I believe the memory of man but we had good proprietors in that familyas good as were in Caithnessuntil he came
Sixteen years
Yes
The estate of Latheronwheel particularly
Well there are three proprietors whose whole properties may be said to be within the district and there is a part but a very small partof a fourth
Mr Sutherland of Forse Mrs Gunn of Latheron Major Stocks of Latheronwheel and the fourth is Mr Thomson Sinclair of Freswick
Major Stocks I believe has the largest estate
The estate of Latheronwheel
I have
To Dr Burn
It was valued twentytwo years ago at  and according to the valuationroll it is now let at  It does seem inconsistent with equity that crofts should be rented so high above the rental per acre of the large farms which are usually the best soil on the property
In connection with the unequal rental per acre on large farms and crofts it is to be noted that the incidence of taxation shares with rent the same stigma of want of equitythe stronger and more favourably situated having here also the lighter burden to bear
I should say six or seven years ago but there are other delegates here who can give the information
Yes  I think not much more than that
Yes
It forms part of a farm  the proprietor cultivated a part of the pasture
He turned off those people before he made it arable land and in order to get it let he took their pasture and joined it to this newly cultivated farm
It was not far from some of it but from some it was pretty far
Yes
I should suppose not more than half a mile
No
No
I am not able to say
I never heard any statement regarding that but I believe the rule which regulated it was the provender they had in winter for their stock  that is to say the size of the cultivated land would regulate the number of stock kept
That is the statement of the tenant
Yes
I believe in a case like that many of the cattle being hardy Highland cattle would be out during the winter I suppose so though I am not sufficiently acquainted with the fact to be sure
Well at that time I do not know they purchased a great deal  but that was one of the statements made at this public meeting that a chief annoyance arising from being deprived of the sheiling is that as a tenant expressed it they have to scour the whole country and he said in his own graphic way by dint of paying and prigging and some greeting they were able to get some straw and hay throughout the country to keep their beasts alive
Simply leaving them as they were before
None whatever
Yes
I believe it has been universally taken away there is no sheiling ground now that I know of
Yes there is some common pasture
Not a very great deal
I do not suppose there was ever need for it is scarcely capable of being broken up it is very rocky heather pasture that they have either that or peat mosses
I never heard any allusion made to that
I should say the s would date back about fifty years
I am not aware whether there was a lease of any kind the tenant was allowed to do pretty much what he liked if he paid his rent
I have no reason to suppose that that was the case
I should think not the hardships in that connection is the being deprived of their pastures to so large an extent together with the rise of rent on the arable land
Well I suppose so  I do not think any tenant would grudge some increase of rent in that time although it was all by his own labour that the improvements were made
Doubtless
The tenant spoke of it as a hardship he said he had not got a farthings value for the 
I cannot say I just took down the statement as it was made at the meeting
Well some of them keep a horse and a cow some of them two cows without a horse and I know an instance or two where a horse and two cows are kept I should suppose something like eight or nine acres
Fishermen
 is the rent of one I looked at last night where a horse and two cows are kept
It is not a village Shantry is the name of the place
I was informed it was between s and s per acre
No
There are two brothers who occupy it  one is a shoemaker and the other works the farm and they both go to sea in the season
Those are the two
A few had leasesa very few only so far as I am awareand when those leases were run out I believe the truth is that the proprietor did not want to give a new one and the tenant considering the terms on which he would get a new one did not want to have it
Indeed I was told quite recently by one man that he would not have a lease on the conditions on which it would be granted
He did not mention what these would be
Without a lease I understand
Generally
They prefer to fish and farm undoubtedly
I think it is not desirable on this coast
They are not able to prosecute the fishing to the same advantage as the fishermen on the opposite side of the Firth do
I am not able perhaps to tell all the reasons why but I see the fishermen from the other side are able to be out when no boats can go out from this side and I do not see what our men would do at all during a great part of the year if they had no land
It is only the herring fishing that is prosecuted here generally speaking
A few small boats may go out for a time to fish cod and haddocks but that is solely or almost solely for the use of their families
The herring fishing is the fishing on this coast
The proprietor would get rid of them at once
So far as my experience and acquaintance with the circumstances go that would be the result
I am not able just now to specify any particular case
It is not an opinion I know they are afraid  and if dogs were seen chasing rabbits or going away off their own fields in pursuit of them that is enough to create a disturbance
Well I think if the chasing of them with a dog off the field was an offence trapping would be considered a far greater offence
The general impression on the part of the people who know the circumstances some of them to their own cost is that if they were to interfere with rabbits by means of traps or any other way they would be turned out of their holdings
Not all
There are a very few of those on the heights who go
Entirely with this exception that some of them have to go away during part of the year to work where they can get work such as at the slate quarries
In some cases
From my own knowledge I cannot say but on asking the men they said that the crofts should range from twenty to fifty acres
There are very few who have twenty acres
I do not think I know any who have twenty acres of arable land
I know one I think who has over twenty acres and he keeps two horses
That is very common
I suppose a croft of about five acres will keep a horse and a cow
About  I do not think there are many of them under   per acre
I would expect him to help so far
I believe about  or  is common for a fisherman to pay in the village of Lybster
I believe so
I do not believe he would be willing to pay more rent because he does not think the croft is worth  though he must give that for it
Well the question was put to a man at this meeting who said he had to expend  of his own money in building a house and that he would not get a halfpenny for itthe question was asked Why did you do that
and the answer was Just because I cannot lie outside
It is not always easy to do that
I am not aware
Yes I referred to that as the only one of which I had statistics and that is the only large arable farm on the property
I do not know any particulars regarding it
No I cannot say I have any special knowledge of it
I believe they are from inquiries I have been making
I am not aware of that
Certainly not
The fact is so
I believe the expenditure was very wise upon the farm
It has improved the place I should say immensely
I did not see the farm before a great part of the improvements were made upon it but I saw many of them carried out and I am convinced the money was wisely spent where it was spent
If one could say it was not to be profitable it would not be wise but one is not always able to foresee what the result of his speculations will be
About twenty years
He is a Yorkshire gentleman
Yes
The only reason I ever heard spoken of was that this piece of newlycultivated land which was made a farm of and a house built upon it would not letat least would not let wellwithout a large addition of pasture to it
That is my thorough conviction
I may be permitted to mention a statement made by one of the crofters at that meeting
He said in speaking of his own loss that some of his neighbours had managed to preserve a part of their corn by means of bells and nets and such things
I understand on making inquiry regarding the bells that they are not actual bells but old tins and pails tied to a string and suspended from a pole with a string brought into the house so that when the rabbits are seen at the other end of the croft the pails may be allowed to fall and make a noise
If a person was not afraid of being interfered with otherwise I do not think he would be at the pains to erect such an apparatus to keep the rabbits away and I am told it is not a very effective one either
No I have never seen a lease
Yes
I have no knowledge but I am led to believe it is not a common thing throughout the county for tenants to have leases
The people themselves mention fixity of tenure on condition of their crofts being revalued
One man said it would be ruinous to have them continued as they are but on condition of a revaluation they would like to have some kind of security that they could not bo cast out at any time
The next point is compensation for improvements made on their houses and on their lands so that they might better their own condition
These were the principal things and of course compensation for damages done by game which in some cases are very serious
A man told me not at the meeting but quite recently that he lost a good deal of his corn by having gathered it too green to preserve it from grouse
They were taking away all the corn from the stooks in the fields and he had to gather it hurriedly and the consequence was that he lost a good deal by that
The population of the parish of Latheron is decreasing
No there are four
The average attendance is about  or
That is my opinion though I could not perhaps account altogether for that
I believe so
Yes and they have harbours
I think it would be necessary to incur a good deal of expenditure
That is out of the question
I think so
There is a pretty good harbour already and it could be made much better and larger
I am not aware there is any local authority
The Parochial Board is the only authority
Yes
I do not know
I do not know  I am not so familiar with Lybster
Major Stocks has a residence but he does not reside here except during the shooting season
Mr Sutherland of Forse has a residence but never resides here
Quite so
Mrs Gunn of Latheron resides on the estate of Swiney so she may be considered resident though not on her own property
I am not aware
I know assistance has been given in the way of seed corn free during the last two years when there was great need by Mrs Gunn  and I believe Major Stocks procured seed corn so as to suit his tenantry but of course they had to pay for it
I think not
I cannot affirm that
A great drawback
A great deal
Yes
On some properties they have more encouragement than on others and more help given them in the way of doing it
I should certainly say they are industrious if they had opportunities
Oh yes
There are a good many who perhaps spend a good deal of their time during the winter idle having nothing to occupy them
They cannot fish and I suppose they have to be idle necessarily
I believe so
I believe if they had crofts they would be very glad to occupy themselves upon them
I certainly think they would
Yes I have no doubt of that
I am not sufficiently acquainted with the rest of the county to be able to speak very definitely
Of course there is an appearance of comfort about the small places down towards the middle of the county and towards Thurso and Wick
Certainly
Of those I have mentioned the only proprietor who has the whole moors in his own hands is Major Stocks
The shootings on the estates of Forse and Latheron are all let and partly on the estate of Dunbeath
I understand that to be the case
The two estates in Lismore which I represent are first that belonging to the Rev
Mr Fell of Carlisle and second that belonging to Major Campbell of Balliveolan
 I send you a letter that I have received from the Port Ramsay crofters on which I shall be glad to have your remarks
If the crofters are too highly rented I am willing to have their crofts revalued
But it seems to me that they have combined to put pressure upon me being apparently encouraged by the sympathy shown to the Skye crofters whose circumstances and tenure are quite distinct from the crofters in Lismore
I shall distinctly resist any attempt to coerce me
I think the crofter system a bad one
Unless every crofter has another trade or occupation a crofter living on his croft has no right to expect anything but the most abject penury
His condition is one of idleness and of necessity poverty
He does not even till his own ground but as I see from the petition he pays some one else
The crofters system should gradually be changed into small farms
In a further letter he desires me specifically to mention to those crofters his wish that the crofts should be revalued
The words which he uses areAsk the crofters if they want a revaluation of their crofts according to what is paid elsewhere
That is really the gist of the further letter
I took occasion to get the crofters together and read a petition and Mr Fells letter and they had not a word to say
I mention this fact about Port Ramsay in particular that those who live there are not crofters in the ordinary sense
Five of them own vessels
One of them carries  tons another  another   and two others  There is a boatbuilder there where many of the boats required in the island and elsewhere are built
There is a shopkeeper a retired farmer a shoemaker and four labourers only amongst the number and one widow woman
These men are enterprising  they go elsewhere
Oban would not be what it is today were if not for the Lismore people who went there
And there is in this meeting one who has benefited himself and his country by leaving the island
In  the rental of the island on Mr Fells estateand I wish these figures to be borne in mindwas  s d today it is  Is
Mr Fell the present proprietor succeeded to the property
The  is divided thus  we have five occupants of agricultural land under    eleven between  and   eight between   and  four between  and   one between    and  two between  and  and one at  And in connection with that I might mention that I have in my possession leases adjusted between proprietor and tenant in  which have not yet been signed
They have been lying twenty years signed by the proprietor but not by the tenants
If we analyse this we find the large farms extend to  acres and give a gross rent of  or s d per acre
If we take the detached crofts excluding Port Ramsay we find that of these eight in number there are  acres giving a rental of s equivalent to a per acre so that the crofters over the whole property excluding Port Ramsay are d per acre cheaper than the larger tenants
 In Port Ramsay itself where there are  crofters the area altogether is  acres
There are really   acres of ground which each crofter has got to himself
There are  acres of common and each crofter has got a house slated containing three rooms on the ground floor and a loft overhead a cows grazing this croft for potatoes and the right to cut seaware and for that they have to pay an average rent of  s d
If we had them in Oban we should charge them double straight off
The rent of Port Ramsay in  was   the rent today is  s d and in the interval we have spent upon Port Ramsay alone in improvements upon those crofts and the houses connected with them  s  d so that after debiting them with  of extra capital we have an increase in return of about  It was made out today that a large number of the houses were erected by the original settlers there
That I take to be the fact
I hold in my hands the rental of the property now Mr Fells which was then Sir John Campbells signed W
Hastie who was ground officer
He puts this footnote to it  The leases  of the Port Ramsay houses being out the houses now falling to Sir John must be looked into  in other words it was time to make an increase in the rent
But the rent of  was continued till  and now after all this expenditure of  odds it only amounts to  s d another fact which I think a helpful one in connection with the property is this
In  when Mr Fells predecessor bought the property from Sir John Campbells trustees they bought along with the property the arrears of rent amounting to  s
At November last when I made up my account the total arrears only amounted to  s d and the whole of this arrear has been paid up honestly and faithfully
Port Ramsay is the seaport of this island
It has been properly described by Hugh Carmichael who was forward here today and he gave a truthful account of how the thing stood only he omitted to say that Mr Fell not merely collects the rents but keeps the whole houses in repair
He laid out  in draining six acres of ground intended to be little patches of vegetable ground kailyards for them and this now is lying part of the common waste
I beg leave to mention one of these things which it is desirable now to mention
Mr Fell writes me a letter that their troubles have been laid before him
He says Let the tenants know that I will share their troubles with them
You can at any rate give them backI shant state the amountper cent off this half year and the future must speak for itself
I cannot form the opinion of what the tenants are able to pay and I wish you bearing in mind my interests to say whether this percentage
I do not wish to mention it because I did not act upon it
I shall tell you
Is there any material difference in the circumstances on different farms or is one equal to another in the matter of prosperity
In some cases I gave the people off  per cent in others only  I used my own discretion
I wish to point out that Mr Fell makes the interest of the tenants his own
I think I might mention also that since Mr Fell became the proprietor of this estate in  he has spent  s d on improvements upon the property
That represents buildings which of themselves have come to a very large sum
I might take leave to mention that because I wish to mention it again in connection with the houses
Houses on large farmsand I adopt the standard of the Commission in distinguishing between large and small farms  s d houses on crofts  s together  s
As to Connell Connel who was the first witness here today he says he complained regularly almost at every rent collection
It was news to me
I have collected his rent many times and although he often said times were hard he never said that he wanted anything back
He said he could not mention his past rent I think I can mention it
In  his fathers rent was in money  He also supplied  eggs  fowls  chickens one pint of seal oil  hanks of lint s for wrack Is d per side  bolls of meal making  s d   total  s d
 and his rent today is  s so that his rent is lower today by    s d  than in those days
He says there have been no improvements
I quite believe Connel persuades himself that is so but we put a capital march fence along his farm separating his lands from the feus
We have also given him materials for roofing his house and that has been done regularly
He described his ground as twenty acres
He really has  acres according to the Ordnance Survey and for that he pays  s so that he has it at about s an acre
I wish to refer to this matter of the buildings
Mr Fell is willing to spend money in buildings at  per cent which is not out of the way
Again on the other hand the tenant has means of executing the work at a much cheaper rate than Mr Fell the proprietor can do
The tenant comes and says No I shall not pay one half but I shall do the mason work for you
If he does we pay the carpenter joiner slater plasterer and plumber and build the house for him
That we consider a fair arrangement it has wrought well and I could point to many instances where it has wrought well
In the case of thatched houses we invariably give wood
There is a vessel loaded lying at Mr MIntyresplace ready to be used by tenants
As to deficiencies upon houses I think I can do no better than show you the bill of comprisement of Park
The houses there were erected fifteen years ago and under such an arrangement as I speak of
There were two slated houses in it
At the tenants entry one of these was valued at    it is now valued at  s bringing out a deficiency of s which we look upon as a fair sum to be paid by the tenant for putting it into the condition in which it was received
The other one is much larger
It was  when the tenant entered it is now  s making a difference of  s
Then in regard to the fences drains and things of that sort we look upon the tenant as responsible to give them up in fair order
Only decay in buildings or farm improvements we look upon as a thing to be provided for by the tenant and not by the proprietor and they are never charged anything but in that particular case I see there is  debited in respect of those things along with the houses
Another matter and you have caught me on the hip today because I was not prepared for it
I thought I should be able to say something in regard to Dugald Carmichael Balmaillachean who presented himself as a witness
In order to show how my relations stand with him I think it is as well I should read straight off a letter which I hold in my hands from his mother and which really gives the reason why things are as they are
I beg leave to mention that the foundation of this difficulty with Mrs Carmichael who really took up her husbands lease of the farm was this
Her husband was a pushing energetic man
He had his faults but he had his good qualities
In framing his will he cut off the eldest son with  This struck me as odd
The next phase of the matter was this
A lime work was part of the subject let
It was sublet by the father before his death to another man
As soon as the father died the family wanted to get it back again
They got the lime work back again and from that time to this they have not wrought it and in consequence some of the complainers from Port Ramsay have had to go much longer for lime that had this lime work been in operation
The consequence was a family disagreement and Mr Fell wrote to me and said  I have written to Mrs Carmichael telling her she is legally in a position to carry out her late husbands will and that I cannot allow things to go on with two masters and little labour and that if I must interfere I must give her notice which she will regret
This went on from bad to worse until in January I invited Mr Fell to come down here
He came went into the whole matter found this son was causing all the trouble and refused to leave and the only result was that Mr Fell in protection of his own interests had to get rid of her altogether
But Mr Fell wrote me again to say that if he had a small place he would let her have it
He said If I could have put Mrs Carmichael and her younger son in a smaller farm I would gladly do so but I have no such place
Mr Alexander Buchanan another delegate mentioned that when tenants had to remove as he had from his place in Balliveolan they had to leave everything behind them and get no compensation for houses and fences
I looked into odd papers I had and I saw that in  he and his brother were in arrears  and the whole of that sum was wrought out by the proprietor and tenant sharing between them the cost of the march fence which was put up by the tenants one half being credited to them in rent
Yes
In my recollection we have only ejected one man on the whole of Mr Fells property
This man I hoped to see here today
We turned him out of a little cottage that we erected at the schoolhouse of Achahoran
He erected the cottage at his own cost and fixed his price in quitting itand he took it and was well content with it
One other matter in which I feel personally very sore is this
Dugald Buchanan Balnagowan brings a reflection upon my predecessor as reputable a gentleman as ever stood in Lismore
There is a charge against him of making away with this mans meansthat he never accounted for those monies
That is so but the inference I took from it was that Mr Gregorson had declined to account and had kept some of the mans money in his pocket
Mr Gregorson died ten years ago and we advertised for all claims against him and we never heard of this and I think it unfortunate that a Lismore man should bring this charge against a man who lies in an honoured grave
I am glad it is so
He and his brother were together owing  of rent which they could not pay
In order to help them the proprietor said I shall carry out work upon your farm and you will contract with me to do it   and those men built this wall between them and somebody else
The onehalf of the contract price was placed to their credit in rent and the other half they got to themselves
No by no means
We follow the principle that what is good for a farm is only good if it pays its proportion
They bore half of the expense and the whole work was done by themselves
He made it a grievance that they went out and left houses fences and everything
Hie brother is there still
He said it was only a family disagreement that turned him out
The rent of those under  in  was  s d
 s d
It does
Yes there was a price put upon it
It is different
Crofts have been add d to larger holdings and sometimes two small holdings have been placed together to make a comfortable croft the result being that while in  we had tenants of   occupying ground to the extent of  acres we have only got  acres tenanted by people of the same description now
I have the material here but I could not tell you straight off
That has been principally in the large farms
No I meant to say that at Port Ramsay where the only increase of rent has been we have laid out  of which only a portion is charged in the shape of interest
But the large tenants have got their rents reduced in this way
The tenant says I am not content with those thatched buildings and I am willing to share the expense of making something better the proprietor says I am happy to meet you and the rent was charged at a slightly lower figure than we would get if there were no buildings on the property
Lower to the extent of d per acre  and looking to the quality of the land and comparing it with that occupied by the larger tenants I am satisfied the crofters have equally good and in most cases better land
I have facts to a certain extent to go upon
I think the question was put to him with reference to Port Ramsay
I challenge that statement

It was of the Duke of Argylls estate I was speaking I think
Witness
The difference is so slight that I would not like to say but I think looking to the quality of the ground and comparing the places you will find the difference to be very trilling indeed
A very considerable number
Twentyone occupants of houses who have got no land except gardens connected with them and estimating a number of paupers and those who do not pay rent there there might be another dozen
There might be at any rate thirtyfive families on Mr Fells estate without land
They are dotted all over some in Port Ramsay and others right over the whole place principally along the public roads
In most places they pay s and get it back again
We merely insist upon payment in order to satisfy them that they are sitting there and under obligation to the proprietor
The largerfarms principally
Where they are in centres they are upon the larger farms
We have got upon one farm alone six of them all sitting together
I have no complaint as to that I fancy they are allowed to move about pretty much
That must be taken with a certain amount of caution
There was about fifteen acres of peat in the land and this was all wrought out
The last quantities of peat taken were soft fibrous peat which had no good quality as fuel
That has disappeared
But if you take into account that a man has to leave his home three miles off and dig peat and turn them to dry and then take them three miles home I should think he is cheaper with coals
He thought so but I dont think he would take them now
They are not to be had
I must have them
They will be in Oban
I will look into the matter if you wish
I cannot say
Oh no
No
I dont think Mr Gregorson could have slept in his bed if he had done the man injustice
Possibly
Perhaps so
Yes
Yes There has always been a fight to have two members from Lismore
Yes
Yes
There was another complaint made by Duncan Carmichael in respect of another injustice this year in putting out a widow because she was a widow
This was a joint tenancyJohn and Hugh MGregor which is a common thingtwo brothers associated together and yet although their names appear together in the rent book they actually paid their rents separately getting only the one receipt for the cumulo sum
In this case the man died his affairs were not in a good way and if I were to show you the balance after the accounting that this widow with seven children had at her disposal you would see that it was not sufficient to meet the rent of  s
That was one reason
That is so for herself and seven children
One twentyone and they ran down to nothing
Yes
That is so
Take an instance
A man was drowned coming from Sheep Island and his wife was left with a young family
Mr Fell put her into the place of her husband and gave her a present of the half years rent and there she is today
Something would have been done in the case of the people complaining if the circumstances had been otherwise than they are
I gave a brother of Carmichael a piece of ground and he and his mother are living in it in the hope that this lad would go away but he has not
The money is the mothers although the lease is in the name of her son
These are the only two that occur to me at the moment
Yes
When he comes down I take the opportunity of going into these matters with him
NA
Mr Fells
J
Fraser Sim
I think at Whitsunday
I should say it is at least I would not like to live in the houses
Yes during the past season there have been measles but there has been an epidemic over the whole district
But in winter the children are very apt to catch colds which I attribute principally to the house accommodation
That they are so open  so many draughts too much ventilation
Yes
They dont look warm to a person who goes in
I believe it is in one or two cases not more
Yes
No
Not that I know of
My impression is that little encouragement is given to providing house accommodation
But I cannot speak positively
I know the general way in which houses are put up which you have heard already  the proprietor paying half and the tenant the other half or the proprietor putting up a house and the tenant paying interest for it or rent
Some of them say it is  per cent that is chargedthat is on Mr Fells estate
No
Not that I am aware of
Yes
I cannot say very well as to how they are off
They do not look very well off a great many of them
I dont know
Probably so  I cannot say
Not that I know of
Because he knew I wrote out the petition for the people
I asked him first what he intended to do if I should give him the information
I asked if he would do the man any harm and he said no
Then I asked why he wanted the information and he said he wanted to keep his eye upon him
I am in the habit of doing everything of that sort whether it is for that purpose or any other
Yes it is quite the habit
I have done many things of that kind
Yes simply to put the thing in proper form for any person who wishes it done
It is understood I am neither pulling one way nor another
Yes I know my business is not that of an agitator of any sort
They are attentive enough in everyway except in the enforcement of the compulsory clause they are a little lax in that way
As far as I know
Yes the local members of the School Board generally give the children a trip
No
The chairman is Dr Campbell Ballachulish the Episcopal Minister Ballachulish Mr Currie hotel keeper Ballachulish Mr McDougall minister Duror Dr Mackay Port Appin Mr Mackay and Mr Alexander MColl Park
Yes the last election was contested
There was no question of religion brought to the front last time
Yes
The people here divided their votes between two candidates from the island and both these were carried
They did so in order to get the island represented by two members
Yes
Not that I am aware of I never heard of such a thing
No I am a native of Forfarshire
No
No
Yes
About seventeen births in the year
Two or three of these come from Kingairloch a district over in Morven  perhaps about fifteen in the island
The deaths are at least equal to that
That is for the past two or three years
Yes  the deaths rather have it
Yes there are not more than two marriages in the year
I do not think so
Mr Paterson of Kilchearan does not reside here
He has a manager on the place
I cannot say
A good deal
Perhaps between a third and a half  but I cannot say positively
No
Mr Paterson is the only nonresident tenant
The most of it
No
Yes they speak English fairly welL
Yes
Yes I have always found him a gentlemanly man and a kind man
Mr Fell I believe distributes money and goods among the poor occasionally
I think so
Ten crofters
About twentyfive
No they are scattered here and there and are on the roadside as close to the road as possible
Separate from the crofts on the public roadside where they dont tramp on any grass
Some of them do but they refuse to take any rent from others
I dont know because the houses are not worth it I suppose that it would be a shame to take rent for them
They would be glad to offer it rather than be evicted
Yes if they would go away quietly
Well I know the general run of them
Indeed they are hard pushed to pay the rent the rents are very high
They were telling me they average from   to  and  s for each cow they keep on the croft
Those  who have two cows and scant to keep them pay   there is one beside  me and he has just one cow and he keeps that cow comfortably and pays  
No none
No sheep
They employ one of the large farmers to plough it in the spring time
Highland cattle generally but some of them are sometimes not able to afford to have any kind of cattle
No he is a smith and works at his trade
They all work upon their crofts
There  is no employment for them unless Mr MIntyre who keeps the lime  quarries going employs them
That is the only means of living in this  island quarrying
Yes  there is one just now beside me who pays  of rent and who has two  cows and I believe the place would keep three if he had them
But he  had no way of living this summer if it had not been for MIntyre who  has given employment to many persons in distress
Very good indeed
Excellent potatoes and all kinds of crops  if the land is laboured it yields a good crop of whatsoever kind
Generally they do
They sell them to different persons who come round and buy them
No they buy them at home the Irish never come over here
Oban people take them
No
No
From twelve to sixteen and eighteen and if the seed crop is good they give twentyfive barrels
Since the new seed came here the  Champion  has been yielding twentyfive barrels in a good year
The  soil is good but it is not left to the people who are inclined to work  it  there are so many independent people who want the land just now  for grazing purposes that those inclined to work the land do not get the  chance of doing it
If you seek a piece of the land you work it and  make yourself comfortable you will be just left out
Some of them are boating and some are shoemakers and some carpenters and some masons and others at different work
Yes
Yes there are two or three
Well  I was going to foreign ports in my young days but then I settled down  and got married and stayed at home and got a little smack and am  supporting myself and family
I work for Mr MIntyre generally
To the Isle of Skye and Coll and Tyree and Morven and Arisaig and Moidart and in all directions
Sometimes  we have no reason to complain and at other times there is not much
The county is now going so much under grass that there is not so much  demand for lime as there used to be
No
There are four houses on the estate which were built by Mrs Cheyne for  those who were on the roll but shortly after that she was advised to  take these houses because they were thought too good for the paupers  and let them to cottars and she then got them let and put  of rent on  each house and there is just a little short bit of ground about the  breadth of the house with a garden laid out in front
The rest of the  houses had no gardens at one time  and now those who were evicted at  the other end and got houses here have become old people and the  younger ones being away working throughout the country the gardens went  down and the walls were destroyed and never rebuilt and still the  crofters claim these gardens and the cottars cannot get them
I made an  arrangement with the under factor and the Duke was for building me a  house and I was to get  from the Duke
Well I was giving that to the  factor to do the quarrying and I was to build the house and do all the  rest of the work and yet pay a rent of s d and when I asked for a  garden he told me I would get a spot for a midden at the back of the  house but no garden
No I have one on another farmers ground
I was told yesterday that he was paying  of rent foment every cow that he has and that I would have to pay likewise
He feeds her I suppose as he does his own
Yes I believe so
No  that is the great evil
The farmer has been in the place altogether for  these twenty years back and the markets are so good that they are  feeding the calves and giving them all the milk and there is none left  for the cottars
Yes we used to get the milk liberally to buy  if we do buy it now it is not worth carrying just sour milk
Plenty
The  whole of them could
There are those who were evicted off the land
They were not evicted because they had no means tbey had the means as  they have yet
Yes they would be glad to take the land back at a reasonable valuationtwenty families of them
Mr  MIntyre keeps generally from twelve to sixteen and more if he could  get them
He would get as many as he liked in spring time
Yes
Yes
Yes this is the third generation that is working in it
We have
Yes
They do generally attend the school
They all go south  there is nothing here to keep them
Some of them do
Some of them prosper very well and some dont
No  there were better scholars made in my time in that school than there  are now because the rule is now that the children must stick in the  school until they get to standard six and then away they go
The  teacher allows them to remain in school after that but she dont like  them to come after that
But all she is under an obligation for she  teaches them
Yes we had a very good teacher indeed  but she has left us now
It  was old Mr MGill the parish schoolmaster and supposing we were away  labouring or at farm service in the summer time and spring time we  could all go to school in the winter and he would be glad to receive  us
Yes
More scholars than there are now
No because the teacher dont care for them over that age
He  will just come once in the year and he just comes ashore out of his  yacht and goes into the machine and drives right along to the end of  the estate and drives back and gets on board the yacht and then away  he goes
We never get the pleasure to say one word to him at all
He is the person upon whom the whole island relies especially the poor and working class
It would be a gracious thing if the like of him had the land between them

The witness Cameron said the average produce of a barrel of  potatoes in Lismore was from  to  returns
The average to people  well acquainted with cultivation as I have been is  barrels
Sometimes the return is   and  but that is not the average
The average I consider would be  barrels
The former witness accuses me of being the means of putting the farm of Park up in rent which I wish to say is a mistake
No the farm was open in February and March last and there were different offers besides mine and I was told by the proprietor there were higher offers than mine
But this was four years ago
He accused me of being the means of raising the rent I think at the time of the expiry of a certain lease which I hold is a mistake
I say I have not been the means of raising the rent in any form
At the meeting here there were six or seven people appointed to communicate with the Commission today and I dont desire to say anything indeed I have nothing to say any way
I think it was if I remember but I dont speak for it
No and I didnt offer until I was asked to give in the offer
It was when I made the application for it
It was in the market any way and there were different offers in besides mine and I was told there were higher offers than mine although they chose me as their tenant
I gotit at Whitsunday last
No
Yes
I think the arrangement is that I take over the corn crop at a valuation the potatoes they can take with them
I happened to buy about an acre and a half at Whitsunday from the outgoing tenant
He had too much under green crop to work it and I happened to buy it
No I bought it he paid the rent
I bought it so that I might get it put in turnips
I allowed him after Whitsunday to put in his turnips as they were not in
If I had liked I could have prevented him from turning any more of the ground after my entry  but as we had been neighbours a long time I allowed him to put them in after the Whitsunday term
He is
That was my own goodwill
I have a portionthe portion I bought
I expect the incoming tenant is bound to take the corn crop at a valuation but not the green crop
I am not a delegate appointed by other people I wish to come and state my own case about how I was dealt with long ago
But those who illtreated me are all dead and I dont know whether you will allow me to proceed with my case
I fell into some arrears about eighteen years ago and the factor deprived me of my holding
It was upon Mr Fells estate that this occurred just about the time he entered upon possession
I believe the actual perpetrator of the deed was Mr Haig
The factor came and asked me for my arrears and I told him I could not pay them at the time but if he would give me some assistance in fencing at the back of the croft I would endeavour to pay them as soon as I could
My horse unfortunately failed at the time and was worth nothing at all and I believe that was the reason why the factor had no patience with me in my arrears
Then immediately after I was dispossessed he wanted to fence all round to make it a grazing park for sheep
The laird had to bear plenty of expense on that account
The laird sent from Oban for me and the ground officer and myself went across
The proprietor made me sign a paper to arrange matters with the ground officer in order to save expense and I did so in the expectation that anything that remained over after the arrears wore paid should come to myself
Well the stock was rouped first
Of course the horse counted for nothing but I gave a bill of sale over to the factor
Then the crops were rouped and I never got an account from the factor or proprietor with respect to this sale nor do I know to the present day whether the proceeds of the stock and crop were able to pay the arrears or whether there was a balance over
My grandfathers were in the place and my father had been there forty years and I was there for seven years after that and the arrears altogether amounted to  s d
Then of course there was the whole expense of valuation and additional expenses
There was the halfyears rent due at Whitsunday which made  s more
Three cows and two queys that was all the stock then the crops were selling cheaply in that year
During the whole time of my own and my fathers tenancy the laird had no outlay whatever upon fences or buildings everything that was done was done at our own expense
The value was about 
The first roup came to about forty guineas and the second to 
Well I got   twice
I had to support my family  and I would go over to the factor and he would be busy and would ask me to come another day but although I should be going every day I dont think I would get anything more
Mr Gregorson
I had neighbours who were treated in the same way  but they are not living now
I think the previous delegate spoke about that
We did not get justice at any rate we were swept away out of the place
There was an epidemic or fever at the time  but I cannot state the actual facts with respect to any person but myself
I repeat distinctly that I never got an account from the factor of the proceeds of the sale of my stock and crops
I dont know that I would even have got a house had it not been for a kindhearted tenant who came into my place
It was he who provided a house for my mother and myself so that it cannot be said that I was indebted to the proprietor even for a house
Yes I thought it was my duty when the like of you were appointed to hear such cases
It was given to the Mr MCall who had the township of Firefour
It was then given to another MCall and it is now given to the farm connected with the mill
It was added to the neighbouring township
Mr MCall who got it did not ask or seek my place
No it forms only about two crofts mine and another of much the same size and rent
It was a dear rent  s
Yes I have been working with father and son for the last eighteen years in steady employment
No we can work only when the weather is good
Yes unless there is iceif it is only dry frost but if it is slippery we cannot
I worked at first by days work and now I work by days wage and I cannot compare them
Our wages now are s under the former arrangement it was once better twice worse
When I lost the land it was but a poor timetimes were bad and if Mr MIntyre had not given me work I might have starved altogether  but now work is more common
Well I believe I like upon the whole the days wage as well
I only came into the place at last term we were put out of the place in which we were
I was chosen at a general meeting here to speak with respect to the condition of the whole place
I am the son of a tenant and I have been at tenants work all along and I am able to speak of that ever since I remember
No my father was fortysix years in the place and he died  but my mother was evicted from the place at the last term
Park
The same place
Mr Fell
Yes she is a widow
I am not aware of any other reason there were no arrears
Yes it is  this year at any rate
None of the widows this year or last year after they were removed got a house upon the estate of Mr Fell
No it was not the practice and others who built their own housesthe whole of themthe regulation has been made that unless you pay so much for them you will be turned out although you might not have any means whateverthe worth of a hen
For the houses
Yes
According as they think the tenant is able to pay some s some more  you could not expect a poor woman to be able to pay very high rent
But although she might have to beg for it pay it she must or go she must
About four years ago
Four years after his death
Not so far as I know I didnt hear any reason given
Yes and I am working at the corn there yet
We have potatoes and corn in our own hands yet and I am lodging here
My brother has got another one but I have not
Yes there was another widow treated in the very same way this year
She was only one year in possession during her widowhood
Carlisle
Yes
Yes
The first thing which I have been requested by the people to state is that there are three fresh water lochs in Lismore and there was a mill upon each
Now fifty years ago these three mills were in working order and each of them ground three times as much as the one mill now grinds for the whole place
There is only one mill now
Now since place was added to place and since the holdings were taken from the people there is only room for shepherds to work  there is no farm work going on in the place for young men
It is very good for the man who is able to get that work but it is only one in twenty who gets that kind of work
This kind of work commenced since I remember first when Mr Fell got possession of the property
He ejected a widow who was in possession of the mill at the timethat is the mill which is now in working order some ten years ago and she would not get a house upon the estate when she left
Again there were three tenants in that same place called Firefour
These three were sent away and they would not get a place upon the estate it was made into one lot and given to a farmera tenant
The reason given for clearing these townships was that there was fever in the place and one family got their death in consequence of the fever and then the other two were turned away  and the place was offered to that other tenant at a reduction of some  or   last year
He would not take it at that reduction and it was he who came and got my mothers holding
There is another township beside that again called Balucrachdagh
The tenant in one of these lots died last winter and the widow was ejected at the term and she has not a house upon the estate yet
This is the widow whom I mentioned formerly
She was not in arrears of rent and she had a family who could keep up the place just as our family could have done my mothers place
Then the people specially complain of their bad houses
With respect to the houses if the proprietor expended any money upon them  interest was laid upon this outlay which would virtually become an increase of rent for it never was taken off
Then if the tenant himself expended anything on it he did it at his own expense and was not to get any compensation for it  rather the other way for if the house had deteriorated meanwhile he had to pay the difference
In some cases he has provided half the expense and the tenant the other half but when the tenant removes he gets nothing for the other halfthe property becomes entirely the landlords
We have had frightful storms here for the last two or three years which injured the crofts of the tenants very much in this district especially upon this estate of Mr Fell
Some of the tenants down by the seashore had the potatoes taken out of their very beds by the sea
Mr Fell gave a little reduction upon the rent and one man who was not able to pay the rent for that year the full rent was charged against him without any abatement being made and interest as well
Then upon the last place my father built a slated house
The proprietor paid half  of the expense and we paid half the insurance money the proprietor paving the other half
I expected some indemnity when we left for this half
We also built a barn last year and the proprietor provided a roof
We ourselves did the mason work and added   more and the proprietor did the rest
Now instead of getting any indemnity at all for our outlay on this building the proprietor is going to insist upon a valuation of the buildings and make us pay the difference between their present value and their value when put up
Now when my father entered upon that croft there was no grass seed sown
It was a soft place and there were peats there and the whole estate had the right to cut peats thereso much had ground for every cow
My father began to drain this place and the people who were cutting peats there were obliged to cease cutting them
Some of the place is still undrained bog as any passing man can see
Now my father entered upon a lease and I asked that I should get the lease in order to see that the terms of the lease were adhered to when I was leaving the place and I was told that the lease was lost that it was not to be found
Mr MIntyre the ground officer
There was no copy made of the lease
The first lease was for nineteen years and that lease was drawn out in form and at the expiry of the lease there was only a written agreement between the proprietor and my father that the tenure was in terms of the previous lease
I believe that the second lease was only for eleven years
No  two years
Yes
No
Now about nineteen years ago when Mr Gregorson was factor he made certain laws in Oban and he sent two factors round here with them stating that any person who would not submit to these statutes would got notice to quit
Yes they were printed and the people were signing them  but there were no copies left with the people
One of the conditions of these rules or statutes was that the cultivation was to proceed by rotationoats potatoes oats ryegrass pasture and if we brought in any new ground we were only allowed to take one crop of oats off it
Now this is one of the chief grievances that the people here have that they are not allowed to take two oat crops off such a piece of ground because they are not near enough to the market town to sell their corn and live chiefly by their stock
I could not say I think about one hundred acres

Yes
No a tenant had it before my father
Then we asked the laird if he would give us one of the places that had become vacant if he should remove us out of the place and he did not give us any of them nor would he give us any reason why
He did not tell us if he had anything against us
I am just looking out for a croft and a wife at the same time
I could not say but I was appointed in the meeting
The chief grievance that the people who elected me impressed me with was that they are made to pay interest for any outlay by the proprietors in improving their houses
This increases their rent and makes it impossible for them to keep by their holdings for the rent is getting dearer and dearer and never getting cheaper
I answer yes to the general question  but I know of no case where the total outlay was made by the tenant
It is in the case of a divided outlay that the complaint is where the proprietor provides about half and the tenant by labour or outlay the other half and the complaint is that when the tenant is being removed a valuation is made upon the whole property and the tenant pays for any depreciation
Upon the whole property
No that is not the way we proceed
The mode of procedure is this the factor comes round once a year or every six months and he sees something needing improvement in the buildings and he sends a person from Oban to make the repairs and charges me with these when I am paying my rent say at the next term and then at the end of the tenancy a valuation is made and I am made to pay the difference in value between the property at the beginning and at the end of my tenancy
I have not seen a case where that would hold
We built our own barn only last year and we are asked to pay s for deterioration in the twelvemonth
The last witness did not explain exactly about the grass
When Mr Cheyne commenced to remove the tenants he made them lay out a piece of arable land for a year under grass what the tenant should have had under cultivation and he made the tenant sow this piece every year with rye grass and after he got the whole arable land under rye grass he sent the tenant about his business and took all to himself for stock
That was the reason for his making them sow it under grass that he might send the tenant about his business and take the croft to himself and he did so until he had the whole estate cleared except a part of Auchnacroish and Killean
Yes the full rent
I cannot say for that
Yes and sow it down with grass
Yes one by one until he had the whole estate to himself
I believe he did
I think the potato disease commenced about  or
There might have been symptoms of it then
No I am on the estate of Captain Campbell
Fifeshire I think
He was an advocate
He had Woodcockdale in Linlithgowshire I think and another estate in Fifeshire
No but I recollect it
Yes when I was young the population in Lismore was  The parish schoolmaster we had told me a year or two before he died that when he came to Lismore the population was I think  and now it is not much more than
I think
Perhaps so
Equally as fertile to give it justice as it ought to get
It would be of no use because the present tenantMr Patersonhas a lease and during his lease the Duke would not do that
Yes
There was one Mr Stewart at one time a Dumfries farmer but it is since Mr Paterson took it that the Duke of Argyll bought the estate
Mrs Cheyne had the estate for a good number of years and then it was bought by the Duke of Argyll
Not many years ago
I dont know the exact number perhaps seven or eight
Often once every year almost although he has not been here this year yet
Well he does not encourage great improvements so far as I know
Maybe two years until he got the ground in order for himself
At the tenants expense
Yes and sometimes he sent the tenant away and took hold of everything
I had an uncle who had a croft and he might be   or  in arrears
He was getting old and of a religious disposition and Mr Cheyne was always bothering him for arrears and he sent horses and cattle to Mr Cheyne and he never got a farthing back although they would have brought a good deal more than the amount of his debt
I could not say but he took the stock of those who were in arrears
Yes I believe so
Yes but I cannot say whether any one of them is to speak today
Some may have gone to America but not very many I think
They are doing pretty well I believe
They are work ng away as best they cansome of them doing well and some indifferently
Yes there are a number of crofts in Killean on the Dukes estate
I had a croft in Ballyveolan with my brother but I am not in it now
I cannot say
I was in a manner forced to give it up because I was an old bachelor like a great many others I dont know whether you are one or not
There was a disagreement in the family and the factor was helping me
The factors are the greatest evil in this countryour landlord we seldom seealthough he is a fine man Captain Campbell But we have a bad law in Lismore with regard to crofts
A poor tenant has here to build his own house and paper it and do everything and he may be removed next year because there is no lease we are all tenants at will
For instance I built a new house byre and everything and perhaps I would get a few cabers to put upon it  the next year if I had to leave the house people would be sent to see what it was worth and I would have to pay the difference and march and dykes the same way
Yes and that of almost every other proprietor in Lismore in my young days
I dont know exactly how they are now
Labourer
With Mr MIntyre the lime merchant
Yes I am happy to say constantly
Pretty good as good as what are going in the country and I am willing to have it as it is
Work is not easy to get in this island
No so much a week a day or year
About s or  a week less or more
Sometimes they did work by the piece in the quarry where I am but not now
The people are as well off working by time as on piece work
I believe they are as happy and it is as good as if we were on piece work
That is the wages here and it is more in some places
Farm labourers dont work by the day or week
I dont know how much the farmers give the labourers but when I had a farm I used to give s d or s a day for their services during harvest I never employed labourers at any other time of the year
I am in lodgings
Yes it is my own fault
They wanted me to speak with respect to the estatethat portion of it upon the south end of the island under the Duke of Argyll and held by one farmer
My own choice
I have seen three lairds on that estate
When I was a young man there was a laird who was an object of praise for his conduct towards his tenantry and the poor
When that man died the estate was bought by another who promised well but he remained a good proprietor only a very short time
He deprived us of our peat ground
Then it appeared it was his intention to put stock of his own upon the whole estate
The property consisted of six or seven townships
There have been over  or  souls there and over the whole tract now there are only three shepherds and a manager
He exacted some conditionsI do not know properly what they werefrom his tenantry
There was a field of ryegrass green and he was sending us away one after the other and he himself gathering stock which he placed upon every place as it became vacant I dont know for how many years he insisted upon grass being in those places instead of its being arable land
When he got the whole place under grass instead of under crops then he stocked it all and the people were all away by that time
Those who had the means to take them to America went there and some went to the large towns
The poorest became labourers to him at Is a day for the men and d for the women and they were paid each Saturday by a sort of meal
If they would not go to work for him on these terms he threatened to pull down the houses of the poor people about their ears
I didnt mean a different quality of meal when I said a sort of meal It was oatmeal only one year when there was a want of oatmeal he got barley meal and ground it down
About thirty or thirtytwo years ago
Yes
I have seen some of these people who formerly had crops and cattle and butter and cheese and milk afterwards in those years going with their barley scone to a good well which was beside us when we were building and take their mealbarley and water and it grieved me sorely
My father and brother and myself were boat builders building boats for those who required them bringing seaware ashore and other things
We built boats for the district round about
Latterly nobody upon the estate required a boat
Yes to a certain extent but not the whole extent
I have seen a great quantity of potatoes exported from this place when people were here
I have seen  tons sent out two of the townships in one year to Liverpool and leaving a sufficient amount for the people of the place
Yes
The first proprietor that I remember was the one who was so good to his tenantryDavid Campbell
They called him Combie
The next who came was Cheyne from Fifeshire
He died leaving the place all under stock of his own
The property was in the possession of Mrs Choyne for several years after her husbands death but after his death a tacksman named Stewart got the place
At the death of Mrs Cheyne the property was bought by the Duke of Argyll
The present tacksman is Mr Paterson
Since the Duke bought the property it has always been under one tacksman
There would be onehalf of the township or so in the hands of three or four crofters at one time  afterwards the whole estate was under one farmer
Kilchairan village
Yes Runnafiartor I might call the first two townships Runnafiart and Fiart itself Achananad Balagrundle Greaganaich Gortcharrain Achanacroighbut I think that last place has still people on the onehalf of it  and Killean
I cannot say
It was this stocking of the land which was laid out in grass that was injuring us
He compelled us to leave out a certain porton of the croft in grass each year
He himself put stock upon it and so the arable ground of our croft was continually reduced and then he sent us away
I am not aware that he raised the rent
There is the marrow ot the whole matter
We had about that time four sheep and under one of the conditions we were deprived of them and then we were not allowed to keep a pig and things of that kind which contributed to pay our rents
That was it
It was the present Duke
I have nothing to say with respect to him
The administration of the property remains as it was when he got it he has done a good turn to us on our isle herehe has built a pier
I never heard
No I could not stand the place I had to flee away from it
I was not sent off I had to flee away
The very customers to whom we supplied boats were not allowed to come and purchase boats from us
I made no application anyhow
It is about twentyeight years since I left the place
I am not aware
There was a man appointed to come forward a Mr Black from Oban but he has not come else he might have spoken on the matter
He and Mr Cheyne were at law for about two years in respect to his own place
Whatever his rights might have been he was endeavouring to assert them
The people of the place used to say that if he had been as wealthy as Mr Cheyne was he would be put out
I can say those magnificent dales once cultivated are now being covered over with useless weeds and moss as if the land itself were to say  I shall return to my original state
No
I might give a pretty close guess
The place was allotted out into crofts of such a size that each tenant kept four milk cows six and eight was the average
In addition to this stock that I mentioned Mr Campbell the good proprietor allotted out parks in certain districts where the tenants were allowed to keep young stock and farrow cows and they might have perhaps six queys there some stirks and a horse or two and a place to summer and winter them
They were in the habit of preserving onefourth of the place during the whole three months of autumn without pasturing upon it at all so that it would afford good pasture ground in winter
And this good proprietor again sent a fresh bid every second year to these tenantry and improved the stock so that it can be seen to the present day
The stock were so improved that the cattle dealers as they came down specially fancied the cattle of these townships
Yes
There is the onehalf of Achnacroish and also Killean in the hands of small tenants
I cannot say how many there are in Killean
Some of the crofts have been made larger upon these places
I believe he commenced by giving them the seed grass
He gave them seed grass in the first years whatever so far as I can remember
Well you know he was sending them away and then he was putting stock upon the ground
It is my opinion he began to send some of them away before the potato disease but I cannot speak with certainty
I believe the clearing was going on thirty years ago
Yes
that of Mr Fell
Our peats have become exhausted and we are obliged to buy coals which costs us   or  a year
Four
It has been there for a very long time my father and grandfathers were crofters there before me
There were neither more nor fewer just the same as now the township was divided into four parts
No none
When I first paid rent after my father twentyfour years ago the rent was  s
There has been no increase in my time
I cannot tell what the increase of rent was in my fathers time but it was raised There was a great deal of smuggling going on in the Highlands in those days and barley brought a good price and rents were increased in consequence and they have not been taken down since
Three cows and a horse which I feed in winter but have to send out to graze in summer
Two calves and a stirk
Two sheep
It has never been measured in my time  but so far as I know there are twenty acres altogether including pasture
Thirty years at least
Our complaint is that we have to buy coals instead of the fuel we had formerly when we paid the same rent as now
No
The prices have gone up and down in that time
There were times when they fell as much as they rose
No
My father built it
At that time all the tenants built their own houses
Mr Fell
I dont know his practice because as regards myself there have been no such improvements made
No
No it is not a place for draininghard rocky land
I believe that where such improvements were made the tenant paid the half but I cannot speak certainly as I have made none myself
There have been no evictions from any township so far as I know
There are others who can tell better than I can as to other places with which I have no personal acquaintance
There has been nothing done in my time at this end of the island
No
We have complained to the factor about it
We have never until now laid our heads together to do so but each of us has always complained for himself to the factor of the highness of the rent
No
Perhaps we complained every time that we paid the rentcomplained that there was too much of it to pay
No
Each has his own land surrounded by a dyke
About  s for the half year
It varies accordingly as the ground is suitable
No
I cannot give any estimate of the extent of it
There is a good deal of it quite unfit for cultivation being  very rocky
No not quite so much
Sometimes more sometimes less about 
No my crop is for the feeding of the cattle in winter
Highland cattle
It is always Highland cattle we keep here but not always the same as they used to be
If they were the same as they formerly were they would be of very little worth
Oh yes and I believe I may say they get fresh bulls every year
I dont know that any of them keep any other stock but Highland and they are good cattle
I dont know until I see it
Scarcely
I was young then and the world was not giving me so much care and therefore I lived better
If the price of the coals were deducted from the rent I would be content
We use between seven and eight tons of coal in the year and when the price varies from s to s a ton it comes heavy upon us
Eighteen years
Yes
Yes
The population is less now
Not so much now because I am differently paid I am better paid now than I was before owing to the new Act it did not affect my emoluments but it affects the number
The first year I have seen a weekly attendance of ninetytwo that is the highest weekly average I ever had
Now the highest weekly average will be about thirty
Not quite so good
Probably an average of twentyseven on the year
Thirtyfive or thirtyseven
I could not exactly say
Yes
A good many went away at one time as far as I recollect and a number came to the village and those who could not be accommodated there went somewhere else
Yes
No it was the year before I came
I could not say they did not appear altogether empty indeed most of them had a little money so far as I could understand arising from the sale of their cattle
And some were better off they had larger farms which they had lefttwentyeight pounders
There has not been a house built since that so far as I recollect
I cannot say what it was previous to that
I cannot see any difference
No I dont
Yes
I am not aware of it
I could not say there was any more than one family in one room
I cannot say there is more than one family in one room
There may be an exception a young man may have married and brought in his wife temporarily
A good many I think
Because the houses have been allowed to fall into disrepair
The roofs are off the old houses
The feuars houses are fairly good and those of the proprietor the people have to make them decent themselves
They have to keep them up I suppose themselves
Yes I know a family or two who occupy one room
They have generally a room and a closet
With the exception of one I think not
Because it could not be let
Yes it belongs to Mr MCallum writer Tobermory
I dont know
I dont know
I dont know I know what he was asking
 s
That is what I understand
Yes it is
Yes
We have no compulsory officer
Yes
So far as I know
That rests with the Board of Supervision
No
There was a case or two of measles lately
Yes
Colonel Cheape Mr Gordon Captain Shaw Mr Elliot and Mr Robertson
Sometimes
Three
I think so
Fifty
Of the population at that time there are very few now living with the exception of some labourers
There are more paupers I think
I think they are equally as well fed and better clothed
They may have been quite as substantial formerly but they appear better clothed
I think they are so far as I am aware
I admit that some of those poor people when they left their crofts were getting old and frail and a number of them came to the village and they became objects of parochial relief
Possibly so
Very soon I believe
To Ardgour
Yes
Yes
Yes
Ardgour in my time
I cannot speak as to the crofters here before I came
I know no crofters in the parish and cant say
I hope not
I think it has taken a turn
I expect an increase on this particular estate
Yes so far as labourers are concerned I cannot speak as to crofters
Yes
Exactly so
I believe it is
I cannot exactly say
So far as I am able to judge myself
I would not be inclined to do it
Yes
I am not aware of that
I believe they come both from labourers and crofters
No I cannot charge my memory at present with it
That is what I meant
I would like to know whether he was a crofter with four cows or one cow
Two cows thenI would prefer a crofter in my own day with two cows to a labourer of the present time
They might have come in but they have never visited me by surprise or in that way
Oh yes speaking to me they have done so
Not in my school
Yes
Not a bit
No I endeavour to do my duty conscientiously and I do not care whether they come or not
No
None whatever
Not now
I certainly do think that prizes should be given
By no means the oftener the better
That was the impression it made upon me
Certainly I do not object to that
Yes
Not the slightest
Certainly that is my impression
It has not been done for the last ten or twelve years
It formerly was done when there was a Presbyterial examination
Yes every year
At last examination there was Mr Sellar MP for Haddington
Either last year or the year before
It was at the Government inspection he came
I am
Yes
On the estate of the late Sir Charles Gordon in Drimnin
Yes
I cannot tell
Yes it was I believe held as a club farm
Not so much
Oronsay
It is
It was one club farm the whole of it
Yes there were first six and afterwards there were only four so far as I can remember
My father was not
He died and rny mother had to give up the land
Nearly twenty years now
Always
One of those who was in Oronsay was the last delegate another is in Glasgow he removed to Glasgowand two or three are on the adjoining estate of Mr Dalgleish Ardnamurchan
Yes
A large farmer
Donald MMaster
The upper end of the district here
He was a shepherd formerly on Mr Smiths estates
I believe he is  I believe he was born in this parish
It belonged I believe to MLean
That was the name of the proprietor before Sir Charles Gordon bought the estate
It is not a very large estate
It is just now in two farms and the home farm I think and a few crofters
There was I believe
I remember myself quite distinctly that there were a good many people about the places mentioned in the statement
I remember that there were seven or eight families not saying I am altogether correct but so far as I can remember
In the time of the late Lady Gordon
Yes
To Mr Joseph Gordon
Her son
There are two occupied by farmers and there is another in the proprietors hands and besides there is the home farm attached to the big house
I was seventeen when I left the district
They were fairly comfortable
So far as I know there were few of them went away of their own accord
It was altogether a matter of  must with the majority of those I know
It was not very suitable when they went there but they made it suitable
They didnt keep many sheep but they had five or six cows
I believe I did
Because when my father died my mother had to give up the land and cows and everything and after that she was dependent on what milk her neighbours would supply her with
I dont think so
I wish to give an explanation in regard to the statement that the whole of that estate is one large farm
The people wish to adhere to that statement because there is practically only one farm on the estate
Captain Shaw has the whole of that estate
There is not another farmer on it besides the crofters and the crofters have with very few exceptions the remnants and useless pieces such as Bunavullin and Barr which would be of no use or very little for any other purpose
I have not consulted the valuation roll
Yes and what I know myself
Yes I believe that
Perhaps Mr Smith the proprietor pays rent for a certain amount of the estate but then he cannot be called a farmer because he does not farm it himself
There is no resident farmer except one
I dont believe there were many people evicted from that estate
That estate has preserved the people who were on it originally better than any other
More so
No not particularly but I wish to state particularly that there is only one farmer on the estate
I did I knew him from hearing him preach in my young days
The district is all one parish
Nearly  per cent
Yes I have heard it stated and I have read it
I believe it is considered that
Certainly
When I come from Glasgow whenever I have a holiday I feel it very much to see bare walls where the people used to be in pretty comfortable circumstances and whom I remembered quite well myself
I know they have not stated it nearly so bad as it is
I am not aware of that
Yes  but I dont know whether any of the people were employed at that pier or not
There may or there may not I dont know
I cannot tell
It has been pretty much the same way ever since I remember
There have been no improvements except the pier itself so far as I see
Some of them have in other countries and perhaps in Glasgow and the south
They always get on as well I believe as people who came from any other district at any rate
No it is not
The estate of Glencrepisdale and Landal
Yes
Mr Newton
No but I am quite willing to answer any questions about it
Yes there is scarcely any person there but shepherds
Yes partly but there have been no evictions recently because there was nobody to evict
At one time certainly
The Stewarts I believe have been connected with this district for a long time
I think so
I dont think so I cannot see any signs of it
Yes
Yes they have been pretty well looked after they seem to be comfortable enough
I think I would be very much inclined to take the same view as they have taken themselves in the statement
More land certainly they have no land at all
Yes
Yes and so long as they conduct themselves in a proper manner
Yes I do
Yes in my opinion
I think there has been far too much emigration for this district at any rate
If there is much more emigration there will be no one left at all
When I come from Glasgow I shall have no place to go to
I believe for about twenty or twentyfive years
It may have beena little of itarable before that but I know when the people went there they had to do a great deal of work
It was never so far as I remember or so far as I have heard it stated in the hands of a large farmer until Mr MMaster got it
They went at the same time
By two or three I believe
But they had to reclaim the land themselves
I know the houses
That is all
I have heard it stated in evidence
To whomsoever the property they are in belongs
Yes
Yes  that was stated
I have no doubt some of them would  but whether they could all do so or not is a question
I am certain they could
They would be assisted by their families in Glasgow they are all in Glasgow
Certainly
Yes on reasonable rent with a reasonable security that they would not be turned out when they improved the place and that their rent would not be raised to any excessive extent
I think where land has been out of cultivation for fifteen years the rent should be less at first until the people got two or three crops out of it
probably one appointed by Government for the purpose or something of that kind
Yes
Yes
Yes  there are no houses now
I should say at the expense of the proprietor that is my opinion
Certainly the people may be charged as usual perhaps some interest for the money laid out along with their rent
I have no doubt in the case of a person being able to build that would be the best way but in the case of a man not being able to build I think it might be settled the other way very well
Yes charge a reasonable interest
I dont think any one would go against paying more rent if he got a good house
This place in which we are just now is very suitable perhaps for two or three miles it is about the best land in Argyll
I think if you go out and take a look through this place just now you will see some very good land and land suitable for crofters
I dont know I never was there
You are not mistaken my Lord
Yes I have read the statements
Yes
I dont know where they are
I could not say
There are one or two farmers on the estate I dont know what amount of ground they occupy
I know there are one or two
I dont know that
That may have been overlooked in the statement it is possible it may have been
I cannot say anything as to that
There are I believe altogether twentythree crofters on the estate
It is the only estate in this district that has in any way at all got a crofter population
These two or three places may have been overlooked in making out the statement but I dont know whether they are fairly valued or not
We have no wish that anything inaccurate should appear at all I have not so far as I am concerned
Yes
 Bunavullin
This township is also on the estate of Glenmorven under Beatties trustees
Our grievances are
At least forty years so far as I know
They were brought there at that time or a little previous and houses were built about that time
To Miss Stewart
Some of the people who came there were on the estate previously in another place
Previous to the time the people came there it was occupied as a large farm
We have just now all the hill pasture we had at the beginning
The people were sent there as labourers
So far as I know or recollect the crofts are just as they were at the beginning  they have not been subdivided
There are two cows and a calf and we have a horse among every three
I bought myself last winter  worth of feeding for my cattle
There may be some of the others who have bought more and there may be some who have bought less
Two cows and one follower
That includes all the fodder I have bought together
We go shares for the horse
One of us feeds the horse alternately when it is our turn but the horses are not generally housed  they are allowed to live outside
We feed them with our own corn so long as it lasts and after that we have to buy
The proprietor built the houses
They are slated houses
The houses were slated when built
No
The houses are reasonably large but there is only one room
There is only one apartment
The arrangement of the beds or how they are placed is left to ourselves but they are generally placed along the wall
Yes that is so
No  each family have one room to themselves
Yes
Yes a bed can be placed in the loft but we have to use the loft as a barn
It was intended for that
Yes all very much alike
The houses are from  feet to  feet each way
They have built no additions to the houses behind
They could not do that because the byres and places for the horses were built at the back
No
It is my opinion that the houses were built so near the sea that they might take up as little room as possible
It is occupied by a large farmer
No it is not occupied by the proprietor of the shooting lodge
Previously the land was mostly all arable and it can very easily be turned into arable land again
No doubt the land is perhaps very useful to the farmer because it is lying very near to the sea
On the side on which we are situated the farm goes from sea to seaone branch of the sea goes in at one side and the Sound of Mull goes in at the other side
On this side there is not much lowlying ground but there is plenty on the east side of the farm
It is my opinion that although that portion were taken from the farmer he would have sufficient ground
He has a very large farm and would have sufficient ground otherwise
I think we are paying dear enough with that land along with what we hold at present because we have not sufficient grazings for the cows
Not to any great extent
It depends very much on what sort of winter it is
One winter is perhaps less severe than another and if a winter is very severe we have to buy more
Last winter we had to give our cattle meal
About fifteen years
On Lady Gordons estateDrimnin
Yes
No
They were removed
Some are in Glasgow and some in other places on the adjoining estate of Ardnastaig
It is occupied by a large farmer
They were fairly well off
I cannot exactly tell the amount of the acreage
I kept five cows
We had no horses
We had a few sheep
The place was so very rough and the ground so soft that horses could not work on it
Yes that is the only place
Yes it is quite close beside usjust marching with our present crofts
Yes
Yes
As our crofts are so small we would convert what was convertible into arable land
I think we have plenty of stock already although we got the land
We would like to keep the two calves because we have the two cows
Yes we would like to have the followers along with the cows
Yes we do
Yes
Yes
Yes
No very little unless the adjoining farm will employ lads and lasses now and again
We just go and work wherever we can
Yes they sometimes get work on the adjoining estate and perhaps go home to their own house at night
Yes
Yes only we would expect to be better off
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
They pay their rent to the proprietor they have nothing to do with the tenant
John Stewart does not pay any rent if he does not pay the feu for the house
He is quite in a different condition from those I have spoken about so far as the arable land is concerned but his stock goes on our hill of which he is entitled to a share
We were removed from other portions of the estate but I am not a native and dont know
To the farmer
Yes
I wrote a portion of it myself
The rest of the statement was written by themselves
It is exhausted by overcropping
It has been continually cropped for the last eighty years
Yes
Yes
Only a calf and a stirk
We had one horse each fifty years ago but it was taken from us at that time
No
Yes
Yes it is to the farmer that we pay the rents
There is no special time but we are very thankful when we get the work
We must attend to the sheepshearing or cutting down brackens or any odd work about the farm
I think we would be allowed to get better work anywhere else
Yes
No
It is from the proprietor we would expect the better houses
I am not very sure but I think it is in the lease
Yes I am of opinion that he could not remove us but I cannot be sure
No there was no improvement made so far as I remember
There was nothing done at his expense
Yes we would
It is all done with the spade and we have to carry all the manure or seaware on our back
Yes we are pretty near the shore
There is plenty of seaware
Yes
I am not able to answer that question
I would rather not say anything about it as I am not sure
I dont live there
Yes
They came to my house and asked me specially to allow myself to be elected
Yes
There are four families
There were two came over as delegates from the others
Yes
Yes it is pretty large
It is about sixty years ago
Miss Stewart
Yes
I cannot exactly give the number of people but I know there were a good many
I know it because it was stated by people who were there and who were put out of it
Some of them got removed to another portion of the estate and others had to go away to other placesany place they could get with houses
So far as I know about twentysix all over the estate
Yes
Yes
Mr Smith is in it
Yes
Yes
No there are these
I come here on behalf of the people of Lochaline
Yes
Yes I agree with that
I cannot say anything at all in addition to what Dugald Macgregor has said about the estate of Sellar  but I am prepared to speak of this estate where we are just now
Yes since I was removed out of my own land
I was at a place called Knock a little above the church here
Seventeen years ago
I had a house and a croft and the fourth share in a horse and cow
No sheep
At first we paid a rent of  s but afterwards it was raised to 
There would be about twenty crofters
They were fairly well offplenty of potatoes and meal and milk
No
The late Mrs Campbell Paterson
It is about eighteen or nineteen years ago
From the late Mr Sinclair
He was there since I remember
Two years
I am not aware that they were a penny in arrears of rent
Because the proprietrix wished to have the land in her own hands
Yes
No
Some of the people built their own houses and when my people came to the place they went into a house which was built before
The house was built of dry stone and with a thatch roof
They were good houses of the kind  we did not object to them
The houses were all pulled down before we were three weeks out of them
There were no houses but we could go into the loch if we liked
Every one who was able to go away went away somewhere else to the south or other parts and those who were not able had to go to the village and hire houses or rooms there
Not a halfpenny
The wood of the houses was burned as firewood by the shepherds who came into the estate
A great many of the people went away altogether because they could not get houses here
No that was not required  the people went away quietly when they got notice to quit
Six or seven
They did not
We got no work
There was no work going on on the estate at the time
The people when they were removed had a little money which they had saved or which they got from their stock when they sold them and shortly after that they had just to go on to the parish and shortly after that they died
When I got a house for my family in the village here I went across to the island of Mull and worked there
Yes I reside here now and for the last fifteen years I have been working on Mr Smiths estate
 and I keep everything in repair myself
It is a thatched house and it has nearly tumbled down
Yes
There are some of the poor people who receive parochial aid who live in some of the houses and workpeople as well in some of them
From  to  s for one room
Yes
Yes
Over twenty
Yes
Some of them are pretty far behind
Those who are able to work are better off than those who are not
I cannot say what was in their minds at the time but it did very suddenly bring us to poverty
The township of Kill was cleared by Mr Sinclair before Mrs Paterson got the property
Yea
He did it of his own accord
Yes he went as far as possible to induce the proprietrix to let us remain in the placeto give us the arable land
Hardie I understand
She bought the estate
No not at the time the estate was bought
Yes
Yes
We are not sure as to who the proper heir is
Four or five years
I pay it to the trustees of Mrs Paterson
Yes  but that is not paid to the trustees it is paid to landlords who had built houses in the village
There are some living in one room who pay rent to the trustees but not such a high rent as that
Alexander Campbell Widow Angus Cameron and Widow Hugh Cameron
Yes I am perfectly sure of that because they live just beside me
I have nothing to say about any other property
I would be very glad to get it
I think it would be to my benefit alsothat is if I could get it at a reasonable rent
No there was scarcely anything doing until about a year ago when the new pier was commenced and the road leading across to it
There is no one living there just now except the proprietor and his servants
They have houses in the village of Lochaline and work for the proprietor
I was elected by the people of the village
Yes
They complain about the land having been taken from them and of their being put into this place
I speak for neither the one nor the other but they sent me to say that I myself was upon Ardtornish and was removed to Lochaline by process of law
I now occupy a small place and make my living as I can working anywhere
I came to speak for myself
I dont wish to say much altogether but I am willing to answer any questions that may be asked
Forty years
Sheriff Gregorson
A croft and a cow
I was removed altogether when the property was sold
Yes
Sheriff Gregorsons father had it before Sheriff Gregorson
It was Sheriff Gregorson
Patrick Sellar
I got the notice of removal from Sheriff Gregorson at the time when Sellar bought the estate so that the estate was to be cleared for Mr Sellar when he came in
On the estate of Lochaline
I was a weaver to trade and I was working at my trade and the croft at the same time
For the last thirty years I have been working as a labourer for Mr Smith the proprietor of Ardtornish
Yes when the people went away the loom ceased
I get s d a day as a labourer but I have now ceased to workthis year
I have not asked the proprietor for a cows grass
I buy milk
I could get as much produce off my croft as would very nearly keep my family
Both together
I could get two bolls of meal off the seed of the croft and I planted four bolls of potatoes
 a year
Yes but not on this property it was over in Mull
No my family was here on this side
At the time I was removed I was not married
I would like to be the way I was before if it were possible that is I should like to have a croft and my cows back again as before
I do not live on Mr Smiths property now
I had a house from him so long as I was in his employment but not being in his employment I have had to get a house on the Lochaline estate
I was removed from the house when I ceased to work
The father bought the estate and the son sold it
He was the sheriff in this district he was not a lawyer in Oban  his nephew was a lawyer at Oban
I cannot tell the number just now
About forty years ago when the sheep farming craze was at its height some families were removed from the townships of Aulistau and Carrick on Lady Gordons estate as their places were to be added to the adjoining sheep farm
The people were removed on to the most barren spot on the whole estate where there was no road or any possibility of making one
They had to carry all manure and seaware on their backs as the place was so rocky that a horse would be of no use
Notwithstanding all these disadvantages they contrived through time to improve the place very much by draining and reclaiming mossy patches and by carrying soil to be placed on rocky places where there was no soil
During the twentyfive years they occupied this place their rents were raised twice
Latterly with the full confidence of their tenure being secure they built better houses at their own expense and two or three years afterwards they were turned out of their holdings on the usual six weeks notice without a farthing of compensation for land reclaimed
In justice to the present proprietor Joseph Gordon Esq we wish to state our conviction that such an injustice would not have been permitted on the estate since he came into possession as we regard him as a kind and considerate landlord to the few crofters on his estate
It has often been advanced by landlords factors and others that the Highland crofters are lazy and do not improve their holdings  but where is the inducement to improvements under such circumstances as we have here related and as the Commissioners are well aware that this case is not a solitary instance as it is quite common in every district throughout the Highlands that if a crofter improves his holding he has to pay for it by having his rent raised or his holding being given to the first man who offers more rent on account of such improvements
I heard it read before
Acharn belongs to Mr Smith
Sheriff Gregorson sold the whole estate of Acharn and Ardtornish to Mr Patrick Sellar
That is so
Yes
Acharn was bought by Mr Sellar the people and fee could not agree about the leases and on that account they were removed
At that time Ardtornish was in the hands of Sheriff Gregorson and there were not many crofters on it
I was on the estate of Ardtornish
Mr Sellar evicted the tenants of Acharn himself after becoming proprietor of the estate
There were only four crofters on the estate of Ardtornish and the remainder on Acharn
Sheriff Gregorson removed four from Ardtornish
That is so two or three years before that
Some of them were removed south to Glasgow and the large cities a few of them got shelter here on the Lochaline estate and the rest went wherever they could get a place to go to
There were a few poor cottars who remained upon the estate but the rest were evicted because they had no means of removing anywhere
There is just one croft on the estate at present
He is not living but his son is in possession of the estate just now
One of them is married to Mr Smiths daughter
Yes it is my opinion that he is
Yes they were very well off at the time
I cannot answer that it was in possession of the Gregorsons for as long as I remember
I believe the larger portion of the property previous to Sheriff Gregorson having it belonged to the Duke of Argyll
No there is only the one Acharn in the district
I never heard of another place in the country called Acharn
No I never heard of any Stewart being in this Acharn
I have been residing here on this side of Lochaline estate since I was removed from the croft I held on the Ardtornish side
When I remember first there were only four small houses in the village below here
There is plenty of land lying waste if Mr Smith or the other proprietors were willing to give it
No  there were not many of these residing on the Smith estate the larger portion of them were on the estate of the late Mrs Paterson
It is called Lochaline estate
It belongs to Mrs Patersons estate
It is up about three miles from here at a place called Kinlochaline
That is so
That is so
There was no one appointed specially for these districts because there is no one residing there the people who were there are residing in the village here
I dont wish to take anything to do with these questions at all as there is another delegate appointed to speak about them
Alexander Cameron
No
It is in the hands of the proprietor and stocked with sheep and deer and cattle
No with the exception of one crofter
Yes
He pays   rent I understand
Yes that is the only one I know of
William Murray
I wish merely to make a few remarks on the document that was prepared by Mr MCallum with reference to my estate
I wish to point out a few inaccuracies in his statement
The grazing of the hill which has been reduced still contains  acres of good grazing land I believe about the best grazing land that I have and I am told by competent authorities that it is capable of grazing  cattle
There are only at present upon it ninetyseven cattle paying a rent of s per head six horses paying s and two horses which are free
We allow the owners of these two horses as a privilege to graze on the hill for nothing
Since I came into possession of the Aros estate the crofts have not decreased in any way but have increased
The only farm that was in the vicinity of Tobermory and which was suitable for conversion into crofts I converted into crofts and the rents of the crofts remain unaltered since the day I came too fitful
The cottages which were referred to which I built and which are said to contain only two rooms contain mostly four rooms  a few contain three but on an average they contain four rooms each
For these cottages and a quarter of an acre of land at least they pay   a year
The cottages cost me from  to  each
A statement was made that the grazing is given to all and sundry but that is a mistake
There is a ground officer whose business it is to see that no cattle graze on the hill except those which are allowed and that the grazing is given to those who according to the finding of the Court have undoubted right to it and also to those who rent crofts
There are fifty crofts on the estate of which fortythree are rented at over   and seven at   and under
There were some remarks made as to a piece of my farm being given over to rabbits
The whole extent of the ground is only  acres and it is entirely surrounded by a rabbitproof wire netting a fence so high that the rabbits cannot climb over it and so close that they cannot go through it and therefore the rabbits can inconvenience no one that farm is in my own lands against my will
These are all the remarks I have to make but if your Lordship or any of the Commissioners wish to ask any questions I shall be glad to answer them as far as I can
There are only eleven I think or twelve but I cannot very well describe them
I think they are  but the right goes not with the party but with the house and as the house changes hands the right goes with it
No I dont think they can be said to belong to a very poor class
Oh
no
Those who rent crofts have a right to graze say some one and some two cows
I may mention that according to the original charter that was granted by the Fisheries Society the right was only from Whitsunday to Martinmas but I allow them to graze if they choose the whole year round
It was supposed to lie idle I imagine
Yes
Upon this ground
I should imagine they would pay   or    but I dont know much about farming and cannot say
They have in connection with their houses
Those persons who rent crofts
At the same price
On one occasion I think we allowed one or two widows to graze but I dont think that is the case now
None unless they rent land
Any one who rents a croft has a right to the grazing of a cow
I should not say there are very many
The crofts are rented mostly by all and sundry some are labourers others artizans and some shepherds a croft is not a means of livelihood but a means of producing luxury a means of producing extra comforts for the family
My father purchased it but he died within ten days after the purchase
Not all I took in a piece at Loch Manial a piece of good arable land which I am at present cropping
I cannot say  I have not had it marked so as to see properly
Nearer a hundred than ten
No it forms part of Drumfin which was let until last year but I have it at present in my own hands
It was a portion of the hill grazing I think there were no crofts on it It was rather far away from Tobermory for crofts
There is no suitable land for making crofts round about Tobermory all the suitable land is given in crofts
But I made an offer some years ago which is still open to allow any one who wished to take in a piece of the hill and I offered to supply draining and fencing materials and give the land on a term of years at a nominal rent but no one has accepted the offer
A portion of the hill that is used for grazing  but which practically cannot be grazed as it is mostly cut up into peat mosses
They have been increased largely
That is so
The whole of a farm
The addition was made within twelvemonths after my arrival so that I remember very little about it
I should think it was mostly arable ground with possibly a few sheep
No they live in Tobermory
Yes
As nearly as I can judge the rent I get from those crofts amouuts to  more than the farm paid but that  goes to meet the cost of the subdivision
I have certain expenses to go into
Every now and then one crofter or so falls into arrear but I may say the rent is very well paid
They are mostly fourroomed cottages
There is only one tworoom cottage and it is given to two widows who pay no rent at all
Yes some more or less
Not a very great demand for houses at    I have one or two let at a small rentI think one at and there is more demand for the cheap ones
They are smaller
About three years I should think
Yes except one block of four cottages that have a good deal more land attached to them and after the water was brought in and various improvements made I think the rent was raised to 
A portion is borne by the proprietor and a portion by the tenant
Not very much
There is not a great demand for   cottages just now
I have one standing vacant
Oh
yes
No there were some on the place that I enclosed
Mostly for the purpose of profit
Yes
I only commenced it six months ago and I am not able to judge yet
I dont think the crofting population could have been any greater than it is just now
Over on the banks of Loch Forsa I believe there were crofts and there are none now  that is on the extremity of the estate there are traces of crofts on the hillhere and there an old house
Yes
The expense would be very great
I tried the experiment in one case
I had a farm which drew  a year in rent and I subdivided it into two farms at a cost of  and now the two farms combined only draw  one  and the other  The combined rent now is  while the previous rent before the expenditure of  was 
It would have been reduced undoubtedly
I question if a family could live with any degree of comfort upon such a small piece and the expenditure on the subdivision fence and houses that would require to be built would be very great
There are a good many houses in Tobermory which pay feuduties of about that amount
Those eleven may be amongst them but there are others besides the eleven
I should not think quite  more like  I should imagine
One cow each I believe
Yes
Yes but it is actually used for grazing
I should say from three to five acres
Twentyfive shillings on an average for the best land
They have grazing for a cow for s in one or two cases they had the privilege of grazing two cows at s each
Not as a rule  it is not asked
Houses can be built at various prices
I find it almost impossible to build suitable houses under 
Yes if the proprietor had built a house for them
Exactly
I would not have wished to do it if it had involved building houses on the crofts bceanse the crofts are so small that a family could not exist in comfort simply from the produce of the croft they require other occupation besides
All
I dont know of one instance of a crofter on my estate who trusts to the croft as a means of livelihood
Labourers joiners masons and some of them shopkeepers
There are very few fishermen here one or two
One or two do go as yachtsmen in summer and I think there are a few sailors
I believe it is eleven
It was originally seventeen but they have dwindled down and I think eleven is about it
The house has
Fifty altogether fortythree and seven
I cannot say
Possibly some of them may rent a croft
I think they are on the land  so far as I know about the boundaries of the British Fisheries Societys land I believe they are on it
No doubt of it if the number was multiplied to too great an extent
I believe I am bound to give the eleven the grazing of a cow
I believe there is pasture for almost double that number
I am told the animals are uncommonly fat and in good condition on that grazing
The grass is very good
They have all gone
Yes two of them
They asked to be allowed to go because they said they could not pay the rent
Yes
No
The tenants have the right to burn I think onetenth only according to the lease
I wish that no more should be burned and I wish that no more should be burned iu one special place than is arranged by the lease
My desire is that the young heather should not be burned but that the old heather should and I believe my wish would agree with a good farmers idea of proper burning
I have seen it done iu person and my gamekeeper is always there
That would depend to a great extent on the amount that seemed to require burning
If there was a large amount of thick heather requiring burning I would  but if it was young heather I should think it advisable not to burn it
I believe the lease says onetenth
I dont think that it would be a right thing to do it would not be advantageous I believe
I dont think so
Only one
No the clause was put into the lease as in previous leases  personally I know nothing about whether it was a right thing to do
I believe it was a customary clause
Precisely
I cannot understand it
I know of no district of Scotland where the people are quite satisfied
I have done my best to please my tenants and I am not aware of any dissatisfaction no complaints are ever made to me
Ten months out of twelve
Yes
Not as regards the other people
Their claim goes with the croft and any year it might be taken away or the rate might be increased if I chose
Most unquestionably
It goes along with the croft and it is of value to the croft seeing that the grazing of a cow is worth more than s
It is
It is the late Mr Forsyth I refer to
As far as I know from Dunach
The laird of Coll
Every person was
It was my father who was in it then
A little above 
I cannot be sure
 s
Yes very heavy
Thirteen
Some left and others became poor and left the place
No
It is divided about
The most of it is given over to large farmers or to larger farms and the present crofters have a little of it but none of the hill
We have part of the crofts
The laird has got a part of the crofts that were in possession of the party who left and the manse has got a part of them and the crofters have a part and the industrial school has a part
It was ground that was allotted for the people of Dervaig to put one cow upon it
The rent was not reduced
Good land we were all pleased with it
Quite close
When he took it into his own hand he promised we would get it back in three years and that the land would be much more improved than the way we had it
There was no mention made of that  we all understood we were to get it back as we had it before with the crofts
It was far better as it was while we had it at first than with the improvements as some of the ground has not as yet yielded any grass
The ground was spoilt
Yes it was a common for the horses
Certainly we were
No but we had no other market at the time  we had no place to put them when the hill was taken from us
Duncan Livingstone
Mr Blair
He is dead
At Salen
There was not such a day since then until now with thunder and lightning and rain
Some of them gave up their holdings at that time and some of them remained as they were
There are not poorer people in Argyleshire
Yes all the world knows that
Yes
Yes
The crofters of Tobermory
Plenty
No only the charter of the British Fishery Society
I told the people at the time that they had nothing to say here only what I had to say myself in reference to my croft
Yes I have nothing to do with any person but myself
I was apprehended and put into prison when I stood for a croft after having it manured in the spring time
I was detained in prison for ten days and the croft was ploughed ready for sowing when I was liberated
As I believe I had a right to the croft as long as I could pay for it
Mr Nairnes
It was by Sheriff Robertsons order
I was on a certain occasion going up to my croft and found a party there engaged in ploughing it
I took hold of the reins that were leading the horses and took the horses away with me out by the side of the gate that led to the croft
I asked the parties who ordered them to go into my croft and they told me it was Mrs Petrie the old innkeeper here
I am not sure but  think it was about thirtyseven years ago
I am blaming the sheriff entirely for my being committed
Two days after this occurrence Mr Nairne the then proprietor sent two horses and his own ploughman down to plough my croft
I did direct from Edinburgh
I believe I had a right to hold on to the croft as long as I could pay for it
My charter
Plenty people were asking me to proceed direct to Edinburgh to lodge my claim with the lawyers
I am glad that you did come to make your acquaintance
Nothing further than that if the crofts are restored to the people good and well and if not I have my cows grass
It was that party who built the house
I bought it
Yes it was to be renewed then
I never got it back again
I would get a croft from Mr Nairne if I would sign a paper referring to certain rules and regulations
I preferred that
Yes it is known that there were
There are very few upon the old standing there are only two in Tobermory at present of the old standing
One hundred and twentyseven
Only two in possession of crofts
Only two in the original holding
Yes Ardmore Penalbanach Lathern Sorn and Ballochrayall these farms were occupied by crofters
I think that Sorn was allotted to four crofters
There were three or four on the farm called Lathern on the Mishnish estate and there were eight in Ardmore
No none
They were well off with Mr Stewartin very good circumstances
The late factor
Some came to Tobermory some went to Glasgow and some to America and all parts
Some of them are at present in Tobermory
John Stewart he owned all the land beyond Ardmore in that directionall to the march of Quinish
Five miles
Only in the places I have mentioned
Yes
Yes
Statement by John MCallum Solicitor Tobermory
The estate of Tobermory formerly the settlement of the Society for Extending the Fisheries and improving the Sea Coasts of the Kingdom was commenced and established in  and sold by the Society in  to David Nairne Esq
Of Drumkelbo who purchased it and the estate of Aros at about   and by him in  at the same price to Alexander Crawford Esq of Aros and by his heirs in  at the same price to Farquhar Campbell Esq of Aros  and by him in  to Alexander Allan Esq of Aros the present proprietor at  The estate of Aros belonging originally to the late Hugh MLean Esq of Coll marched with Tobermory and he was the first landlord that coveted the privileges of the settlers by getting the Societys factor to advise them to sell him a large portion of the hill grazing to add to his domain of Drumfin modernly called Aros House valued at the grazing of twelve cows for which he agreed to pay  a year to the Society
This was done against the remonstrance and resistance of the settlers who turned off the men who were sent to form the marches of this acquisition
The estate was laid out and planned by the Society to accommodate sixty settlers who came and settled there from the adjoining district with from eight to twelve acres of reclaimable land for crops at from s to s d per acre the grazing of two cows on the hill or moor at s each and a horse at s with building ground in the village for dwelling house and offices at d per foot of frontage in lower village and Id or d per foot in upper village and back garden and right to cut peat in the mosses at s d per year as the copy printed regulations produced will instruct
I can lay one of these printed regulations before the Commissioners
About the year  the most of all the lots were taken up and a number of additional parties wishing to settle there the Society against the advice of their factor Mr Maxwellinstead of taking lots for these off the hill taking advantage of the clause in the lease reservingto the Society the right of subdividingresolved on dividing the existing crofts into two
At this time the Society owned the island of Calve covering the harbour of Tobermory and was given out in crofts to the settlers the latter having right to cut the seaware thereon for s d annually but Mr  Lean of Coll the proprietor then of the Aros estate also acquired the island from the Society and let it to one tenant for  yearly
The rent now is  yearly
Till about the year  they had one hundred and twenty crofts in Tobermory with the privileges in the hill subdivided also and when more settlers applied after  the agents were instructed to leave the settlement intact and grant no more lots to settlers
Shortly after the Society sold the estate in  Mr Nairne the purchaser sold his highly improved estate of Drumkelbo in Forfarshire aud bought Aros and Tobermory to try his agricultural experiments on them
The price had to be borrowed as the heir to the purchaser of Drumkelbo disputed
The purchaser did not pay and they entered in litigation in the House of Lords brought down a civil engineer of the name of Blackadder to value the crops instead of a valuator acquainted with the usages of the country and value of its land for grazing c
He raised the rent of the croft lands from s to s d per acre to s and upwards per acre  and of the croft land of about ten acres held by me for  s to  s of rent
Mr Nairne besides stipulated that I should pay the  per cent payable by him to Government in payment of capital interest in twenty one years I considered it rather hard that I should have to submit I had an affection for the croft I am a crofters son and I was a crofter and my heart was in it  and from affection I was induced to adhere to it alleging that the more rent crofters were made to pay the better they would work and as the settlers held on leases of thirty years or a life rent which had expired they were advised that the law would not protect them in possession at the old rent
Though it was a hopeless undertaking some of them remained and submitted but the most of them had to quit in consequence of the exorbitant rents the croft lands which had been reclaimed off the hill and brought into cultivation and fenced and dyked by themselves without any compensation the dykes being still standing
Mr Nairne attempted to meddle with their grazing on the hill or common but this privilege being in connection with their tacks of their building ground of ninety nine years renewable for ever on payment of a years rent the settlers turned their cows on to the hill when he drove them off and latterly he desisted from interfering with them
He however fenced that portion of the hill and moss below the public road lying between the croft land and the old lodge which he used for his own purposes and attempted to erect a sod dyke round a portion of the hill next the Baliscate crofts
There is a clause which had a great effect in the action a clause of reservation to the Societythat is that in certain events they would be allowed to take the hill for certain purposes that is improvement
We considered that and I think every unprejudiced person considered it would be impossible for a locality such as this which has now become an important town  but instead of that we were quite disappointed in our action before their Lordships in the Court of Session
Their Lordships believed that if a man merely put a fence round a portion of a hill for sheep that was an improvement
We did not consider that an improvement
Sheep were not contemplated when these regulations were made  and we were disappointed with ourselves and the Court of Session  and now we are before your Lordship and the Commissioners
But a settler of the name of Peggy Macdougall succeeded in getting the workmen to cease the erection
He also evicted crofters at Scribruadh near the Poors House and converted these into a farm for his friend a Forfarshire innkeeper of the name of Mr Petrie to whom he let the Mull Hotel here
There were perhaps about twenty crofters evicted to accommodate this lady who was a favourite
When the estate was sold to Mr Crawford in  this gentleman considered that the settlers had as good a right to their croft lands and grazings fee as he had himself and indeed granted feu rights to some of them with these privileges  and if all the settlers had been properly alive to their interests they should have taken titles from him
Mr Crawford allowed  per cent down of the rent assessed by Mr Nairne and his engineer Blackadder
Captain Hugh MLean and one Duncan Cameron were the only two who availed themselves of Mr Crawfords lenient proprietorship
Captain Campbell in  became the purchaser and carried on the letting as left by Mr Crawford only he was advised as he told a committee of the settlers who waited upon him as to the hill grazing that he had the best legal advice in Scotland and England that he had a legal right to the hill grazings and that he would act up to that advice and the settlers should act up to theirs and at the close of the interview the agent for the settlers expressed regret that he and his clients had to fight but hoped they would be able to fight as civilly as they could
They were immediately served with sheriff summonses of removing which were successfully defended on the plea of want of jurisdiction the pursuer having been found liable in expenses
Then came a declarator and interdict against all the settlers numbering upwards of one hundred and twenty defenders termed  an army of martyrs  by their Edinburgh counsel to have it declared that the lands of Tobermory and Baliscate were the property of the pursuer so far as the defenders could not instruct a valid title to the same the conclusions of which were latterly restricted to the question of cows grazing on the muir or common and the right to cut peat in the mosses
I can produce the documents in the action if desired
The defenders the most of whom had no written title having by reference to the regulations and rental of accounts and descriptive rentals of the Society with the Act H cap
 Precious Act
Well I think I was quite right
I did not look upon her either as a man or as a woman  but she was a favourite in my opinion
I took every care I could and I hope your Lordship will sympathise with me because I was conducting this law plea twelve years and cannot help having some feeling
But I think landlords are public persons and I am
I should be sorry to give your Lordship the trouble I will read it myself
 The defenders the most of whom had no written title having by reference to the regulations and rental of accounts and descriptive rentals of the Society with the Act  cap  made out a valid right of lease to their building lots and privilege of cows grazing and peat cutting before the Inner House of the Court of Session with expenses on an appeal from the Lord Ordinary who decided against them
Captain Campbell appealed to the House of Lords but their Lordships affirmed the decision of the Court of Session with expenses
The settlers then thought that they would have been allowed to possess their grazing and cut their peats in peace but they were mistaken and they were obliged to raise an action of declarator and interdict against Captain Campbell to enable them to exercise these privileges
Their agent selected a representative pursuer Donald Gillies but shortly after the action was instituted Captain Campbells local agents influenced Gillies to withdraw from the action
The settlers agent got him to agree to repudiate this withdrawal but Captain Campbells agents got over him the second time and the action was latterly prosecuted by a man of the name of Angus Henderson settler in Tobermory a seaman
The words of the tack are Moreover the said and his foresaid shall have a right by his tack to pasture one cow during the summer months season viz from the th day of May to the th day of November inclusive yearly on such parts of the said Societys muirlands as shall not be set off in lots for cultivation or enclosed and improved from time to time subject to the power reserved by the Society in their minutes of the nd day of November  for enclosing and improving the muir ground and taking away the summers grazing for cows in the events therein mentioned
Captain Campbell the proprietor had commenced and did enclose with a wire fence the best portion of the hill for sheep grazing while the question was sub judice
This ground lies on this side of Lochnamian which he afterwards drained of its waters where the cows on common went to in the heat of the summer days
He further attempted to dyke and enclose the upper portion of the hill where the settlers were in the habit of grazing their sixty horses but having been interdicted he did not proceed any distance with the dyke and the Court of Session having interpreted the improving the muir to mean the fencing of it off for sheep grazing as Captain Campbell had done and not the letting of it as agricultural lots to additional settlers as the settlers construed it and as the Society undoubtedly intended it he was allowed so to fence off portions of it  and his successor Mr Allan in the first year of his possession finished and completed the dyke
Captain Campbell had commenced round the horse grazing and added it to his neighbouring farm of Lettermore and added a greater portion of the  hill to that fenced off by Captain Campbell till the extent of grazing in the hill for the settlers at s per cow is reduced to a mere nothing and is indeed valueless and let to all and sundry
The settlers are also deprived of their peats and merely allowed to cut these at inconvenient places wherever the landlord or his factor or manager or ground officer chooses to point out and on this reduced portion of hill upwards of  cows graze
After the action was decided in the House of Lords some of the settlers against the advice of their agent assembled and broke down the fences around the ground taking off their grazing on the hill by Captain Campbell
They were wrong in taking the law into their own hands and on the evidence of the police officer before the sheriff substitute they principally women were convicted of rioting though they did no rioting unless the rejoicing over the fall of the fences and the freedom to their cattle could be called rioting and sentenced to ten days imprisonment
It must however not be forgotten that the offending settlers did not get the benefit of the fact that Captain Campbell had no right to erect these fencesparticularly while the question was sub judiceand that it was an industrial settlement that was contemplated by the Society in their minute and not a sheep walk the adaptation of Highland lands thereto and for deer and high rents having been of recent discovery or occurrence
The letting has since the Society sold till today been in a most dilapidated state
During Captain Campbells reign there was only one feu granted in the village and another for a combination poorhouse of about two acres for  yearly the pastoral not mentioning its agricultural value of which in a most secluded remote and damp locality would not be more than Is d or s d an acre and for a court house on the top of a hill in the outskirts of the town instead of being built in the centre of the lower village where the new Free Church has been transferred to by Mr Allan the present proprietor from its former site in Mr Caldwells lands
The croft land is now let to  Tom Dick and Harry at the exorbitant rent of s and s an acre and upwards in numerous instances being light Highland soil not worth more at best than from s to s per acre
What was very remarkable as to the original settlers in Tobermory was that from their having a small stake in the country as householders or proprietors none of them have become chargeable to the Parochial Board as paupers though one or two of them in late years have had to submit as they were deprived of there privileges while there has been since the passing of the recent Poor Law Act a great influx of poor disabled cottars and others who were evicted from the neighbouring lands of Mull Ulva c that  has tended to press hard on the original settlers and the Poor Law Boards
Previous to  and the failure of the potato crop and consequent introduction of the poorest of the country cottar population Tobermory was a valuable nursery for seamen
Some of the houses of these original settlers having become almost valueless from having been stripped of their other privileges are being bought up by the proprietor rebuilt in cottages of two rooms and let at a rent of  per annumrather a heavy rent when the poor road police burgh and water rates are added thereto or sold under a feu of s per foot of frontage for the lot that only paid formerly Id per foot of  feet frontage or s d yearly
The first sale of property made by the present proprietor Mr Allan was the smithy and smiths house both of one story at Ledaig with the bare ground on which it is builta single house or run about  feet long to the sister of the then smith since deceased who wished to secure it for her brother the other smith and who according to the landlords own purchase had to pay for her whistle and affection for her fathers bothy in the shape of  for the building not worth more than the half or third of that sum and s per foot of  feet frontage or more amounting to  or upwards of feuduty for the ground
Should feuing and letting proceed at this rate the fanciful price of  may be recouped but how this rate of feu is fairly to be paid is more than can be seen at present in a place without any trade or industry whatever except a distilleryif that can be called an industry
This proprietor with the assistance of our police commissioners of whom ho is chief is constructing or has constructed an extensive water and drainage scheme without even consulting or getting the consent of the ratepayers at a cost of from  to  if not  fully more than the original price of his estate of Tobermory altogether with a view to make it a resort for summer tourists or others in search of health from our centres of population but how far this may succeed is quite problematical
One thing that will be accomplished by the drainage scheme is that the soil from it will find its way to the only bathing ground we have if it does not return to the village again while there was not a better drained place than Tobermory before with a superabundant supply of the finest spring water from innumerable springs if these drains and springs were kept properly
Several of these wells used by the inhabitants have had their waters sunk into the new drainage pipes
Tobermory derives its name of Tobarmhuire from a mineral well superstitiously termed  St Marys Well
The north side of the village of Tobermory is built on the estate of Mishnish formerly belonging to Colonel Donald Campbell who feued the portion next the shore of it at s per foot of frontage with croft land in about sixty lots of about two acres each on the finest plot of arable land in Mull with the privilege of cows grazing on the hill for  yearly rent aud right of cutting peat
Three or four of these were in  feued to Mr Nisbet the factor procuratorfiscal bank agent c for his house and other two for land connected therewith
Mr Nisbet was also factor for the Tobermory estate forming the settlement of the Society and the north portion of these crofts was in or about the year  to the extent of about twenty crofts taken from the householders and crofters and added to the farm of Erray then rented by the deceased William Robertson Esq sheriff substitute of the northern district of Argyllshire and residing there for a year by rent of  what the crofters paid  each for or  per year
These crofters were then also all deprived of the hill grazing which was let to a flesher in town and is now added also to the farm of Erray along with the farms of Ardmore and Reraig
Reraig formerly let to nine tenants in three crofts three in each croft with the hill in common with six cows each twentyfive sheep and a horse at  s rent each or  s yearly in all Ardmore to eight tenants in two portions four tenants in each portion at  yearly rent reduced by Mr Caldwell to stock six cows twenty sheep and one horse each the hill in common
Other four of the remaining crofts were rented by Mr Sproat writer then clerk to Mr Nisbet the factor c and now also his successor in the offices of factor solicitor procuratorfiscal bank agent clerk and treasurer to the road trustees secretary to the Tobermory Combination Poorhouse c and on part of one of which he has feued and built a dwelling house offices and garden
Mr A
MDonald feus a croft and Mr MLachlan Badenoch another
The croft rents now without the hill grazing is reduced to  The farm of Erray enlarged as stated was after Mr Robertsons death let at a higher rent to Mr MLachlan Mingary Ardnamurchan along with the farms of Ardmore and Reraig at  yearly and when Mr MLachlan gave it up in  it fell into the proprietors hands like many of the lands in Mull at present and it has been let this year to Mr MKill the tenant of the Tobermory distillery at the reduced rent of  who has taken upon himself whether with the proprietors consent we cannot say to not only place a gate on the walk to Rhunagaul lighthouse made for the inhabitants but also to put up a card prohibiting dogs and shutting up every other road and access to his lands or their shores which were formerly used and walked upon by the inhabitants and strangers resorting to the place without let or hindrance and certainly without any injury to these or to the stock and cropping thereon or detriment to the owners  and we have no doubt Mr MKill in his great anxiety for the protection and security of his letting it would have these equally as well protected if he had allowed these to be used as they were as parties will get access to the shore through his lands in spite of all his barriers
The inhabitants of Tobermory are thus hemmed in on all sides like a city besieged while if they had retained their crofts so far as not required for feuing they would have been as they were at one time a healthy and happy community and would not only pay three times more rent to the proprietor but be able to take from the ground double what the large holders will ever be able to take
If the proprietors expect parties to feu their ground or to get the place to become a resort for strangers they can scarcely expect this unless these strangers if not the inhabitants are trusted to use these roads and walks
The ground on the top is offered for feuiug at the rate of   per acre and   the half acrevery handsome for such a sequestered spot in Mulland though the village has been made a police burgh under the Lindsay Act a few years since we were amused if not annoyed to observe in one of the charters granted of recent feus a whole regiment of regulations for keeping the roads free of obstructions and sundry other police regulations and provisions
While the proprietor seems to overlook the burgh commissioners are now in full authority to look after the town which has since their appointment been in a most disgraceful state the contractors for buildings being allowed to use the streets and roads as they choose with whole streets torn up from end to end for receiving the pipes for the works to the great inconvenience of the inhabitants while they should have been restricted to certain portions and to have these closed up as they proceeded
There is another very objectionable clause as to what is termed casualties in the feuing though this is by a recent Act declared to be unlawful a clause binding the feuar on the entry of heirs and singular successors for one year to the payment of double the above not inconsiderate feu duty  while the other proprietor has according to the Act an obligation to pay a certain defined sum in addition to the said feuduty at the expiry of every fixed period of fifteen or twenty years
The object of this we cannot see but likely our Edinburgh lawyers will be able to enlighten us not regarding the utility but probably the absurdity of the clause
Is not the yearly feuduty in all conscience quite sufficient and what superior office does the superior discharge for his consideration or equivalent that he gives for it
Merely I believe that he has the privilege of collecting this with his feus and rents
I need not remark that while all lands and heritages are now liable to be assessed for public burdens payable equally by landlord and tenant though formerly paid principally by the landlord yet feu duties on the rather peculiar plea that they are not property or its fruits are not so assessed
Then if they are not property or the fruits of property it would  be interesting to know what they are
Certainly they are no myth though the value to the feuars is very questionable
There is also a superiority payable out of the lands of Buliscate part of Mr Allans estate of Tobermory of   to Mr Caldwell of Mishnish as singular successor to the late Colonel Donald Campbell and   to the Duke of Argyll out of the lands of Tobermory besides a years rent of certain of these lands at the entry of an heir or singular successor to these superiors which is exacted
I had not time to make my statement as full as I could have wished but I endeavoured to make it as much to the point as possible
Yes
At a public meeting
By me
By myself
I have not the least doubt they are all aware of it
I believe the settlers of Tobermory are all aware of this statement and I challenge them to contradict it
I think it a fair and natural expression of their views particularly the Societys settlers
There was very little time for anybody to sign it but I may mention that I was agent for twelve years in this matter and was confided in by these settlers and naturally I ought to know their minds very well
It was a very arduous undertaking
Their houses
I stated that they have been able to make out a title to their houses
If they had not been able to do that the conclusion of Captain Campbells summons would have taken them away entirely
A great many of them had not written titles
A great many strangers now occupy these lands as many as of original settlers
All I can say they hold any right to is merely the houses they built
I cannot exactly tell
Not so many crofters but  stances are there still
But they can make very little of the houses when they are deprived of their crofts
I cannot exactly say how many
Probably sixty crofters but then you must take along with that that they have these settlements still
I was going to produce to your Lordship the regulations
I beg your Lordships pardon  there may be  of them or their successors in these houses  the houses are there to speak for themselves
Mr Allan has built additional houses to the original  and he has knocked down a few of them
I dont know what class
I should say adapted to the crofting class of people
They are sensible enough housescottages of two rooms and perhaps a midcloset
Yes at the increased rent I stated
Under the Society in the upper village it was a penny a foot for the back feus and twopence a foot for the front feus that would be about s d at a penny a foot and s at twopence a foot in the front street
I stated that there were thirty feet of frontage
For the building stance
s d in the back part and on the front street twopence a foot or s a stance
There might be a little difference in the length of frontage but it would be very immaterial
The size when there were only sixty settlers was about nine or ten or twelve acresthat is before the subdivision took place
I have my croft undivided but those that have divided crofts will have two or three or four acres
I was unwilling to take land but I was obliged to take it for my horses because the horses grazing was taken away
I suppose about the same as myself and I pay  for the croftfor the privilege of two cows on the hill which I make no use of for this reason that there is no grass on the hill
He would pay at least  an acre and in some instances s an acre
I know a croft that has gone as high as   an acre
I know a croft which is only two acres which is rented at  and my croft is s an acre
Yes
The way I form an idea of that is by the grazing of the horses the grazing of about  horses equal to  cows was taken off by the dyke Mr Allan finished
I would say it cannot be more than a fourth of the original hill at any rate
I never counted the acres
I believe there are one hundred cattle at least and about I believe eight or nine horses
I believe it is indiscriminate  everybody puts them on as he pleases
There has been no respect paid to any householder because if there was any preference given I should have got my fathers croft and I did not get it
It is to the prejudice of the original settlers
I believe they take advantage of the letting as well as the rest
I have statedthat I have grazing and two cows in connection with my croft but not in connection with my house
Well unless your Lordship calls me a man of a superior class I dont suppose they do
I believe some of them do but I cannot really say
Yes keenly and intensely
I have nothing further to remark only seeing I have been entrusted with this case since I came here I may say that I am acquainted with the phases of the working of these lands and that I might probably give an opinion as to what the remedy should be
I must say I feel a good deal of diffidence in giving an opinion because it is a very important question but at the same time I have found during my experience that if we had had valuation of rents by competent judges during the proprietorship of Mr Nairne and Captain Campbell the law plea would have been avoided
 Opinion as to Remedy as between Landlord and Tenant  Valuation of rents by competent judges
I would suggest if it were practicablebut the landlord will interfere likelya return to the old settlement as one of the most practical settlements I ever saw for this reason that it was instituted by a combination of landlords of whom the Duke of Argyll was one and we lived under the regulations then as comfortably as any people could have done
Yes of Tobermory
I was about five years learning a little of my profession away
Tolerably well I have known it so well that I have despaired of it at last
Yes
Not in any instance I am aware of
Entirely
A great number I recollect a great number since I was a boy and particularly in the island of Mull
On the lands of Glenforsa there are about nine miles of glen which was inhabited by the best tenantry in Mull and they were obliged to leave for the factor who took the land there a Mr MQuarrie
From Morinish there was also a great number sent away to clear the land for a man of the name of Cameron
The land was then owned by Mr MCaskill
It was for the purpose of making large tacks and because it was more handy to get the rent that way than from the crofters
No
When I came here to practise my profession I happened to be at Tyree and at Kennoway there was a tenant sent out and instead of the croft being given to some deserving crofter it was added to the farm of Mr Campbell of Balfinish
They were all sent away
No I never read anything about it but I speak from my own experience
I was secretary to the Emigration Commissioners hers in  and there was a man from Ulva here who was sent away not by Mr ClarkMr Clark did not send any away but by the Emigration Society
The people were sent away by the Emigration Society and the Poor Law Board
Mr Crawford was proprietor at the time and the people were sent away by the Poor Law Board
Undoubtedly and it has increased it in Tobermory
They not only became perhaps themselves but they have made paupers of the poor settlers who were there before them and who were formerly independent
Yes and I believe there is a diminishing of the hill just now
I forgot to mention in my statement that there were only seventeen who had acquired the right previous to  and that I believe the present proprietor by his fencing off in the way he is doing and commencing to rear rabbits on his own estate is beginning a system which will have the effect of depriving them of the hill entirely that is what it leads me to believe
Only this year I believe
Mr Allan has upon his own home farm a number of them but not upon Tobermory as far as I am aware
But I believe he has commenced them and I for one have no affection for them
Not on this estate
I believe Colonel Gardyne has a deer park and I believe he has one of his farms with deer and sheep but I am not aware of any other
I think he has but I dont know whether the farm part is fenced
Yes
Yes
I should say so
Well I suppose so
Well I think the proprietor like an engineer is entitled to know the ground he goes upon before he buys it
He ought to have satisfied himself
I go a little further and I dont think what the law endorses is all that the landlord has to look to
I think when he buys a subject he must look to the intrinsic value of it and to the conditions of let and when there are parties upon it to what their rights are
I dont think the State should go and pay him such a fanciful price as that but if he found that he could not enjoy this estate at its proper price then if we can do without himas I am becoming of opinion we can do without landlords he could get the intrinsic value of the estate not what he might call it or what he might be inclined to give for it but the intrinsic value of the estate
I would pay the intrinsic value for a croft if I was going to take it
I was asked what was best suited for Tobermory and I gave my opinion upon it but probably I did not consult what the law has done when I gave that answer
I may add that if we returned to the former settlement we would expect to get the land at its real value according to valuation
We consider the landlords have too much freedom particularly one landlord
If we had the wisdom of a dozen we might perhaps get justice but when we are at the mercy of one it is not so
I may say also that there are some very good and kind landlords but it is too bad that the ownership of the land should be at the caprice of one man
I believe if matters were mended it would have a tendency to reduce pauperism and lunacy which is rather a frightsome thing at present
There are some
What I understand to be cottars are those on farms for working the farms  but all those in this place have rights except I believe a few on Mr Caldwells estate who have been there a long time back and who occupy the houses and pay something like s a year
I dont think they have any title but they have a good bit of garden and a house
Yes there are several
I asked the factor once if the rents were not too high and he said they were but that when a croft was empty there were so many coming forward to take it
I argue from that that the landlord should be a man of some mind  that he should say  You shall go thus far and no further and that when he does not do that he forgets his position
I believe there is a regular hunger for land
I believe if Tobermory was provided with the wants of its own people it ought to be quite sufficient for it that is of those that require accommodation to their houses there and I think those who have cottars on their land should just retain them
Perhaps in connection with that I may mention that my opinion is that we ought to have a general poorlaw instead of having so many parochial systems here and there  because if it is a national defect it ought to be nationally administered and at far less expense and trouble and for this reason that if such a law had existed Mr Clark of Ulva and other proprietors would have had no inducement to send their people to the next proprietor or the next parish
Under the present system the consequence is that these paupers return upon him and others tenfold under our poor laws they gain no settlement when they are awayand if we had a general poor law there would be no inducement to landlords to send them away
It was fear of paupers that made Mr Clark send his crofters away
I have heard it said that if the people had not been sent away by him they would have sent him away
I believe they would pay their rents by the lobsters on the shores
I began farming in  and I never heard a complaint scarcely against the Duke or factor until the end of  or  I was acquainted with three factors and I paid rent to two of them
When I got the land it was in a place where there were no removals or evictions then unless it would be for being a bad neighbour or not paying rent or being a smuggler
There was one from Creich made an example of and two defied the chamberlain to give up distilling whisky and I got the croft one of them had
All the grounds and houses were included and I was to begin draining and begin to build a house and I built a new house there and all the crofters were at the tune budding their own houses They were getting no assistance
I had to send a man and boat to Lismore for lime and I built the house in the year  and a barn and byre
Now the house was good and Alexander Campbell is living opposite here
Lord Clydes father was lodging with Mr Campbell the whole of the last years he was in Mull and the very kitchen he had in that house was his room
His daughter came for him then and took him to Edinburgh and he lived only about six months after he left this country
After this I was removed from that place where I built the house and was obliged to leave my sash windows twelve panes in each and I was removed to Ardachy and those people were emigrating and I had to buy two common windows and then I began to drain in Ardachy and improve the ground and some of the houses too
I made about  drains of Scotch measure in Ardachy
The first two or three years I was there I was buying meal for my family because the manure was taken to another farm and the ground was ploughed down by the man who went away with the manure
But the last two years I was selling meal
Then I was removed in  to Lee the upper part of Ardtun over the hill
I was working the two worst crofts on the estate
My son and other men began to drain there and he has made  odd drains there and a lot of blasting
It is twentyfour years now since I was removed and another croft was promised me when I was removeda croft better than the two I have especially in those bad and wet seasons we had
Oh no only twice
Not a single sixpence
No his Grace the Duke of Argyll does not know what we were suffering he does not know we were ploughing ground to him without wages or meat except the lunch at noon bread and cheese and a glass of whisky or perhaps a bottle of beera glass of whisky or two
My eldest son who died lately was in Ardachy ploughing and other crofters with him another day with a pair of horses
The ploughing was not finished and I was pointed out and my eldest son went the second day and was there all day without a morsel for himself or horses except what his mother sent
You speak about the drains I was drain measurer in Ross and the drains were opened and there was    s laid out upon my own croft for opening the drains
We had to close them with stones ourselves and I had to pay s  of interest
I was five years before I was removed in   s
I paid in five years for the s laid out
In another case and I never heard a murmur before that against the family of Argyll or the factor but in Suie there was a man of the name of Macdonald and he was evicted and the croft given to the parish schoolmaster who was in Bunessan
There was some murmuring about that but when he left another man Alexander Livingston came in and it was  Is d that was laid out upon his croft opening the drains and closing them
And then the chamberlain had no clerk at the time and the sheriff officer was here opposite here living so an old clerk and he had the rent taxed and showed me before my eyesrent s for the  Is d s in the pound but mine came to s d
I was then removed to Lee and a croft was promised me and I never got it
Just at the place where I wasLee
Two small crofts
Not the one that was promised me
I had overstock when I left Ardachy
No my complaint is the high rent
 s was my rent when I went there
In the year  it was raised to  There were eight crofts in that
It was then the rent was raised
That was the first rent from  to  Now in  it was raised from  to 
My share is  s with assessment  Is d
Yes and it is not rent altogether but the bad ground
I had no potatoes for the last five or six years but the year  except a few
Yes
It is better and it is the dry weather that makes it better
Yes we have no complaint against the Duke factor or ground officer
I know the parish nineteen years but I am not in my present place so long as that
I know them pretty well in the Creich district and the south side I am not so well acquainted with Ardtun
Not with the places of all of them I know the places of some
They have just stated them as I have always known them state them
No I have no land
No I see scarcely any difference not any noticeable difference
I hear a greater cry about it  I hear the cry about being poor more for the last year or two than before
Yes when the weather admits of it
A good deal
Yes and some have to cross an arm of the sea
Yes in the winter time especially
He pays a visit occasionally to the school and enforces the clause in so far as it can be enforced
Well parties were summoned to Tobermory and defaulters were often brought before the board
I never heard that there was any actual punishment
Yes it had the effect of making the attendance better
But it would require to be repeated before it would have any permanent effect
The chamberlain is one Mr Pitcairn Teroran Mr Campbell Mr MIntyre and Mr Campbell the minister of the parish
I could not say but whenever there is any special business bringing them together a meeting is held
In the board room Bunessan
Whenever I complain they pay due attention
I never knew them fail to attend to a complaint
There are some in the special subjects there are some good scholars
Four or five have been attempting that but they have not been regular
They only took up that subject when they were about past school
No I have more in the specific subjects every year than formerly although the average attendance is getting a little less
There is a little difficulty the teacher is so much hampered by the standard work of the school that he cannot give as much attention to the extra subjects as he would like to do
No I just have the class and any one whom I think qualified to take up the subject I allow to join the class that is after he is out of the standard work or if he can manage his standard with ease along with Latin I allow him to join the class
Not outside the School Board  none in the neighbourhood of the school
Yes they visit and inspect the school sometimes independent of Her Majestys inspector
That has been done several times
It acts as a stimulus
I dont know anything about that
I have a sort of recollection that I got a little in that way but it came indirectly to me and I was told it was given by his Grace
The prizes that have been given have been given by the School Board
No other prizes have been given that I recollect of in my time
I cannot say I never inquired
There have been  not every year but it has been done sometimes
I remember two or three times
Ardnamurchan
Yes
No I got my first school in this parish
Yes
I think they are better fed and better clad and better housed here than in Uist
I cannot speak as to that but the land I think is better
A good many
The attendance of the cottar class is not so regular and their intelligence is not quite up to the average of the crofter children nor their clothing
That is Cameron my impression
Yes through the potato crop having failed and the grain crop not being so good
Yes no doubt
Yes and the absence of employment
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
For the last  years
No they were born and bred on Ardalanish
During that period
Solely
I cannot say that any of them were inherited
I only succeeded my forefathers
In the whole of them
Not since I occupied any part or portion of them
Yes
When I left home I had no intention to be examined but whatever questions you will be pleased to ask directly I will try to give an account
Yes
Thoroughly too well some of them
Certainly
I consider they were never worse off than they are in the present year
Last year was a serious year to all who had any farms in their possession
The mortality among the sheep and cattle was very great consequently the tenants must bear that
This year particularly was the worst that I recollect since I was born
I believe not
When I compare my own vouchers I know that I stand more in arrears than I did about twenty or thirty years ago owing to t h e mortality among sheep and cattle
The valuation shows that clearly
I am not very sure that I know the date
I cannot exactly give any definite answer to that I bad not an interest in that
I believe some of them ought to be very thankful it was taken from them because it would be ruination to a good many of them
For the want of means and rents are considered there very sharp
Of course if times were good they would be able to pay the rent and the price of wool at present is very low and formerly it was a great help to all the farmers
Yes at a more moderate rent
Partly
If any one is sharply rented and losing by a farm he has not the same interest in it as if he were accumulating some wealth
I heard it today distinctly described that they would not take any leases on the present rental
But I heard one individual say he was paying  s and if he had the croft at  he would take a lease
I think when he tries to live at a rent of  he ought to be more comfortable at 
Greatly increased
Perhaps double that it would be in the power of the proprietor and the one who would be so foolish as take them
But that would not pay the party
That shows that my rent is too high
I believe it could be let at the same rent even at the present date so far as I see
I dont see any changes on that
All the vacant crofts to have big rents and farms equally so
I mean to say which is very clear that a present tenant would not give the present rent of his farm although it was out of lease in the morning so far as I understand
I think they were more independent and better clad
Very few had leases from the proprietor on this property long ago  it was only large and extensive farmers such as Scoor Fiden and I believe long ago Ardtun
I think these were the farms that were held under leases
I am not sure as to that long ago
No not all
Yes a few who do not pay a penny at all
They are independent
The want of means
They are very poor and what they have is perhaps not their own lawful property
They are uncommonly poor
It was of course they got relief from London Edinburgh and Glasgow
It was and did a great deal of good
At the time of planting potatoes they got a good many seed potatoes which they all planted and they suited very wellsent by his Grace the Duke of Argyll
A great many long ago
They were in good circumstances then and they left this country for Canada
 per cent better
Yes
I do not consider that in the rural country the Education Act has made any improvement
It has levied a great deal of assessment on all the ratepayers of the parish
Children now do not attend very regularly and must have a compulsory officer to cause them to attend and before they would attend of their own pleasure
According to law they must attend now
Very excellent even at the present day we are considered to have the best teachers in Scotland here
Yes who showed very brilliant in their colleges
There is not so many of them as there used to be
Very high indeed
I never took the view of it that it was a good thing for this parish
Yes
Very good
Yes in the month of April last
Most useful it was a very great boon to them that
I never saw the potatoes more promising than they are at present
No
Yes
In Martinmas  my father and my grandfather and I were in Knocknafeannaig
I made improvements in that place by the directions of his Grace of Argyll in  I went on with the improvements until  and in that year Mr Campbell the factor came
I built the house at my own expense
In  a tenant came in and six of the crofters were dispossessed of their holdings and their places given to the one man
The six were dispossessed of their crofts for the sake of this one man who took their place
One of them is here Donald Macdonald
I was left without a place and my father got a house from Mr MIntyre
I then went to Colonsay to look after some employment
I got six years employment from Lord Colonsay and Professor Mackinnon knows that
Yes for four years
Yes
Yes my forefathers were there and my father was put out for the sake of this man and also the rest of the five tenants
Yes
Yes
Yes
Mr MNiven
No he came from Islay
He was draining the estate he has made his fortune
The Duke did not know anything of this
The late factor I think reported to the Duke that the people were in arrears
It is not the Dukes fault
No not a shilling
That is so
I would desire to get the land my ancestors had if that were possible if not if I could get a portion in any other part of the estate
Yes
At the same rent that MNiven is paying
The chief
I dont know
I  have been a fisherman from my youth and that source of living for the  last sixteen years has been getting less and less and now in my old  age I would be glad if possible to get a piece of land
I am
I am still fishing
Lobster during the whole year except summer and salmon fishing in summer for the last eight or nine years
Clark and MLean in Ulva
For myself
Yes
I have the whole place round Ulva and Gometra
Mr MQuarrie  we are in shares
Erraid Island since thirty years
Yes I was there thirty years fishing winter and summer all round
Yes every kind of fish is getting scarce
Yes
Yes
Yes there is
People are so poor and they cannot prosecute the fishing in summer because there is no way of curing the fish
Between Iona and Dhu Heartach
Oh yes
Plenty
Just good boats and help for the poor fishermen
Yes
Yes I am sure of it if the fish are as plentiful now as they were in my time
There are plenty of herring passing if there was a good boat to get them
Yes I am  sure of it  and every year since I have commenced I have seen plenty of  them between Dhu Heartach and Iona and out here just the same
It was never tried outside
I am quite sure of it
Plenty of good islands all round the coast and good harbours too
No the fishermen could get ashore in any place
Yes
And willing if they had the means to do it
Oh yes very good
I am not aware that they did
No
I have one but the way I put out so much money on the salmon fishing  and did not do anything with it I was not able to get herring nets to  try it but I am very willing
Yes
Yes
Thirty feet
Yes
She was built at Loch Carron
Big enough  she was at the herring fishing before I got her
Yes but she is big enough for this coast
Yes I am quite sure of it  for twentyfour summers I was curing cod and ling and it paid me well
Yes
I have sent   tons of dried fish away and I used to get  and  s a ton
The majority of them are getting so poor that they cannot get stores and material and boats to put up all that is required
Yes
There are too many fishing them
No
No that is what is spoiling them fishing through the summer
It was not put in force
Yes
It has kept them thus far
I could manage to keep four or five cows  I would not want a bigger size than that
I many a time asked a croft and did not get it yet
Yes
Yes
Yes the rent is too high
Not at the same rent
I  would prefer land  I am getting too old for fishing
I was twentyfour  years paying rent for one end of a house
It was built so close to the  shore that the tide came in and I had to thatch it and keep it in  repair and pay  rent for the bare house
Then I got the whole house  for  At last the rent was raised to  the bare house
To Mr Campbell the factor
No I had to leave it
No I had not just a wee bit garden that would raise a barrel of potatoes
Mr MNiven
He has a big farm and the house goes with the farm
I had the fishing there for the last eight years
I do
I dont remember that
Only four shepherds and two or three cottars
I have heard it said there were eighty families on it
I heard that but cannot speak to it
About thirty years ago
It was the present proprietor
It was once a good island but it is not very fertile now it is grown with weeds rushes and ferns
I dont know but I think it was the MQuarries
Yes
It  would be well for the fishermen if the Government would put some  restriction upon the fishing
They are carting them in the summer and  half of them die before they reach the market
If they were not fished  at that time these fish would be useful
When I am fishing lobsters that boat is my home
Yes but I am still fishing
I believe I could
I know the  fishing grounds well and if I had a crew and sufficient nets and boats  I could make a good living
I heard one of the delegates making a statement or two which I think not correct
With reference to the horse park it was my brother who had the property before we got it and there was a horse park which belonged to the small tenants previously and when he came there in  the stone and turf dyke was knocked down in many parts and I understand my brother offered the tenants the park the same as formerly and that he put materials upon the ground to erect fences again if they choose to do it  and they did not choose to do it and hence the reason they have not the park at present
I wont say that but this was in  I could not say that upon my own part because I am only joint proprietor
Since January
From
That was before my brothers time
No not that I am aware of nothing whatever
Some of them have retired and we have one or two of the crofts in our own hands which we were willing to have relet if the tenants had wished
Yes I believe my brother increased the rent a little but since then we have been giving them a cow each for the winter for the use of the crofts so that the increase has not been very much perhaps   or so or perhaps s in some cases
 acres
We offered the whole ground to the small tenants this year as a club farm if they choose to give us security for the stock and offered them two years to pay the stock
The old rents
Yes
 for the one end and  for the other
That includes the inn however which is let separately
We would give it all to them and give them two years to pay it
I dont think there are any of the older people there
Those that were there previously are away out of the country as far as I am aware
We would allow the tenants who are there to take it between them
They could not do it I suppose
It could not be done easily the marches would not suit
You could not make a distinct march unless you put up a fence
No my late brother bought it as a place of residence and as an investment
Yes  when my brother had the property he farmed part of it himself the west end Glenleedale and it is in the valuation roll at  and the east end he let which was in the possession of other parties
No none  it was very difficult to keep between my brother and the tenant at the other end
Yes but the sheep were always mixing and it would be more difficult if tenants went in
Yes possible  but very expensive
I am afraid they could not
They say they are very poor  they are very lazy I know
I dont think they take the advantage of fishing that they might The loch is at their door and it is full of fish
They do cuddies and white fish
Oh yes quite well
There is a little loch at the head of Loch Scridan and it is quite protected and the upper side of it is sheltered from the west and southwest wind
I think so
There is nothing in the way of a harbour or pier it is all shore

The only thing we have to say is that we complain that the rents are higher than the land is worth
More than twenty
They vary
About  that is  for one croft
The most of them have two crofts paying from  to  and 
About 
About six and a half acres that is an average
I cannot tell the extent of it
It is not good
Some have four five and six cows on the two crofts that is the whole stock
Two horses besides
No sheep
Our pasture is a moss between our township and Bunessan and there was at one time a place where peat was cut
A few
A good many about Ardtun
No except what they get from the crofters they get a bit generally from the crofters gratis to put potatoes in
I moved to Ardtun in  At that time the rent was  Then it was raised to

Then it was raised to

The last rise was about seven years ago
It has been very much improved by myself
Draining and reclaiming
I drained about  roods of the ground and built houses and many other things
Dwellinghouse stable and byre
The whole places were in perfect ruin when  went
No  there was no such thing allowed at that time but since this hooley  came we get all things we require such as lime and wood
No not a penny
I got   in Mr Wyllies time for damage done by storm and for repairing the houses again
No
Not one that I know
I think they are just as well wanting them while their rents are so high  they cannot stand the pressure on them owing to the high rent
I  dont know
I am not aware that any compensation was given for any  improvements of lands or houses previous to the present chamberlains  time of office but lately lime is given in every improvement that may  be necessary about the buildings
I know something about her case she was near me in the township
A twelvemonth last May
I cannot exactly tell his age
Between fourteen and fifteen
I dont know myself but there may be others who know
I heard it
Yes she had a full stock and was able to pay the rent
I cannot say further than that I heard she was not to get the land
He is not a schoolmaster he was a schoolmaster
Yes
Yes he is collector of poor rates and clerk to the School Board
She understood that to be the case
I heard that it was in the papers but I did not see it myself
I have heard that such was done but I cannot speak of it from my own knowledge
She is living in the village of Bunessan
Yes
She has a little shop
I was hearing these matters but I was not inquiring
She left the place on the term day
She keeps a little shop in the village
Donald MLean junior
I think he does
Alexander MGregor
I cannot say

I dont know  at all events he got it
I was hearing a great many speaking about it
I know it well
I am not aware of any person but the widow of John MEwan and she got the croft back
I dont know the rent

No not a bit of it cultivated and has not been for the last twenty years or more
Some left the kingdom
I cannot say for certain but some came to this neighbourhood
Twelve families
The land they had is a sheep farm under one tenant

A  croft in the place was added to the hill pasture and the rent of that  croft was divided among the tenants and my portion of that for the two  crofts came to  We considered it good value
Yes
I pay now  s for the two crofts
Exactly the same
About sixteen years ago
Yes
In
That is so and s more
Three cows on the croft and a horse
Twelve sheep on one croft
Yes
Six cows two horses and twelve sheep
Yes
Yes
It has always been under crop
I like the place well enough and the neighbours only I consider the rent too high
I think if the rent was about  it would give me room to live
Some of the crofts are better than others and those I  have if they were drained and reclaimed would be worth fully more than  when I went
We would take a lease from the Duke
Yes if the rent was reasonable
No we are not prepared to take a lease just now
I  spoke to the chamberlain about a reduction and he said he could not do  anything in the meantime he would speak for me and I think he will do  it
Yes a good many
Some were complaining and some bad enough
They were tiding over as best they could
I cannot say that their state was worse than those who had the land
No
No neither of us were we were helping our parents
I am not aware that any person lost an inch
Our  only complaint is that the rent is too high and if we get it down we  will be all comfortable
I have a small matter to bring before the  Commission which was entrusted to me by a neighbour
When I came to the  crofts I now have they were in the hands of the factor and the grass  that was then in the crofts the neighbours got it to put their cows in
For this privilege some paid s some more and one paid s
That got  into the Dukes books and remained so until this time
The rent was  raised a short time after that and I was of opinion that they are  confounding what they were paying for the privilege of grazing upon this  croft with the rise which was made upon the rent
I am only speaking as  I was informed I cannot say myself I was not in the country at the  time

About 
Yes she was married twice and it was the land that her husband had that was taken from her
Yes they were in good circumstances
My father died when I was only an infant but my stepfather was in good circumstances
Yes
Wherever we would get it
Some of us would be
I would myself and others would also
The croft would always stand good and I might still be going backwards and forwards as I now am
Some of them are three or four at least others of them are very poor
 dont know very particularly about the case I know the man  he is here
It is difficult for me to say generally with regard to that but I dont see how they can live at all as they are
Some of them are poorer than they were others are much about the same condition
That is their demand
I am a cattle dealer
Yes sometimes better sometimes worse
It goes on as before
I paid one rent for both the house and the garden
The house is about six or seven years old
It was not asked
Yes perhaps more than five but five anyhow
I built it
It did not cost much
If you get suitable stone here it can be built cheap there is not much outlay excepting the wood
It has not been usual in the place to give compensation
Well it was an old house that was remade and I leased the land just went to one of those old houses and made it suitable for habitation
No it is one of our own houses we did not leave the houses although we lost the land
No but I have heard people who have seen it and who signed it
No not I
Not to my knowledge but the people who signed it told me they did so
It seems not
 s d I think
We were in Balphuil first
Thirty years
My father
About 
None upon us
I may state the reasons perhaps
The rents were raised twice forbye the drainage money and it was sent by the factor amongst the tenants to divide amongst themselves and they valued the crofts amongst themselves and if you did not take so much of this rent which is given in lately you will give me your croft and the crofters had to remove back and forward amongst themselves
Yes among themselves and we had to give up one of the crofts we had for one of these light sandy ones and latterly we were removed down there altogether
Yes it was in old times that such as Lachlan MKinnon bought the rental that is when he bought the stock it was understood that he bought the use of the rental along with it
He would have some stock but it was understood he would have the benefit of the croft by buying the rental
Yes his Grace allowed them to sell the rental
John Maclean bought his place that was what he did
It was understood he had it while he paid his rent
It seems they had before factor Campbells days
Yes my father bought his first croft the same way in Balphuil
Thirtyeight years ago I think since factor Campbell came
About six tons to each family on an average
Some can do with less and some more
From Ardrossan
The price varies sometimes s s and s d and it has been as high as s per ton
They were allowing  on an average for each family some require more than six tons
I am not aware of any
Oh yes
Yes
Yes
A good many
Yes
Generally they do
As far as I know I dont think it would in most cases it would not
Yes Donald Macdonald
Yes
All we know is this the paper was not read to us at all but the ground officer had a lot of notices to quit in one hand and this paper in another and we were told that the contents of the paper were that we would require to obey anything that the Duke of Argyll or his factor would ask us to do
It was written
Yes
Yes
He was here he may be here yet
In the time of the present Duke
I am not aware of any who read the paper before he put his hand to it
The factor was not present upon the occasion  our only information regarding the paper was what the ground officer told us at the time
I believe it was the same paper that every crofter in Tyree signed
I believe I signed my name  I can sign my name
It would be about thirtyfive years ago some two or three years after Mr Campbell got the management of the estatesJohn Campbell Bailenoe
Probably it was in the year  Mr Campbell got the management of the estate in  and it was the year after
I did not sign it myself but everybody in the township where I lived signed it
He told us
Twenty years
Yes an adjacent croft was added to it since that time
I cannot very well tell you the exact extent of arable ground
There was a good deal of arable ground once but the sand drifted and I gave up cultivating it and I have it mostly under pasture now
All the grazing is enclosedthe whole land is enclosed grazing and all
There was a strip that used to be common pasture to the remaining crofters in the township but it was a cause of difference between us and it was valued and added to the rest and fenced in
No myself and my brother had it at the beginning
No it was not of much use to the farm or to me and I did not ask it
But the marches suited to put them together
The tenant of it is still upon the croft
He had to give it up for he had no stock and fell back
He gave it up of his own accord
No
 s d
Yes the same
No not so far as the arable cultivation is concerned because we are subject to the drifting of sand on the place but the grazing stock is more profitable now
It is quite a common practice
The practice is to give the grazing for the six months of summer and autumn
It is not the practice to charge for winter grazing
And the price depends exactly on the condition of the outrun for the time being whether the tenants keep a greater or less amount of stock upon it
Sometimes it is down to s as this year and sometimes it is as high as s
There is not so far as I am aware a single crofter in Tyree who would give pasture for a cow within what we call the ring fence within the arable portion  he might allow it to graze upon the outrun but not to pasture within the croft
Seven shillings to s for as much as a cow would pick up
It has sometimes been down to s
On the goodwill of his neighbours
I am not aware
The cow is allowed to feed as it may as much as it can gather outside without any charge but any hand feeding is paid for
It is very difficult to say what the outlay of a cottar is a cow would require to be well fed   but no cottar lays out that amount
I really cannot tell there is many a one I know who feeds a cow has not   to spare  how he does it I dont know
No I am not dissatisfied
I have no fear that I will be dispossessed as long as I pay my rent
The houses were built before I went there but I believe they were built by the tenant and that the proprietor had nothing to do with them
Nothing
I really cannot say what may happen in the future but that has been the practice of the place
I am not aware that there has been for small holdings like ours
Yes
 He lived in a different township
No I dont remember any that had a very large holding an ordinary croft
Yes
So far as I know many of them went away of their own free will
I am not aware
I believe some of them were in arrear
I know others went away and sold the croft
The phrase selling the croft means of course selling the crops and the stock and the houses but there is also something of the nature of goodwill that perhaps is rather difficult to explaina sense of possession that grew
One would give more for the crops because he was to enter into possession of the land
Yes I heard and I saw the men
Yes I know that there was great dissatisfaction but whether the cause of that might be justified of course would be another matter
The people spoke of great dissatisfaction
I had no land at the time I was young and without care and did not take much heed of the matter
Yes
Yes
There are plenty of their descendants still in the place
They were made about that time
I know that some of them would be very glad to have them anyhow and would be able to take them
Others would not have been able to take them
They are in a much better position
Well they are all present here those who asked assistance last year
Each man can answer for himself in that respect but I neither required nor asked for assistance
Some of those who have no land are quite as well off as some of those who have
Some of them in the cottar class with a trade or the like of that are better off than the poorer of the crofter class
Any person can understand which class is best off of course it is the crofter class
The small crofter invariably says so
Well he would get the opportunity of having his choice pretty often if he did say it
It could be turned to a small croft any day if he pleased

Twelve years I believe
Two farms

A Mr Campbell
Exactly
Messrs Sproat and Cameron writers Tobermory
Exactly in the same way
None whatever an occasional crofter may have got two crofts instead of having one before
No
It was on account of natural causes in most of the cases because the people emigrated
Very little perhaps fifty or sixty people
Oh yes
Most of them very favourable and would not like to return
No very few have gone I may say none at all
I cannot say for the short time I have been here I cannot say I know any difference
Yes not my immediate predecessor
None
Yes
About  is the lowest rent where there is any lease
No
No very little
Yes
No
Oh yes he has got two estimates made very recentlyone last year and the other the year before
Yes from eminent engineers
They would not guarantee that the pier would stand
Yes
Yes and these were submitted to the Duke
They were afraid it would not stand it is so very stormy
Yes
No
No
There might be an isolated case but no general raising of rent
Not at all
Yes the price of stock has been very high this year
No I think not
This year and the end of last year was exceptional three or four years ago it was exceptional
Yes
I cannot say there is much of anything except live stock
Once a week
There are three steamers and they call once a week they all call on the same day
Yes
No
No
Not very
No very great distress
I dont think so
Yes to a certain extent
It is not repaid yet
In some cases
Yes
The complaint was about that farm I got last Whitsunday
It seems the tenants of Balamartin always give a certain amount of labour for getting seaware off this farm and the same thing was attached to it when I got it
I did not make any new rules to them
Yes
Yes
It is still the same
Yes
Not at all it was always understood between the tenant of that farm and those smaller tenants
That is a bargain with the proprietor
No I did not discover it until after I took the farm
I suppose I did
Two or three days in the year and they have to put up fifteen carts of seaware off the shore
Yes
About two days
In some instances about perhaps  or  yards and in other places longer than that
We talked about it
No
I may state that I find the arrangement very troublesome and if they can do without the wrack I will do without their work
I have often sent my carts there and could not get a pound of wrack on the shore
Yes
That would be a very difficult arrangement to make because the seaware all comes in a sort of common and it would be difficult to arrange to give them a share of itin fact almost impossible
The kelp manager is here himself and perhaps might give you some evidence
Yes but I wish to go to Bunessan where Mr Wylie will be I have been taking notes for him
No I dont let farms at all
Just doing any work through the estate and collecting the rents once a year
Yes
I am quite admitted to do that if the Duke or chamberlain asks me
To a certain extent
The character of the holding is retained very much
In some cases they have been enlarged and in some cases they have been reduced
It is a difficult question to answer I would rather not answer it
It is a grazing farm now but it was arable a good deal of it at one time
No
I am not an arable farmer here
Yes
I think they are very fair farmers here
You say you have seen old grey oats and rye I dont think anything else would grow here in the land you have seen that in except barley
The soil is very light there is something in the nature of it that wont grow large oats
That must arise from the soil I think
It might arise from all these it depends very much on the farmer
Yes I think the people here are good farmers on the whole
They all keep two horses here as a rule
They seem to make some money out of their horses
They keep them as a source of revenue
Yes
There has been no general rise that I am aware of
There may have been before my time I could not speak to that
About 
I could not say as to that
So it seems
I think the most of the increase was on the larger farm  decidedly
Between  and 
I believe from ten to a dozen or so
I am not aware whether that rule exists
They have never been asked for
No I have been here such a short time I cannot speak to that
Yes
I dont know I only know the fact
No as a farmer
Well I am very fond of farming
Not at all
I was appointed to the office first
That was a year before I had a farm
I dont think I stated that it was once cultivated but not by me
Very little of that has been cultivated
No
Eight hundred acres altogether
I really never thought of that  I could not say
Yes but I have never made up the acres of that
I have the Ordnance Survey maps but I never made up the acres of arable land because it is all under grazing now
No not at all there are a great many widows here who have crofts
No I dont think so
I dont know  I would not like to answer that question
I cannot say that I see much difference
I suppose it is greatly out of curiosity
They will have an interest in the Commission coming here  it is very natural that they should come and see what is going on
I would not like to answer that question
I have found them always very nice people
Yes I can
No
I think it is a very good thing there is not
I have never heard them complain
I could not say
Oh yes some time before
I suppose they may get it from a neighbour
Well there are ways and means alwaysby having it in the house they will get it from the steamers
No
I suppose there was one at one time
I dont know
It was before my time and I never inquired
I believe it was for their good the Duke did it  there is no doubt about that because I believe he would get a large rent for a public house there
There is no doubt it was done for their good
I know he always takes an interest in them and would like them to be well off
I cannot say
He comes and stays for a day or two and he sends clothes and books to be distributed amongst the people
Yes
Yes
By my wife
I suppose they must have been worse off last year than other years
Yes I applied myself for some for the people here
I admit there was that
No doubt about it
Oh yes no doubt of it and they did a good deal of damage
Oh yes there is a temperance hotel
Yes
One of them was in the hands of a resident tenant and one of them in the hands of an absentee
Just where they were
They are all resident on the island
Yes
Oh yes
Two other cases besides myself
Three farms on which there is no separate tenant
None
The benefit of the road is entirely theirs more or less the benefit is theirs except a small piece at the end of it
Yes it is meant for the township
They have always been keeping up that road themselves but how long or what time they take to work upon it I dont know
I have never heard that statement before
I know they spend a good deal of labour on it  there is a good deal of labouring in keeping that road
It is
Not until this year but he has offered to do it this year
Not at all but they represented to me it was a hardship and I spoke to the chamberlain and the Duke said he was willing to assist to keep it up
The company farm some land to keep their horses in food
I suppose they would find it cheaper to work their own land
They do a great deal of good to the island
I cannot say
The manager of the company is here and he may say I dont know much about their business at all
I heard that that was the case
In some instances I have heard where they have got money
That is spoken of by the people
No never
I could not say whether he is or not
Just a regular store or shop
No I am not aware that they purchase anything
Yes
Yes there is an agricultural show held here every year
Cattle and horses and butter
No just an ordinary agricultural show
No
Yes
A large number of them
No the people pay for the bulls themselves
Yes
Highland cattle
Yes there are one or two dairy farms but principally Highland cattle
Yes on some of the larger farms
No
Blackfaced sheep and Leicester rams

Meal and money
Glasgow
We got a little from the Lord Mayors fund about a week ago
I suppose they were made by the proprietor and they are kept up by the road trustees
Yes
I could not say
There is a good deal of fencing in the island but it is principally wire
It is the boundary of the township as yet
Yes the whole of them I think
There is not much stone fencing
Plenty rocks if you blast them
No
I think so
Yes
No
I could not form an estimate but I know it must be a considerable item in their expense but I could not form an estimate
All coal
I think that is a high enough estimate for a small crofter
Yes
Perthshire
Yes on Sir Donald Curries estate
Yes as ground officer
I would say they are
Principally the smaller crofters
Entirely of the cottar class
A good substantial crofter would
I hope so
Twentythree years
I had for twenty years but I gave it up two years ago
Yes
Yes
Yes
I have
Pretty well
I have since you resumed after lunch
Not since I came
There have been only two farms cleared since I came Scaranish and another
Yes
Quite true
They have not been much increased since I came except in some isolated cases
There was an increase before I came
I am
A great number of them are poorly off and some are as well off as the crofter class
Yes
They are badly off
The crofters who pay  are not so well off as those paying above that sum but where they have families in the south they support them and some of them are pretty well off
Of course their crofts are not able to pay their rents as well as crofts say of  or 

Say about thirtytwo acres or so
Two horses eight to ten cows and some sheep
No  because they would quarrel among themselves with sheep in their outruns
That has been the case as far as I can see
A number do but a number have families in the south at sea or working as agricultural labourers and they send them home money from the south to support their parents
There is a good many of that class in the island
Yes
Certainly and they would have larger boats
It is
They are really very good
Yes
They compare favourably with any of the other islands as regards physical condition
Yes averagely healthy
Yes I do as to the children The cottar class children appear to be in want of milk a good deal as compared with the crofter class
Of course
There is not but if they had a large outrun for cattle they could cultivate their crofts
There is not a large outrun vacant as far as I am aware
According to the population there is at present
About 
I suppose about  or 
There are some crofts of  and 
Yes
Yes
There are a few but a large number would not be able to take them that is without outside assistance
No there was then a population of something like
There is sufficient population for the land
Rather to make a living
It would be still the same
Not much emigration to foreign parts
A great deal
I have
I saw one or two who had gone but they had only newly gone
I have
Their condition is that they would not return although they would get their land back again for nothing
I am
No in fact there was no improvement
Yes
I am
I have been since the passing of the Act
Fairly
There is difficulty in getting them to go at certain times of the year
There is
Yes but there is one township complaining a littleat least there was a complaintit was a Free Church school and they wanted a board school and there were some complaints but the place was well enough supplied at the time and we did not think it desirable to erect a board school in the meanwhile
Tyree was well off as regards education before because the Free Church sent students here regularly  and they sent good men
And we have been so far fortunate in getting some good teachers since the passing of the Act and I do not see much change
We are
Yes
No
Yes
Yes they were able
Their friends assisted them from the south and their families did not come home this year as they used to do
Some of them come home that have been serving in the south as agricultural labourers but last year they did not come and so were able to send more home
Yes a number come in the winter time
Yes a greater number remain now than when I came here first
They will
There will
It is at present I would say it would carry about  or so
If there was a decrease of  it would be enough
Certainly not
I would only increase the holdings of the crofters as one crofter died out adding the one to the other
I might where there was a very large farm
Yes
Some of them
Others could not very well be given to crofters such as Hynish
They have ground for complaint for want of a proper harbour and want of small harbours for fishing
I think so
Not easily without a good deal of money but they have never been tried
Say for a principal harbour it would cost  or  to make a pier
Yes
They would
Not less than  or  
Certainly it would to the fishing and cottar class they would get larger boats and prosecute the fishing to a larger extent and go further out
The principal harbour would pay good interest I have no doubt upon the produce that leaves the island
It would pay  per cent
I think so
Two townships
Eighteen or nineteen years ago
Yes
I suppose arrears of rent that is the only reason I heard at the time
Yes
My opinion is that a fisherman could not prosecute his fishing successfully with a croft
Yes that is my opinion
No
It is my own opinion but I believe that in a township where fishermen are they would require a small outrun for a few grazing cows to give their families milk
Not every fisherman a cow but that so many in a township should have cows so that they would be able to get milk
No just a few that there should be plenty of milk in the place for their children
Between s and s
Only the junior members
No decline
A few more of the luxuries have crept in among them
Their food has changed a good deal
Now they have tea and coffee twice a day instead of porridge and milk
Yes it is
No
Oban Tobermory Bunessan Glasgow
It is of late years
It is  it was only lately imported here
My faith is in oats and barley as yet because you cannot make wheaten bread into the forms that you can make oats and barley
No  no cases of the sort so far as I have seen
I have only seen one case of scurvy within the last ten years
Oh yes a good many cutaneous disorders
Not so far as I know  only cases of infection or local cases
Not for a long time
The last fever was typhoid seven or eight years agoa little of it
Yes
No I said that no person must go near it
No we left them in their own houses and when it was known that it was fever all the people kept away
Yes it was infectious
I have found typhoid to be infectious
No not typhus
I did
No
It was not necessary
I do
Because they heard there was a failure of the potato crop here they did not want to come home and burden their parents
No
I would add them to the crofts
That is what I mean
A crofter with forty or fifty acres is nearly as well off as a large farmer
I would rather not answer that question
I am
Not since I came here twenty years ago
Yes it has been since that time I think but I can only speak from
I do not understand quite
That would be the sense of it I think  that the island would support
Certainly not
No not that I am aware of
No certainly not
You might
Yes
It is no fault of the people it is the good communication with the southwith the towns
Yes
Yes
Supposing the lands were not there they gave the crop to the cows and that got them tea and sugar and meal from the south
No I place it all to the communication with the south
Because times have changed
Gentlemen now have taken to porridge and milk and the poorer classes  have taken to tea and coffee
I think so
Not much that I am aware of there may be a few things
Mr MDiarmid
Yes
Not much
Yes there are the Duke gives in the summer for agricultural shows some  every year
Yes
No
Lately I think he has been here every August
A day or perhaps two days
He does
No I see no change from his coming and going
Crime is unknown
The people are quiet and peaceable
I do  I never get an uncivil word
About  or
As far as I know they are I hear no complaints
Yes large farms say about  rent
There is one farm of that extent and others down from that to 
Yes
Yes
Commenced to improve it
Of course these things were before I came here
I suppose some of them were removed or removed themselves  I cannot say which
I am not aware of that
They voluntarily left
By improvement I mean he built good houses and introduced dairy farming
Both I think to make a little money and to bring Ayrshire farming perhaps into use there
Do you mean the original people
No not a great many because they did not take kindly to it at first they preferred Highland cows 
Campbelton
I believe so
Yes and I hear no complaints
It is
I believe there was but I dont know
The same as there is here by sailing ship and steamers once a week
I dont know
I dont know
Oh yes it has been repaired by cement being put into the holes
The factor I suppose
There might have been but it would be on the top
I am not aware that they petitioned very often but the place has been surveyed two or three times
I am not aware of that
Yes individual crofts made larger
There may be one or two but that is all under 
Yes
My wife is
Cornaig
Twelve or fourteen
These are people who were removed from Mr Stewarts ground
My fatherin law did
Colin Campbell
he doubled our crofts sending most of the crofters to one end of the outrun as cottars and introduced strangers from the township of Hellipool as he was to make a sheeptack of that township
Therefore upon the remainder of the crofters numbering thirteen it has fallen to pay that  rent of  and the expenditure of   yearly to each crofter for coals as we could not get any more peats making the total amount in rent and coals payable by us  yearly
Moreover year by year our crop is reduced in quality as the soil gets more inferior in quality each year
And last year we suffered so much from floods and storms that we had at last to apply to his Grace the Duke for assistance in the shape of seed to plant our ground
We applied also to the Duke for reduction of rent but his Grace would not grant our demand in regard to rent
DONALD MACDONALD delegate

No not at one time  it was raised twice
Yes
No reason whatever
The rent was raised a little before that time
Nothing
No
The peat bank was exhausted  there is no peat in the place to speak of
We got the seed but we were told we would get no reduction in the rent
We promised to pay it
Wo cannot tell it has not been asked yet
He does not ask money but he asks us for some work  and we do not pay this factor except what we paid to the previous tenants of the farm
The shore and the seaware belong to the farm of Hillipool and we have paid them for the seaware all along
Yes
It would be about s and
We get our food well
Well we dont think that we either injure his land or the roads but merely gather the drift ware that comes upon the beach we dont think any value ought to be exacted for it
No
No unless we work them and manure them we cannot pay our rents
We cannot say that
Certainly
We never were in Hillipool
Yes but a great portion of it is filled with cottars
Certainly they have deprived us of our grazing
I must needs pay the rent out of the proceeds of the croft for there is no means of earning wages in this land
No not now
 s d
I have three crofts
Yes practically the same
I would be very glad to get it at the rent my father paid about  s the three crofts for which I now pay  s d
Thirtytwo families
No
Yes
They were put out of Hillipool
Some of them before  was born or about that time  some others since
Yes
The factors servant got the one that my father had anyhow and his neighbours as well
Thirty shillings
I cannot tell
Not at that time our houses were old but a neighbour was removing from his houses
They were new and good and there was only one man going in and he occupied these houses
Afterwards when our own houses got bad we had to build them again
I cannot tell
Thatched houses covered over with felt others with ordinary thatch
Quite as good
Three
We cannot tell it was ourselves quarried the stones and built them
I did not get a penny whatever and I did not hear of any other person that did
No we did not ask for any assistance and the reason of it was this we were asked to leave the stone and wood of the old house for the new comer and we thought when we were asked that there was no use asking for any assistance at all
It is but right to say we did not leave it however we took it away with us
The high road
Nothing whatever
Not the breadth of the soles of our feet
Cod and ling lobsters and all kinds of fish about the shore
Sometimes the length of fifteen miles off the shore
Some send to Glasgow some sell it at the shops
Yes
We get  s to  s per ton for the ling and  per ton for the cod
Yes
Yes we never had it so good except last year
No we have no herring boats we have no place to keep them
Comparatively small they are  to  feet keel
Yes but we have none here because we cannot keep them
Yes some of us could
A harbour of refuge
We would require a breakwater as well as a pier
There are plenty of stones in the place
I think it could be made of concrete strong enough
No
Yes we would
Yes no assistance was granted
Noone
No nothing
No  not of those cottars I have named
Not in my day
I believe the factor employs a few of them
Drains and ditches
All that I can ever remember that he sent to Tyree in connection with the fishing was one boat with its complement of herring nets
Not a penny ever since I remember
Yes there are many of them away some at the east coast fishing some on board steamers and some in all quarters of the earth
Yes but the greater number of them go to sea
Steamers and ships too
I can speak better of course of my own case and I obtain the whole of my livelihood as a fisherman
I know very well that the people send home assistance to their parents here but I believe the greater portion of their livelihood is taken from the sea round this coast here
Yes
Yes there may be perhaps one or two but I was only a young lad at the time it was considerably over twenty years ago it was not out of my township but out of the township of Balephuil
Since that time there was a boat with a crew of five lost at Skerryvore lighthouse twelve or fifteen miles off the shore here
When this great disaster occurred I was only a boy and I cannot very well remember but a brother of my own was drowned off the shore two years ago and my mother was a widow and there was nothing done on that occasion
I cannot very well tell I know that the paupers complain but that may very well happen without there being good ground for it
It is the nature of some of them to complain
Besides I am at the sea and dont know very well what may happen
Yes certainly
Yes very
I have
 I Alexander MLean  elder and crofter at Balameanoch Tyree humbly beg to bring before the Royal Commissioners the following facts and grievances and crave their attention and consideration to the poor circumstances unto which I have been reduced through the illtreatment I have received from time to time
About forty years ago I bought the first of my crofts for thesum of  sterling the yearly rental of which was at that time  sterling
I afterwards got possession of other two crofts but for one of them I had to pay  and for the other  before I was allowed to take possession of them these sums being equal to the yearly rental of the crofts
I held possession of the three crofts for a good number of years and although they were but small having been together I was able to live comfortably and was perfectly satisfied
But a few years ago the last two mentioned crofts were taken from me without either compensating me for improvements made or even giving me back my own money which I paid for them and this for the direct purpose of extending the ground of a stranger who is not content by reducing me into my present poor circumstances but who now uses all means to deprive me of my remaining one
The rent of my present croft is now  s  d as compared with  thirty years ago or upwards of  per acre of poor soil
I have now so little land and what I have is so dear that I would be utterly unable to fight against poverty were it not for the support I get from my children in the Lowlands
My prayer is that I should get back my two crofts and that the rent of the other one should be reduced to the old standard and were this prayer answered I would be perfectly content and fairly comfortable
I bought it as I stated from the outgoing tenant
He went away to America at that time and he had the right to sell the croft and everything that was upon it
There were two horses and one cow of stock and there were the crops and houses and when I valued the amount I paid him  and when I valued the amount of seed and labour that he expended upon the croft for that year and the houses I considered I was over  out of pocket beyond the value of everything that I received
Yes it included the stock crops and houses
There was no valuation
They were not much worth  they were in a very backward condition and I had to repair them and put them in order again and I believe they were not worth as much as I expended in putting them in repair
Yes
I bought it in order to have a dwelling there and that I should cultivate it myself afterwards
From the factor of the day
It was other two men that had the crofts that I had before
One of them removed voluntarily to take up the croft his father possessed before and the other one left I dont know why or how
Yes it was two crofters occupied that before
They were given to the British Seaweed Company
They cultivate it
They keep it in their own hands
Well I cultivated them then they were drained but they were drained at the factors orders and his expense j but I paid interest all the time I was in possession of the crofts
There were fences and I kept them in repair
The manager of this seaweed company
He wanted to get the only one I have
The factor told me
I cannot tell that I did not ask that
I cannot say very well
Of course I did not know that I was in danger of losing those that I lost
But what I particularly wish now is to get them back again
Well they have another place
Oh yes but it is very small I consider it far too small
If it was large enough I would not ask these crofts back
Yes
They cultivate them
They must have considered that themselves anyhow before they asked them or got them
My opinion is that they might have done without them
Their allegation is that they required them in order to feed the horses necessary for their work  but they had two crofts before these and they might have fed their horses upon these
I believe in a sense they do some good to some of the people at least
They employ some of the people they keep a store where they provide goods for the people
The wages do not seem large and the people complain of it
With goods
It is likely that they make profit off the goods and that they prefer to give goods rather than money
They complain that they are dear
I believe they may be about as good as are going but when they pay in money they only pay half
For a ton of kelp they only give  in ready money but they give  worth of goods
I really cannot tell
There is only one other tenant and myself and this company in the whole township
He has his two crofts still he was not deprived of any of them but I believe he complains of the high rent
No the township has the old hill pasture
I have
 To the Royal Commissioners Highlands and Islands
I represent the small crofters of Caolis Ruaig and Salum who complain of
There might perhaps be about twelve acres of arable land in addition to the outrun but in some cases the outrun has been apportioned along with the arable ground the acreage in this case is larger of course
Short of twelve perhaps
I am afraid not there is a good deal of the land within the arable area that is rocky and unsuited for cultivation and that is counted of course in the acreage
To make a crofter comfortable probably he would require about twentyfour acres
Yes besides the outrun
The ground is so poor and gives forth such poor crops that I think we could scarcely maintain much stock upon all the arable land that we do plough just now
Thirty years ago perhaps
There are many examples of highhandedness down to the present day but some of them are specified in the other papers sent in today and those who sent them in are more capable of speaking of them
But this highhandedness does continue
Twentyone bolls per family this year in the township of Caolis but this year is exceptional
Yes we grind some barley some yearsvery little
Some of us make none at all
They have more than enough to do after feeding the stock to sow down crop again some of us have to buy seed
The greater number give to the cattle the whole of the barley and oats
Of course the potatoes always go to the family but there are others who send something to the mill
Two
Yes
Perhaps fifty to sixty barrels in an average year off an average croft some more some less
They are always sold out of the island more or less but there has scarcely been any sold out of our township the last four years
Yes we would
Probably between thirty and forty barrels
That would depend of course upon the number of the family but it is an average
It has not entirely ceased yet
In Mr Campbells time it was twelve days and it got less and now there may be a few days now and again  it has not yet ceased
We do not complain of it now
Any kind of work
We were once obliged to put up a fence between two large tacksa stone wall six feet high
We had to do the whole work quarry the stone  carry and all
I built it
Yes unless it may begin again
Not out of the large tacks but they were taken off some other crofts that were consolidated into one and they were removed as matter of favour to the sitting tenant and made to settle down upon the smaller crofters holdings
Yes
I and three neighbours had a piece of outrun attached to our arable ground and four crofters who were removed from their holdings were settled down upon this outrun of ours
There were instances of sitting upon an individual croft
A man who was a bachelor and who had no one to look after but he was in favour with the factor
He is not living now
There was only one croft although there were three families upon it
Two of them were in the rentbook and one was a cottar
They were moving to make room for him and sent off upon our land
No
Yes they belonged to the place
 s
Ten or twelve acres of arable ground two horses one of them only about a year old three cows a quey two stirks two sheep
The place is rather fully stocked the croft would scarcely feed them well
There is a portion of outrun to some extent but principally rocky and five of us have the right to put stock upon it
One of us only puts a horse upon it
Probably thirty or forty acres rock and all
No nothing that is all The outrun of the other crofts is allotted to each croft separately
Yes
Probably it is much about the same  some may be cheaper
Well perhaps it is
Perhaps some of the large farmers may be dearer than the crofts but take them all round considering their extent I should say the crofting communities are as highly rented
I think considering the stock it keeps it is dear enough at half the present rent
I fix the rent in proportion to the amount of stock the croft can provide for
We practically take little out of the produce of the croft itself
It is the outcome of the stock that provides our rent and the value of the croft
I look upon it this way  the horses are employed for cultivating the croft and we take no profit out of them so we do not count them in making up the rent
I would set apart perhaps s or s for each cow
I can scarcely admit that it is unprofitable
We cannot do with one horse the ground is light and sandy and some of it mossy  it must be ploughed quick and sown when it is ploughed
One horse wont do and unless we have a horse we cannot have the crops at all
I tried it and we could not get on with it  not but we agreed well enough but we would be behind hand with the work
No the two horses would cultivate more land equally well as the present croft
There is a great difference
The neighbour may have other work to do with the horse when I would like it to plough
It may be he is carrying seaware when I would like to be at the plough
Yes
Yes I know it  but I live upon one end of it and there is some portion of the other end I dont know so well
It is decreasing
Yes there was once about  people and now it is short of
Probably there is about half the island
There are some of these large farms that have crofters still within their bounds but a considerable portion of the old boundary of the township has been added to the tack
Scaranish Baliepheatrish Cornaigmore Hough Grianal Hynish Cruaidhghoirtean Crosspool Reef
There are several others where the place was only partially cleared and a large tack formed of the portion that was cleared and a few of the crofters stud remain on the outskirts of the place
I dont know that there is more than a family on each farm
Yes
Two of them are natives of Tyree
The factor has two Mr MQuarrie has two and Mr Barr has two
Yes they are resident in one of the places
Hough Hylipool or Cruaidhghoirtean
Some of those places were cleared before my recollection some since
I live upon one end of the island and could not tell the population but there are others coming after me who can
In some of the townships that was the case they were the better of it but in the great majority of them they were nothing the better of it the cleared lands were added to or made into tacks
Yes we are and the reason is that we pay higher rents and the crofts are not so good as they used to be in the days of our fathers
I think it was greatly to their loss because some of those who were removed were added in and crowded upon the small crofters and their places made less
That is the truth according to my judgment
Well perhaps it generally may be said to be better laud but anyhow it looks very much better because a great portion of it is not under cultivation and therefore the pasture is good and the portion of it that is arable can be cultivated upon a better system and yields better crops than we in our small crofts are able to raise
Yes I can tell you some of those townships out of which the people were sent away
Out of Scaranish went ten crofters
Then there is another tack not named before Baugh where some crofters still remain five crofters were sent out of it
Another place that was added on to the farm of Balliepheatrish eight crofters were sent from it
It was called Kennoway
Out of Hylipool twentysix crofters were removed and twentyone cottars
There were nine crofters and three cottars cleared from Balephuil and this portion added on to the farm of Hynish
Those four crofters were removed from a piece of land which was given to the British Seaweed Company
There is another tack Manal where there is still crofts but twentynine crofters were removed from a portion of it that is a large farm now
Chiefly from Glasgow
In old times we used to send to the mill almost as much as would feed the family in many cases where now we do not send a grain
No
Yes there are a few that find direct employment from this and there are others that manufacture kelp and they are obliged to sell it to this Seaweed Company they are not allowed to sell it to anybody else
No it was neither the one nor the other but because the Company rented the shore from the proprietor and accordingly they have the right to purchase at a price fixed by themselves all the kelp manufactured on the island
There is a statement bearing upon that among the papers sent in
So far as I know they do not make better wages
You cannot manufacture kelp except for a few weeks whereas those in the employment of the Company are employed all the year round
The greater portion of them would have been sent away some thirty years ago but upon a change of factorship in the place about twenty years ago some more were removed
There might have been a few cases since that time but not to speak of
Yes
Perhaps they have given away money once or twice but they wont pay any money if they can help it
Yes
Yes a great many
Yes but we wish to say something before that
We wish to know whether it it true that an assurance is being given to crofters and cottars in giving their evidence before this Commission from proprietors and factors

I am local factor to his Grace the Duke of Argyle
No I cannot give any such assurance
I did not ask for it and I was not told to give it
I would say the Duke of Argyle wont do anything against any man who will tell the truth
I am not going to say that
No we do not complain of that at all
We think that this is an indication on the part of the proprietor that he is willing to hear and redress our grievances
That is our understanding of it
st We have been deprived about thirty years ago by John Campbell Esq the then factor of the island of a part of Ben Hynish which from the time of our forefathers belonged to the common pasture of the township of Balephuil thereby reducing the stock on each croft by one horse one cow and one stirk less
DONALD MDOUGALL delegate
Nothing
That is so
Yes we do  but that is through the good will of the person who got the ground
There was a gate erected to prevent our passage for fear of spoiling the grass
That gate was closed and we were not allowed to pass
He did not keep the seaware from us but he did not wish us to go trespassing through his ground spoiling the grass
We have no other way but that of getting to the shore and getting seaweed
Yes we do
We do not because it belongs to ourselves if we get it out
Plenty
I dont know who made it but we measured it
It is a made highway from quay to quay
We pay our rates for the general public highways and we keep up this road besides with our own labour although it is entirely outside the boundaries of our farm
I believe it comes up to about twenty days a year for each crofter with a horse and cart nearly that anyhow
Yes
Yes
It may be ten days one year and twenty or more than twenty another year
No
Yes it was twice raised
I keep two cows and two horses
I have no young cattle at present
No  no crofter in the island has sheep
 s
Sixteen acres
I cannot tell that
It is not large now since we were deprived of a part of it
Yes it is useful to the country side
It leads to the quay
No one else does or has ever done any work upon that road but us
It is for fishermen
It was originally built for our township but it is often used by people from all parts of the country who run in there in bad weather
In connection with this quay I have to mention that nine crofters and some cottars who had their lands near this quay were moving to another part of our hill pasture
The pretext that was used for taking the hill pasture from us was those nine cottars that were moving from the quay
The place was cleared and now when we go upon a rough day there is no person to hold a rope
Yes some even since that time there was all that number and there have been some since
They belonged to our own township
There were some that came from the outside as well
Some of those came from some ground cleared by the factor to make a farm for himself
It was the tacks man of Hynish who got it from us and now Mr MQuarie has got it
One of the tacksmen of the place
Yes he has two large tacks
That this factor that cleared our place thirty years ago got the management of the property but ordained a statute like that of the Medes and Persians that no one should have either a sheep or a pig for fear that these sheep of ours would break in upon the large farms
He went round also among us holding a paper in the one hand and a notice to quit in the other and he told us that unless we signed this paper the effect of which was that we would require to be obedient to anything and everything which either he or the Duke of Argyle would order us to do we would have to quit the place
We signed the paper otherwise we would have to quit
After we signed the paper his mode of procedure was to raise our rents excessively our idea being that he did not mean to raise our rents because he thought the place was worth the rents but because he thought he would get us to follow our neighbours to foreign places and give up the crofts
That day we would have signed ourselves out into the sea but that alternative was not put before us and what we wish now to bring under your notice is that while we live in a land of law and libertyit gladdens our heart that our country is a country of law and libertystill neither the law nor the liberty reached this estate
We were in a state of slavery and oppression
We have heard but we are not quite certain whether it is the case that it is the Dukes desire that those places which were cleared by the removal of our neighbours to foreign places and some to the sea should be distributed among us
If that had been the case it would have been good for usif such a policy had been pursued but it was not
Instead of that policy being pursued those vacant farms were consolidated into large farms
There are ten of them now upon the island and upon eight of these there were crofters in old timesbefore Mr Campbells day
I believe the smallest of them is about  the highest is about 
No
I am a native of Invernessshire a Highlander and I speak Gaelic
 The late Mr F
D
P
Astley bought the estate of Arisaig i n  with the view of building a residence and residing in a part of the country which he dearly loved
After the purchase he at once began to improve and develop the estate
A new mansion house was built with suitable offices and gardens at very considerable cost
I have been unable to ascertain the exact cost as the estate papers prior to  are not in my possession
It is however one of the finest residences in the West Highlands
At the same time he commenced to improve the tenants houses and to rearrange the estate having especial regard to the improvement and amelioration of the condition of the crofters and cottars
Substantial stone and lime and slated houses were built for most of the Back of Keppoch crofters and their arable land drained
Similar houses were built at Arisaig for the cottar class
Interest at an average rate of  per cent was charged on the former and the rents of the latter were fixed at a similar rate of interest on the cost of their new houses
When the estate was bought it was very populous
Being obviously more so than the land could support even with such assistance as he could give them he encouraged such of the crofters and cottars as were disposed to do so to emigrate their whole expenses in doiug so including outfits and everything requisite for their comfort being borne by him
I have been unable to ascertain how many emigrated but I understand that a good number did so
Mr Astleys intention was that crofts should not be of  a smaller size than a family could live upon in comfort and he aimed at every crofter on the estate having eventually a stone and lime and slated house
His son and daughter who afterwards succeeded him in the estate carried out the same policy and from time to time new houses are being built
Everything that could be thought of was also done to elevate the social position of the smaller tenants
Schools were erected at two places where none had previously been and the salary of one of the teachers is still paid by the proprietrix
A reading room has also been started in the village and entertainments of various kinds given in connection therewith
Prizes are also given for the best kept cottages gardens and the best cultivated croft
Direct communication between proprietor and tenants has ever been the rule of the estate and nowhere else throughout the whole Highlands has more kindly consideration been shown by the proprietors to their tenants than upon this estate and generally speaking the tenants appreciate and acknowledge the kind treatment they have always received from the Astley family
The population of Arisaig at the last census in S was  and is not decreasing
There are no large tenants on the estate a gradation of tenants having been what was aimed at
The following classification speaks for itself  Tenants paying over  under      Tenants paying over  and under     Crofters paying over  and under     Cottars on crofts    Cottars not on crofts    Cottages in village c paying   and upwards
It is believed to be about  acres
Yes including the two properties that is a mere approximation for we have no plan showing the exact acreage
I should fancy something like  acres
Originally
Yes but the deer forest is a very small affair
I have been present all through and have heard what they said
I should like to see every man of them better
I think wherever there are crofters there is more or less of poverty
I am afraid so
I am afraid from the nature of it that it would not divide among the crofters
I am not sure that any one said so exactly
I think they said they would like some of what is forest land but I am not sure that they said they would like any of what has been let to other tenants
Glen Beasdale and Rhu of Rhumach
I should like it myself
No doubt
Very good grass indeed
I am not aware as to that
Oh yes  every part of it
I dont think so
Not decreasing  it is pretty stationary according to the census tables
I could not say
I would rather not express an opinion
No I have not given very much attention to that
That was his opinion
No they emigrated themselves at his expense
The inducement was rather to go
I have been told that every one went with his own consent but I am aware people emigrated from the Highlands with extreme reluctance
That is so
That is quite possible  but I know the intention was to make them good so as to promote the comfort of the people
That is always a matter of opinion
I think a good house always adds to the comfort of the occupant
I have heard such an opinion expressed but never by a person who lived in such a house
Yes I think sixtysix
No doubt
No doubt
It is a very difficult thing to satisfy every person
I know that the proprietrix of this estate is exceedingly anxious to satisfy every aspiration which she considers reasonable
Naturally
No doubt they are of that opinion  but it is also right to add that Mrs Nicholson and her father and brother before her always listened to and considered fairly any representation by the crofters before coming to a conclusion themselves
That is so
That is so
I really cannot tell youit was before my factorship  but I have been told that probably onehalf of that would be for the benefit of the crofters
That is perfectly true
It is an abominable road  I have traversed it myself  but  from the nature of the country it is impossible to make a road  it is a physical impossibility
That is so
Precisely
No doubt that cannot go on always
It has all been spent
I should think not
I am not at liberty to tell you
The greater part of it was done before the period of my factorage and I cannot tell you from personal knowledge  but I have been told that the greater part was spent in the reclamation of the land
At the time Mr Astley purchased this estate the arable land was of the most limited character and of the worst description and almost everything that has been done upon it has been done by the Astley family
These figures represent the total expenditure upon the estate
I endeavoured to separate what was done upon the crofters land from what was done on the large farms and what for the proprietors own residence but unfortunately the books dont show it
It is impossible to trace some of the old books
I could not get anything beyond
That is so
I dont think it is desirable certainly
I can go almost any length you like but it is not desirable to have frequent changes
They were not voluntary but it was necessary to make them
It is not the case upon Arisaig
The under factor Mr Joseph Routledge
That constitutes a native I think
Ha was born and bred in it and never left it
That is his misfortune
Yes
I dont know I know his father is not a Highlander but he is an exceedingly clever man
I think so
And a Highlander I wish he had a Highland name
Since about five years ago
No
There are no other officials but myself and the under factor
I heard it with exceeding regret and as a member of the Parochial Board I must make inquiries about it
His duty is to come quarterly and I shall be exceedingly disappointed if I dont find out at the board meeting that he did not attend to his duty and there is a meeting tomorrow
There are two schoolsa Roman Catholic school and a Protestant school and the arrangement works very well
He has
He pays I think a rent of  he has a croft
He holds from the proprietor the same as an ordinary tenant
It has during my time as factor
I think so
I am not quite sure
The proprietor upon his return will consider most carefully everything that has been said today
What determination he will come to I cannot tell but I can say that both Mr and Mrs Nicholson will give it their most careful consideration and that their leanings will be towards improving the condition of the crofters
I have been endeavouring to calculate it from the Ordnance survey and it seems something like  acres
If anything can be done to keep them in it shall be done
It is more a sanctuary than a forest
Nothing else
Yes
Yes
I have no idea
No it is on the Kinloch Moidart part of the estate
They must be wild deer travelling over the country
I do not know but Mrs Nicholson was disposed to fence it and there was an arrangement that it should be fenced when a certain thing was done
There was was a small rent put on the tenants and as soon as they clear that I understand they will get that altered
Yes I have done it myself by letter
It is a small potato patch
No
Both private schools and the other school was started by the estate as a private school also but all under Government inspection
Seven
Yes there is
In the Argyleshire part of the parish the bulk of population are Protestants  in the Invernessshire part the great proportian are Roman Catholics
I should say  per cent are Catholics in the Invernessshire part of the estate
Speaking from recollection about three
In addition to the two private schools
No doubt
It consists of seven members
The proprietor of the estate of Ardnamurchan  Mr Dalgleish  Mr MLean of Glenuig myself Mr Coulter tenant upon the Ardnamurchan estate the parish minister the Moidart priest and the seventh I forget
There are two Roman Catholics
I really cannot say I know some of them are Roman Catholics but the board always shows an anxious desire to appoint a teacher of the religion of the majority of the people among whom they are to teach
As a matter of fact I cannot tell you from recollection my impression is that two out of the three are Roman Catholics
Women
I think so two at any rate
No none of them I think
It is governed by the conscience clause of the Act
I dont think the board have laid down anything
I think it is left to the teacher to carry out the use and wont of the locality
I know
To whatever comes in place of a catechism
They have given no instructions for or against it
Personally I am not aware that there is I never inquired
Yes
Yes
No I do not remember ever being present at the hour of religious instruction
I am not able to state whether or not any religious instruction is given
We pay very close attention to the secular instruction
No certainly not
So far as I know they are
The matter has never cropped up in this parish
The meaning of rule  altogether is to this effect that as the crofters housesthe slated houseshave been erected by the proprietor at his sole expense the last clause of the rule does not apply to those at all but solely to the thatched houses and it is thus that at present they get no value for the thatched houses if they remove
But that was considered hardly fair and it was thought they ought to get something and the rule was framed as it stands that twothirds of the valued price should be paid to the outgoing crofter by the incoming crofter or the proprietor at entry and the instructions to the valuator are that not more than three years rent is to be held as the value of a thatched house
I am quite sure the proprietor will be only too glad to alter it so as to make what is meant perfectly plain
The intention is that the house should be put in a state of repair by the proprietor at entry and that any subsequent repair is to be done at the mutual expense of the proprietor and tenant which is much more favourable than usual on many estates where they are called upon to keep everything in order after getting everything put right
Here all the subsequent repairs shall be at the mutual expense of the proprietor and tenant
That is so
It was always thought better on any estate with which I have had to do to have the estate rules printed so that the tenants may really know what they are
It is not kind to hamper a good tenant in any way But it is only for cases of difficulty that it is advisable to have a rule to fall back upon
I think it could
I never found any difficulty except upon this estate and I heard with regret that there were difficulties in understanding them
Quite common
It is
There is nothing more to do so far as I know
Mr Macdonell expended a great sum of money upon the improvement and development of the estate and it is pretty well improved and latterly there has been very little work to do
I know there are one or two small matters fencing and so on
I should think the reasons would be best known to the trustees themselves and they gave instructions not to expend any more
I know generally that probably there was a difficulty in finding money to go on with the improvement 
I am not aware of any such regulations on the Lochiel estate
Yes
That is so on the South Morar estate
I think there is a cessation of labour and it is more difficult for the people to pay their rents
There will always be something to do
I should doubt that it will be to the same extent as in the past
I am not aware but great changes were made during the proprietorship of Lord Cranstoun
No
Yes
Yes one or two
No doubt one or two of the places named are perfectly suitable
I suppose pasture ground especially
No doubt
Yes
I have a third of it
The place is not allotted out
The rent of the three is 
 s d each
The place is let to stock seven but in order to get an equal price we have three cows each
The place cannot support these we have to buy fodder for them
We are allowed to keep twelve sheep each but we have only about twelve among us
That is Laggan
The old rent was  but it was raised by   in Lord Cranstouns time
We do not complain of the rent nor do we complain of the proprietors we have had but we complain that we have too little land to subsist by
Well it is not for us to specify any particular portion of land but at the same time we are of opinion that if our township were given to two instead of three and the third man provided for elsewhere we would be much better off
There is plenty of land in the country where I saw people dwelling when I came first and where no man lives now
I should choose many a place before Ardnish
It is an inaccessible place
There is no road although we pay the road money and we have to go through the moor four miles before we can get at it I think the third man who would be removed from our township would gladly choose any other place on the estate rather than remain where he is
Nine to ten miles
Six miles of road and the rest is very bad moor
Glasgow Tobermory Fort William and passing vessels
By boats and in winter time when the weather is bad we require to hire carts to carry it away from the landing place of the steamer to Borrodale and by boat from there
We are on the sea coast
We would wish to get land but we would not like to ask anything that those proprietors whom we have had for the last thirtyeight years would not be inclined to give for they were very good to us
All over the country
Not upon this estate
One would like to look to his own interests first no doubt
I dont complain of the rent nor of the proprietor but I should like to have a little more land upon which to support my family
I can only provide for them for three months by my croft
Our best source of income is shellfish
We begin to gather whelks in autumn after the crops are cut and we continue until the spring and the whole place depends upon that source of income more than upon auythiug else now that we have lost driving and smearing sheep
We used to drive herds of cattle and sheep to Falkirk and other markets and sometimes to England and we sometimes made  or  by that in the season
That source of income is lost to us now since the railways were opened
We also used to smear sheep and that also has gone out of fashion
There is only one man smearing now for every twelve that used to be
They are under a shepherd with perhaps one or two attendants who can drive the stock to Banavie and then they ship them from there and sometimes they drive them to Tyndrum and put them upon the Oban railway or Kingussie upon the Highland line
Twentyeight years ago some of them were employed at it  but many of the people only took to that mode of getting a living after every other occupation failed them
Yes you wont gather d worth now where you could gather s d worth five years ago
Yes but it is very hard work for the men
They dont complain of it so much
During the five or six days of a spring tide one works well to earn about s
I was appointed to see that everything was properly arranged and that those who were to make general statements appeared in time and properly prepared
I have only been two years here and dont profess to know very much about the people except by having had a meeting with them about these matters at which I took down notes from the most of them
Most of the papers were composed by me from what the people told me and contain no representations of my own
With the people
They did
No except when Mr Murdoch came here on Saturday last and we happened to have two meetings when he came and he was present
He went along with me but he was not asked  and the people did not know he was to be there
No
They had met before he came
No these regidations were issued at Whitsunday and have not been in operation
No
No
Two years
Some of them about twenty years ago
Yes or thirty when a number of families were sent away
Thirty years ago one hundred and twenty families were sent away to America and elsewhere
No but they have heard rumours that they were to be evicted
My own impression is that it is because there is no work for them on the estate and that those who wished to send them away thought it was for their good that is my own explanation of it
No
Yes generally people buying estates who have no interest in them so far as their connections are concernedEnglish people who buy Highland estates
Not necessarily
I could not say the families were were better
I could not say except that strangers have generally been chosen for this estate
They dont belong originally to the place
Some of them English
Not the least
No
I mean deer
Yes
Decidedly
The last part of the rule I cannot interpret it is put indefinitely but it would give you to understand that no son was to be allowed to remain
Yes
They dont object at all to going away but they object to being told to go away
They want to go away and get work and they consider that none of them will remain as long as it is for their good to go away  but they think it hard that there should be a law compelling them to do that although they know it is for their good
Yes very much
It is a bad thing for them to remain
But that regulation puts them all on the same level
It is given to those who send their children away as well as to those who would keep them  and it would be far better to examine the houses and enforce the rule where and when it was really necessary
I object to its being said to every one that he must send his children away although I consider it a good thing for them to go away
I think they would if they got the chance
Certainly
I dont understand it
These regulations are new and have not been enforced and they have been objected to
The people delayed the payment of rent on account of these regulations  and there would not have been so much about that had they not been in correspondence with Mr Nicholson about them
He said he might modify rule  for them and they understood he was to enforce all the rest without modification
That is the great objection to them
It is not at all known
Craignish
No they are not inferior
Yes
They dont sell many things they fish and sell herring
Yes stirks
Yes of late years
It depends very much upon whether the fish are plentiful or not
In a plentiful year they get very little for them after great trouble and when there is little they are almost at starvation in a middling year they are more comfortable
Yes
No
No
Yes
I think not
To Loch Hourn
I am not aware
Some young men do
I dont know
Not quite
They go to service
Occasionally
They have the croft here is their home and they come home when they are out of work
Yes in my experience they do
As satisfactory as any parish I know
Nothing to speak of
Yes
One
Yes and it is extremely well conducted
Yes
It occurred to me in this light that the farmer was rich and could do for himself at any time of the year but the crofter and cottager are generally poor and it is therefore a greater hardship to them than to the farmer to be sent away at short notice
I could not say perhaps the crofters pay it oftener
I cannot say
Yes some of them have good houses
It is partly
They tell me that their crofts would be too dear although they had not to pay any interest and some of them say the interest itself is quite sufficient rent
No of course not
Yes I think so
But in regard to the proprietor not being able to do it of course not but that dont make it easier for the tenant to pay it
They dont blame the proprietor at all
The proprietor of course cannot do it for nothing but when it is built interest has to be paid which in addition to the rent of the croft becomes difficult to pay
That the rent should be reduced so that even paying the interest of the house along with it it should be a fair rent
If that way were takeneither the one way or the other
No but I think it is reasonable that they should let it at its real value
Some of them say so
Some of them pay  every year and they say it is sufficient for their croft
They have I think only four cows
Well I could not say I am sure
No but I think he should be
No but I consider he is bound morally to let them live at a reasonable rate on the estate
I dont say exactly what he should do for them 
It is so supposed but it is not the case
He pays his rent from the fishing there are cases in which the cows have all died and the people have had nothing
Now if the proprietor discovered that the man would be sent away because he had no money to deposit and if the proprietor would allow him time he might get his rent from the fishing
Perhaps
Yes
A person of the name of Angus Campbell lost a cow and had only another which he also lost recently
Having lost the first cow should the proprietor say  You have only one cow you must go
The man may be a carpenter and he might make money by his trade and be able to pay the proprietor at the end of the year and I think it is unreasonable that he should be asked to deposit the rent before it is due
He does not know that the tenant shall live to get the value of it
The money should be in the bank to the credit of the tenant who may die
It is on that assumption that the rule is made
No but no one knows what proprietor may come and if these rules are in force who knows that there may not be two fools as on the estate of Morar
If a fool should come and if these rules should remain we do not know what might happen
The present proprietor is right and just we consider but we dont know who may come in his place and enforce these rules
There was something about that
It may be
These dogs were destroyed
The fact is I really do not know when I heard of any sheep worrying but I have heard of dogs being poisoned when they went astray
No I did not hear it
No I objected to a distinction being made between the leaseholder and the crofter
It may be so
Yes but it has not gone the length that it should do
Certainly but we are here today to get further advances and to get the law so made that so long as we pay fair rent we shall not be removed at all
Yes that they are too minute and that there are so many regulations concerning it that really a tenant cannot undertake it for a small bit of land
Yes
Yes but I think these regulations are too minute
Yes but he has to be sole judge
Yes but we cannot compel him to do so and the man he might send might be worse than himself
That is what I consider so absurd
He might not
It is to prevent that that we are here to object to the paper to prevent his going headlong into things he knows nothing about
Yes they were raised by the factor who was here some years ago and he said unless they would give him  more rent they would all be evicted and it is remarked that he said he would give it to a Frenchman sooner than let them have it unless they gave him more rent
He came and said You will have to go out
Now I consider a bargain is between two
No of course not
Yes when he remains
I am not definite on that point I dont know
In some cases the proprietors give them money to emigrate and I think if that money which was given to them for emigration was given to stock and get a croft at home it would be a good change on that policy
Yes of course they have no right to get it from anyone unless they are good enough to give it
Government might perhaps lend money
Yes
Yes but if the proprietor would be willing to do it I should say it would be better
That is the general impression
Certainly
They dont take for granted
No it is based on a knowledge of the fact that people have been so
Yes
No
Yes but generally speaking I dont think any person requires these I mean the people on the estate
Yes
Yes I asked them everything that I put into the paper
I dont consider them fair
Yes but there are others far more competent to speak of that
Yes
Yes
Yes
Not necessarily
No but that was not exactly because he was English
Even a Scotsman
No
There were a great many of the proprietors here who were not for the benefit of the people especially the managers that they had
Not the slightest so far as I know
I wont answer that question if you please except to say that the management has been very bad  but I dont sav that they do it consciously with a will against the Highlanders
Yes
Certainly they must go away
Yes
Yes certainly
The rules would illustrate that
Yes
I cannot speak distinctly to that but I think that is so
Even that is quite inadequate  of course a few days was ridiculous
I cannot speak to that In Strath the people have no cattle they are householders without land
I forget but they get no milk except what they buy
One or two have a cow
I dont think there is
Certainly
Yes
No not satisfactory
I could not say there was distinctly more  it might be a little more
There was a case in which it was commonly said the woman died of starvation but there are people here who can speak to that better than I
If it is so I think it was the fault of the inspector of poor
Mary OHenley
In February last
It was commonly said
The constable took some steps but it didnt go far on
I think he wrote to the fiscal
No the policeman examined some people
No

The township of Back of Keppoch contains in all ten and a half lots or crofts of about five arable acres each onethird of which is kept as pasturage
The average rent on each lot is  s
The average number of cattle on each lot is four cows
The rental of our township is  s
About fortyone years ago our rent was raised on an average by  on each lot and the most of our hill pasture was taken from us and having no place to keep part of our cattle we had to part with them for less than half their value
About twentyone years ago  s were added to the rent of each lot in name of interest on money expended on houses and drains a sum which we believe to be a full rent in itself
When our rent was raised last the proprietor gave us plenty of employment and consequently we did not feel the hardship to be so great
We have now nothing to depend on but the crofts and the fishing
For want of hill pasture mortality among our cattle is very great
We lose an average of four cows every year
The loss at times falls on one man at other times we share it
The soil is poor and sandy and in many instances gives no corn
If we sow a boll of corn where we had potatoes the previous year the return very often will not exceed three bushels
We have made no meal for the last thirty years
Manure consists chiefly of seaware which we carry on our backs
If we would keep a horse one croft would not carry more than the horse and one cow so that it is evident a croft is too dear at  s
About fortytwo years ago sixteen families were evicted from the farm of Kinloyd which is now in the hands of one man
These were restored by next proprietor
About thirty years ago they were again removed
Some of the evicted were obliged to emigrate and others were sent in among us

At last payment of rent the present proprietor gave us new regulations which we considered so hard that at the time we delayed payment of rent

We will give you a printed copy which we hope you will have the goodness to look into and print in your report
What we wish done for us is that we will get the land we at present possess at its real value that the rent be fixed by land commissioners appointed by Government or that the land be otherwise fairly valued that all the land which was taken from our township be restored and that we be not removed so long as we pay a fair rent
Seeing that our forefathers have been here from time immemorial we consider that we have as much right to live in comfort here as the proprietor has to be superior over us
As to emigrationwhat land has a greater right to sustain us than the land for which our forefathers suffered and bled
Why should we emigrate
There is plenty of waste land around us for what is an extensive deer forest in the heart of the most fertile part of our land but waste land
And there is far too much of that here
The best part and almost the whole of this estate is partly in the hands of three farmers and partly a deer forest
The deer forest itself once land flowing with milk and honey which supported scores of families in comfort but who alas 
are now on the account of the mania for sport scattered over the wide world is far better than all the land now cultivated by the poor crofters
Although some of us have good houses there are others who have very bad onesso bad that on stormy nights they cannot rest for fear they will fall upon them
We wish that instead of those houses good ones may be built
We pay road money regularly yet the road which passes through our township has never been repaired and it is in very bad condition

The township of Back of Keppoch contains in all ten and a half lots or crofts of about five arable acres each onethird of which is kept as pasturage
The average rent on each lot is  s
The average number of cattle on each lot is four cows
The rental of our township is  s
About fortyone years ago our rent was raised on an average by  on each lot and the most of our hill pasture was taken from us and having no place to keep part of our cattle we had to part with them for less than half their value
About twentyone years ago  s were added to the rent of each lot in name of interest on money expended on houses and drains a sum which we believe to be a full rent in itself
When our rent was raised last the proprietor gave us plenty of employment and consequently we did not feel the hardship to be so great
We have now nothing to depend on but the crofts and the fishing
For want of hill pasture mortality among our cattle is very great
We lose an average of four cows every year
The loss at times falls on one man at other times we share it
The soil is poor and sandy and in many instances gives no corn
If we sow a boll of corn where we had potatoes the previous year the return very often will not exceed three bushels
We have made no meal for the last thirty years
Manure consists chiefly of seaware which we carry on our backs
If we would keep a horse one croft would not carry more than the horse and one cow so that it is evident a croft is too dear at  s
About fortytwo years ago sixteen families were evicted from the farm of Kinloyd which is now in the hands of one man
These were restored by next proprietor
About thirty years ago they were again removed
Some of the evicted were obliged to emigrate and others were sent in among us

Very well

Yes and I remember it
I think it was just for a lift of money the money was wanted on the proprietors side

Yes by us crofters
No

I would think so
Certainly it was by the crofters themselves
Exactly
Some more people coming in got some of our land and they had to pay rent to that extent to the factor
Yes
Not very far distant
They came from some other places
It is in the hands of one man principally at present
Yes
A sheep farmer
Yes
Yes but it was the best of our pasturage
It is let to another tenant who keeps sheep it is also added to the sheep farm
From this place which is occupied by the sheep farm at present
Yes and he is paying rent to the proprietor
No
We have different witnesses
Yes the proprietor
Mr Macdonuell South Morar
Yes it never was fulfilled
We dont put that question to them
We are making the complaint
They gave no reply whatever
Yes
He does not know whether that was the case or not
We petitioned him telling him the state we were in at present and the low rent we were paying in  and the manner in which the rent had been increased
We asked him to do something for us and he said nothing to that
It is given to other tenants and paid for to the proprietor
No it is given to the tenants
With the exception of one I believe not
That is so
There will be about three or four acres so far as I can calculate

If they have too little they have to pay six months rent forehand
They go to London
s or s per bag
The women and the men if the herring fishing fails them
We have no other work
A woman would gather about a bag in a week
She could save say s in the week
It is and they can only gather them when the tide is out
There may only be five days in a fortnight when they can gather them
Yes
We get it from the large farmers who have sheep and so on
Yes
No in the majority of cases we can that is if we have the money to pay for it
Yes but the best of it was taken from us
Yes pretty convenient although it is very inferior
Yes we got that from the first proprietor Mr Macdonnell and we asked our present proprietor to do some of it but he would not do it
No  our first proprietor Mr Macdonnell was keeping up the fence for us
No it is not
Well the proprietor did it for the township I am here representing
Well I would perhaps conditionally
I believe we would
Any kind to keep out sheep and deer and our own cattle from our crops
But I say the reverse it was kept up by our former proprietors
It gave way after having stood for twenty years
Wood
No we never came to any understanding
No it was made of wood
Stones can be got too but it would cost far too much to bring stones to the place
No there would be very few anyhow
Yes on account of the rent being so heavy I think he should do this
No
Not unless ourselves were doing it
Some of us do
They dont do us any harm in the township I am here representing
I understood part of it
I think my friend has said all that we had to say
There has been no work on the land on which we are for the last eight years
The proprietor we had at that time was keeping us in work
Mr Macdonnell
He gave all the work he had on the lands
Colin Macdonald
Fourteen
Yes
No
No
Connected with it
No
We could not live by that we are dependent upon the herring fishing and if it fails we have recourse to the whelk gathering
Yes
Yes we all follow that it is the only thing we have had to depend upon for the last eight years
It has been
No
I think our worst time is just now
Formerly we got work from the proprietor and the fences were kept up and wood was given to us
Fences between the arable land and pasture
We did
We lost almost all we had and we got no assistance from anybody
We spoke of it to those who were relieving the country to see if they could do anything for us but nothing was done
Yes
We did manage to do it although we had to suffer on some other side by doing that
We had
Yes but we sold some of what we had ourselves to better ourselves by getting a change of seed
I believe our factor is prepared to answer that
There was a shop here which bought and sold potatoes
Although we sold some we bought twice as much
No
We shift it as often as we think it is to do us good
They require a great deal of manure and seaware for the ground is poor sandy and mossy part of it
Yes we do
Yes
No  because they are so far away from us and we would have great difficulty in taking them to our byres because our ground is so small that we cannot keep horses or anything
Sand and seaware
Sometimes we do when we think that fishing is going to benefit us
Well every fisherman has a good idea of how the fishing is as it were going to come on
We do
Very little in cod and ling but some years we are very successful in the herring fishing particularly the last two years
We were very successfulpretty successful
Just sometimes we dont go very often
We do if we think we can make any money by it
Just middling not extra good  but in our present stateso very poor we are glad to utilise every kind of fishing although we rely more upon the herring fishing
His reverence Mr Macallum has them in his hand I believe
One rule is I believe that   All leases shall be for a period of fifteen years with a mutual break at the end of the seventh year unless otherwise agreed upon with a years written notice to quit
This notice to be alike available for proprietor as for tenant and is also to apply to breaks
For crofts where there is no lease the notice to quit shall be six months and for cottages without land attached three months
I cannot understand these rules at all
They were formed by a lawyer and put in such a way that he could get out of the responsibility
It would be better for me to say I do not understand them at all
No I dont really
I never read these rules because they were frightening me I was told they were that bad
I did not even glance at them
I was told I would not understand them they were done in such a way by the lawyer that he could get out this way and that way
Intelligent people
They referred me to this that the house was to be put into good order before the tenant entered
It does not say who will have to put them in order that is one thing
I never read them in my life
They did not say they were not worth reading
No
They said they were done by a lawyer in such a way that so many questions would require to be asked before a man could understand them
I dont like to name any individual party but I know they were good scholars
I never glanced at the rules myself because none of them ever were in my possession
I had not even an opportunity of  going over them
We drew a line under those we did not like
I may say I have been consulting with the Rev
Mr Macallum about them for he understands them much better than I do  and certainly he was reading them to me and marked those that were not going to suit us  but I did not read them myself
Yes

That is so
It is
My early recollection of the village is that the population forty years ago was much larger than it is at present
Yes shiploads
Arisaig in particular
There is some difficulty in explaining that because there were may be thirty families to be evicted from that part of the Arisaig estate now a deer forest and Mr Macdonells mother was so kind as to take them to South Morar over to her own side for a year and keep them there but after that when she was unable to support them they were obliged to goto scatter anywhere
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
It was done in some such way as this they were cramped into a small place by overcrowders coming in as I have shown but I dont think any of them were evicted
Well I cannot say that they were evicted from so small an estate against their consent
I dare not speak about Arisaig
Very poor
It has stopped all work
Perhaps he is for all I know
His name is Nicholson  he may be a Skye man I believe he is
Because he is our proprietor
He married Miss Astley and that is the way we call him the proprietor

Yes I consider myself better off than they are
Yes if they only got them a little cheaper
There is no place in the whole country dearer than our place
I show an old receipt of date  for  on account of rent
Yes my father paid  of rent for his croft and it was well worth that
There were four of them and they each had ten milk cows and near about one hundred sheep each
They left it twenty years ago
They were forced out
No the old man explained what became of them they removed here and there
Yes we want more land and now that the proprietor has plenty of land in his own hands and is wishing to let it we do not see very well why he should not give it out to those of us who could afford to take it when we would be willing to pay at the same rate of rent as the large farms
Eilanreoch
I would take about  or  acres
Between  and 
Yes
Thereabout
I would be quite willing to do that
Three were ejected from this place in order to make room for us when we went there and some would be only too glad to get back even at the present day
He never got any assistance at that time although no doubt it gave them a heavy blow
Still they had sufficient means to be able to do without assistance and if they had been left in the land they would have been able to hold it
They were not a penny in arrears
Yes
Yes
About twelve milk cows and one hundred sheep and horses
No
Yes
Yes one of them the other two were not so good
My father was born in Swordlan and he was removed to this place but his two grandfathers were in this same township to which he himself was afterwards removed
Yes
No
I cannot say
No
No
We have been here for at least five or six generations
Yes but the delegate didnt mention the other side of the glen
There is a river coming down through the glen and the other side is mostly the same as the big side
The other side of the glen could be peopled quite as well
I remember myself of a few tenants who were there at one time
I have a chair in my house which was made out of a portion of the timber of a house which was burned at the time Prince Charles went through the country
That shows that my people have been in the country for a long time
Was that the old house of your grandfather
No not a penny
We were only a year or two in the place when we saw that they thought to remove us again
By that time we had the dwellinghouse and offices built
No we were not
They tried to remove me again last year
This decree was not executed
I went to the factor and saw him and he told me to go away home and I would get leave to stay as long as I paid my rent
Last Whitsunday he went and took down the very fence I put up myself saying that I had more land than my neighbours
This was about the land I reclaimed myself
His manager measured it out three times and upon each occasion he found a different measurement
When the proprietor died last year I got an invitation to the funeral along with many others and I and one or two of the smaller tenants went to the funeral and very shortly afterwards the factor gave me this paper and attempted to eject me
They wanted us to make a club stock of the sheep
He wished to eject me evidently because I was of the old stock of the land
Yes
My name is Donald Stewart blacksmith and crofter Little Galder
About sixtyfive years ago all this glen was inhabited there being twelve or thirteen townships
All these were deprived of their holdings
The most of them emigrated to America
The rest of them were put close together near the seashore namely Galder
There were about twenty crofters in Galder having an acre or two acres each of arable land with hill pasture for one or two cows and their followers but no sheep
At the time of the famine thirtyfour years ago these crofters petitioned the proprietor for assistance who gave them their choice of a free passage to America or to have their crofts free of rent till the famine ended but the then factor concealed from them the fact that they might have the land free for a time and thus they had no choice but to emigrate
Those that remained were in possession of Galder
About two years after the emigration Mr Mitchell the large sheep farmer who was very intimate with the factor and wishing to enlarge his farm asked the whole of Galder which the factor at once granted him much against the will of the people and of my father who had a large share in it and who reasoned with the factor about the loss the people suffered by taking the land from them and their rent paid
The factor gave no hearing to this but gave it to Mitchell and we believe all this was done quite unknown to the proprietor
Since then a person cannot get pasture for any beast in Glenelg unless he can get it in Skye
But still my father was left in possession of Little Galder for which he paid  of rent until he died twentytwo years ago
Then I succeeded him and paid the same rent
Sixteen years ago I reclaimed two and a half acres of land since then I built a barn byre and stable and built an addition to our dwelling house which my father built
I spent more money on the property than any other crofter in it
Five years ago the present factor Mr Mollison in June  took from me the largest half of my croft and charged me  s for the remaining half saying Mr Mitchell the farmer who had already twenty miles stretch of land by in some part adding townships together was offering  for it
I wrote to Mr Mitchell and reminded him of how his father took from us Big Galder and that I thought it a hard matter if he was again coveting the small piece left me by which I supported a large family and aged mother
He replied stating that he never asked any of my land
I showed Mr Mollison unwillingness to the alteration at which he became haughty saying he was commissioner of the estate and if I would say a single word he would take the whole from me and drew out a form in writing and made me sign it to that effect and promised me more land in a short time
Likely he was afraid the proprietor would hear of it of whom we had never any reason to complain for if the factors had acted according to his orders the crofters here would have been as well off as any in Scotland for it was a rule on the estate that the land was not to be taken from any man as long as he paid the rent
But as he was not coming to the place the factors did as they liked
The half taken from me would keep four cows from which I took a profit of between  and  a year
Next Whitsunday the factor mentioned that he would require to raise my rent again for he said the half given to Mitchell was worth only  s to him but he did not follow his demand
I  calculated on Mr Mitchells large farm which should contain upwards of  sheep at  rent the pasture of fifteen sheep which the half taken from me should keep would come to  s which it is worth to Mitchell and now of less value for it is already overgrown with rashes and coarse grass where I had good crops of corn potatoes and ryegrass
Many of my neighbours who have no land would thankfully give   for it
Being thus deprived of the best half of my croft I was unable to keep my family and mother in the same circumstances as formerly and became under the necessity of breaking an agreement made with my mother at my fathers death that I would support and give her a cows grazing as long as I could
This change made a great injury on my mother
I am not afraid of the factor this year
If I was as little afraid of him five years ago I would have my croft yet
We got a new proprietor who is very kind to the people and seeming to have a great interest in them and who will not we trust allow the same as the foregoing usages
My circumstances was now so much reduced that I had to begin the herring fishing
This is only one instance of many others of a far worse kind done to my neighbours and some of these carried on yet by Mr Mitchell
I have no pleasure in running down any person but merely to show how we are treated as slaves misrepresented and befooled continually that suffering under these grievances
We want as much land as will keep us comfortable which is our inheritance at a fair rent that the Government would buy good slices of these sheep runs going into waste for want of cultivation and stock that we pay the rent to  Government so as to enable us to look upon ourselves as free men for we are tired of this tyranny
Another of my neighbours who has a large family and aged father and mother dependent on him has a cows pasture on Mr Mitchells sheep pasture for which he charges  s
The man asked to be allowed to keep the calf for which he offered s more to enable him to pay the pasture
This was refused  the man complained and said he was afraid ho would require to sell the cow for the wintering with the pastnre was too heavy on him
Mr Mitchell replied that was what he liked
So there is no sympathy with the aged or infant sheep and the love of money is the whole go and so on with every other person
I do
One man got an acre or two free and he was telling that he had been paying no rent for years
We go to Skye with any beasts we like to keep
We dont get pasture in Glenelg we have to go to Skye
Yes
About s for a oneyearold and s for a twoyearold
There are a good many of them who cannot stock their land fully and are happy to get beasts to pasture
Half a year
Two years old
 to 
Yes
Two
One
None
About twelve acres between arable and pasture
 s about     between taxes and everything else
Yes
Slated
The proprietor helped us with the slates the lime and the timber and we had the workmanship to do masonry carpentry and slater work
I believe I spent more than   upon it
He would have spent as much more upon the dwelling house
Yes
No
Yes
I dont believe he would but I am not sure
Well the proprietor was a kind man and we had confidence in him
Yes
More on the croft there is only a very little blacksmith work going on in the place
Yes but they are doing very little work requiring a blacksmith
I want the part of my croft which was taken from me back again
Yes
Rattagan and Bealary farm
I suppose it is but I am not very certain
I am not sure
I have not heard that said
Statement in behalf of the Township of Galder Glenelg
The inhabitants of the district of Galder Glenelg wish to say to the Royal Commissioners that in their district there are seventeen families consisting of eighty souls ten of whom are paupers
Seven families of these have not an inch of ground except what their houses stand on
Their houses were erected by themselves and they pay a ground rent of five shillings a year for their stances
Six families have from one to four acres each
The fences surrounding their land have been put up by themselves but as they cannot afford to lay out money on wire fences to the extent required their crops are much injured by the sheep of the farmers whose land surrounds them
Two of the crofters kept dogs for a short time to help to keep off the trespassing sheep but the farmer sent them word that unless they sent away their dogs he would get them turned out of their crofts
These have to say however that the farmer has given them wire this summer with which they intend as soon as it can be done to improve their fences
The district of Galder over thirty years ago was wholly occupied by crofters when they had the whole of the hill pasture and so were able to keep a sufficient number of cattle to provide milk for their families
Now only three of the seventeen families are able to feed their cow on their own croft
Three others have a cow each for which they have to pay   to the  farmer for hill pasture
Owing to the unnecessary shutting up of an old road which existed from time immemorial these three cows have to be driven over two miles before they get to their pasture
If they come to the gate on this old road they are hunted by the farmers dogs to their great injury
This gate is not  yards from the crofters houses  and they consider it a great hardship especially when it does not interfere with any crop to have to drive their cattle such a round
One of the crofters said to the manager that he would lay this grievance before the Royal Commission
The reply was that neither he nor his master cared for the Royal Commission
These crofters trust that the Royal Commission will be the means of their getting their crofts added to so that they may be enabled to support themselves and their families decently
There is a good deal of land in the parish at present available for their purpose and they are willing to give a fair rent for any portion assigned to them
Another grievance which affects the whole parish is that there is no money order office and no telegraph office nearer than Lochalsh
The post road to Lochalsh is merely a sheep track over the hill and in wet weather it is absolutely dangerous owing to the boggy nature of the ground
The want of proper postal and telegraph communication is most felt during the herring fishing season when messages often cannot be sent in time to command a proper market for the herring thereby entailing great loss on the poor people many of whom go to Lochourn for the fishing
Yes
Mrs Macdonald the ministers wife wrote the first part
One of the scholars
Upon the first occasion I told Mrs Macdonald what to put down and she put it down in her own language and I dictated some to the boy and the boy put it down in his own language too
It is my own language
Yes
That is some of them who have more land than I and my neighbour have
We have only a small portion and our cows graze upon Mr Mitchells place and I had to sell my own because of the way it was being used by the shepherds and I have only a quey now
There are only two crofts that are fenced round the others have no fence to separate them from Mr Mitchells farm
Yes and they have got it in order to prevent the farmers sheep trespassing upon their arable ground with which they had been very much bothered
We have no common grazing at all
My neighbour and I have nothing except the grazing upon the farm and the other two have only the grazing within the fence
Yes
The pasture is near enough if he would only let us through that gate  it would only be  yards from the houses but he compels us to make a circuit of two miles to get to it
No he would not
I cannot tell no reason in the world unless that he would have better pasture for his sheep
We have to take them round a circuit of two miles morning and afternoon
He has reserve pasture within the fence and which he does not like us to go over and so he compels us to make the circuit
The public road is on one side and there is a gate but there is a rock and the cattle have to go round this  the wire fence ends at the rock and the cattle have to go round
No the fence is quite close to the road
We got a chance one night of the gate being open and we brought the cattle through it and that was the reason why he commenced to talk
By a foot messenger
Three days a week
Oh yes I know of it  and the man is carrying parcels
No
No
It would be very necessary to have improved communication during the fishing season to Loch Hourn
He is not obliged to carry above  lbs weight or so
Six or seven
I dont know but he told me last night he had about  lbs on his back or near about it
I heard that they would require to provide him with an assistant in such a case
Very much
Very little
Yes
There has been none as yet this season
Six families
Yes
Yes
They all wish for more arable land and more hill pasture than they haveroom for a reasonable stock of cattle
Most of them have not but one acre of land and one cow and the half of them have not an acre itself nor cow itself
Yes
No
No that is another Donald Macrae who pays that
Plenty
Yes the hill
The hill belongs to Eilanreoch
But I have seen the whole of Cosaig belong to the crofters who were in Kirkton and Cosaig
It is a long time since they lost the first part of it more than forty years ago
I do it was old Currie who was factor at that time
They took the first portion off that was right opposite the house of Eilanreoch and Currie said every person would be asking that portion
Then they shut up the fence there
What was down the other side of the fence they had for a good while afterwards
Then a man of the name oft Stewart came and the fence by this time began to break down so that the stock upon either side crossed
To make a short story of it the march was afterwards changed to the back of our house
Yes the people came to poverty and the proprietor was obliged to send them to America
Four hundred went away in one day
The land became desolate no person there
A few did not go away
The land was charged at  an acre and that rent was put on the few who remained
No
Yes rent was paid
It came down to s per acre the dearest of it
No not an inch
No
Yes
I heard that some had it for    but I am not certain
Yes we want both pasture land for stock and arable land to support our families
The land has remained unchanged but some have a good deal of it and others very little
I could do with what I have of arable land if I had the hill pasture and if I had seen the arable ground fairly distributed amongst those who had none at all
I judge that the poor people have about thirtytwo acres of arable land just now and there is only one horse among them to turn the whole of it
No  but round about between this and Cosaig
I am making one place of it
Cosaig is just an angle or corner of this place
No that would not suit because there are a good number of them who have only one acre
They would be better off than they are but it would not support them
There is an innkeeper in our neighbourhood who has forty or fifty acres but probably he requires more than an ordinary tenant because he has to support horses and that but still less than he has might suffice
About ten years
In Kirkton
That would be a long story to tell
They deprived me of my lot which I had here
I dont mean to blame the proprietor or the factor for it
There happened to be a lawyer of the name of Home manager of the property for Mr Baillie of Bristol
There were a lot of us gathered together and we were discussing the proprietors and managers and that and I happened to say there was no better stock of landed proprietors in the country side than the Baillies only they had very bad horns
Mr Home heard this in Edinburgh and resolved to put me out of the house and land
It was a very good lot which I had
In Gaelic
Mr Stavert was local factor at the time and Mr Stavert would execute any commission you would entrust him with
A printed paper was set before us that we were paying rent and containing a considerable number of articles which we were obliged to sign otherwise we Would have to go out of our lots
One of the articles was that if a son of mine married he would not be allowed to bring his wife into my house and if a daughter married she would not be allowed to bring her husband
I was not to be allowed to cut seaware or peat without the consent of the factor nor to keep a dog and lots of other rules of the same kind
I went away without signing the paper and the ground officer came next day and asked why I ran away without signing that paper the previous evening and he said that unless I signed it I would have to go out of my lot
Through fear I went and signed it
It was about that time that I was discussing proprietors and factors and it was then I made use of the expression regarding Mr Home
Two years after that
He gave no reason except that he would not suffer me to remain upon the estate
I never saw the man but I knew what was coming
Thirtytwo years whatever
Yes  I never slept one night in arrears
I never heard
I had a house and three cows
I was twenty years in the service of Mr Baillieold Bailliein charge of the people working at the district roads bringing in their time and getting money to pay the men
Only one
No horse
We are at the mercy of the gentle folks in spring if they will be good enough to give us a horse  and if not in the case of an old man like myself the land will have to lie waste
Yes
Yes I have
I have seen that great big glen from top to bottom full of people
Considerably over sixty years ago
I could not say
I could give you a number of the townships
The townships there were only small but they were bigger than they looked for behind them in the hills there were shielingsa shieling for every  townshipand these stood them well for they had a place for their stock
And if this Commission is to raise the people from the low condition into which they have come it will be by restoring the land to them
Yes
They depended upon their stock there was no fishing and a stranger throughout the whole district could get food and drink when he came
I dont know of such times  no doubt when the price of stock was low they would be straitened a bit  but when the prices rose again their stock would restore them into their former condition
No I never heard of it
America a great many of them  and some to Australia
It was made into bigger lands and given to the few who remained at home
We petitioned Mr Baillie  we complained that the land was too dear at   an acre and asked that he would give us it at   an acre and he granted our request and of all the lands that were fixed all that time there is none remaining now without change but one and that is the only lot upon which there is now a horse in the place  and there might quite as well have been a horse upon all the other lots
Yes  I am here one that was left
The glen is filled with sheep
It was done before that
The clearing began at the time of which I spoke and they were being gradually cleared down and down township after township until they reached the glebe
I can give you the names of nine of them and each of them with its shieling
It was then that the people could live well and there were heroes in the land
One man was stronger than three of these men here
They have neither the flesh nor bone nor sinews that they had then
The names of the townships were Maolmore Maoluachdarach Bolanalin Cnocfhuin Ardaun Abathalhith Achadahocuirn Airithcheachan Toamcluiadain Gallatar and Achdain
Yes with the exception of shepherds
They are included in Mr Mitchells farm now j they are included in Rattagan farm
No in Bruces time it was Mr Bruces factor who commenced the business
Yes
I have seen Bruce myself
England  and a good proprietor he was but he had bad servants
Undoubtedly
Those who could were obliged of their own accord to go away and those who were not able to go were only able to creep into such small corners as they might until their means failed and then they had to go away
No if the land had been left with the people there would have been no appearance of poverty
They had horses and cattle and sheep and they had the fishing of loch and river salmon
I am convinced of it
They have not food as they had they have not the fleece of the sheep and their children have no milk
They are fed like skeletons in comparison with those who went before them
I speak nothing but the truth but it is truth that should be told
It would depend upon the size of the township
They had their milk cows and followers and they kept a horse and young cattle upon the hill
In the last township whose neck was broken each tenant had ten milk cows and a horse
The number of sheep would be few  I cannot tell the number
I remember fourthe last of these people
They were first removed to a township across there opposite the shore a poor place
One of them is a next door neighbour of my own a poor crofter
There were two of them sent over to that poor place
The representative of the fourth family is the family now occupying the house upon Mr Macdonalds glebe
The first number that went away were those from the upper portion of the glen
They had their stock which they sold and they paid their own passage away
They thought it was a wise thing for them to go away
Six of my own brothers went
Some of them had no land
They were shepherds and they understood from the policy of the estate that it was wiser for them to go away and so away they went
The last two who went away were only poor crofters
I mean that they were deprived of it
They were in poor circumstances when they were deprived of their land
Two of them got a bit of a township and they are in here today where they have two or three head of cattle and a few sheep and a horse
The reason for their falling from prosperity to poverty is that they lost their land
They did not like being removed they were for remaining there living upon the produce of their stock and they became poor and latterly went away
That is the way
I cannot tell very well the number of years
The tacksman who came in let them all remain as cottars upon the farm
It commenced at the head of the glen nearly sixty years ago
In the time of the famine in  I saw  go away on the same day
You are the tenant of a farm in this vicinity
Since
Yes  Glenhuirich and Drimnaloram both in Argyleshire
Yes
I have
The Dumfriesshire farm is arable but the others are mainly pasture
Not quite
No I live for the most part in Dumfriesshire
Yes and my wife and family come and reside here for two or three months in the year
Principally shepherds a manager and other shepherds
Yes I heard that
It had been for a long time in the state in which I got it
No with the exception of ten acres that my predecessor Mr Mitchell got which belonged to some of the crofters
I dont know whether it was rented as one whole field or in different crofts but I know he had it separately from the rest of the farm
It is
They dont appear very anxious
I may state that the arrangement with the factor when I took the land was that it was to be enclosed for the crofters cows  and when I wished that part of my lease fulfilled I said they were bound to do so and the factor said they were not bound to continue the crofters cows but would rather do away with the cows than enclose the land so that the cows remain as they were and the prices fixed for the grazing also and all is just as it was before I got it
I was unwilling that peoples cows should be done away with
It is a great advantage to the crofters or to any person with a family to have milk and they just remained as they had been previously under the former tenant
There was no number specified it was to be enclosed if it were required a piece of the hill for the crofters cows
I could not give the exact words but that is the sense of them
On the valuation the people appointed could not agree
No
I understood it was just to be for the cows there were
I think they had rather more then than now
They were done away with at the wish of the people at least they did not put them on
No it was just the custom which had prevailed
No
Yes
I am not aware of any in this immediate district
At Strontian I have some but it is only for summer grazing and it is stipulated in the lease that the price is to be    s
No only for the summer months  and the   is for summer and winter
They can almost always graze out
They require some assistance but I believe Highland cows would live out almost without anything in an ordinary season
They are on the tether and there is plenty of heather
I have no doubt but that he stated the facts of the case
He has a very good Highland cow and he keeps it very well and I believe gives it artificial food both summer and winter
The stirk is included along with the cow in that calculation I should say included in the grazing indeed I should imagine he includes the feeding he gives to the stirk as well as that for the cow
Until it is twelve months old
Yes
Yes about that
None so far as I am concerned
Never
I dont remember ever refusing an application
It would depend on what part they took
Some parts of it might be spared  but the kind of arable land which would be of most advantage to the crofters would entail a change of the present sheep stock from Cheviots to blackfaced
We could not keep Cheviots on the hills without assistance of the arable land
It might be done  but i t would be a disadvantage to the farm
It is a matter of money so far as I am concerned a question of rent
Only one part of it is very near the dwelling house and a resident tenant would not like very well to have the fields in front of his house taken away from him
It adjoins the Cambusbain lands
Not of Arnisdale
The Cambusbain people would require to get it at Eilanrcoch as they had it before and I dont suppose it would entail anything more than the loss of the land there
It lies more advantageously for an operation of that sort
At Arnisdale you would require to take it off the arable land  and most farmers like a piece of arable land to grow potatoes for themselves
Ten years still to run
I have changed the outer part to blackfaced sheep
Only a few
They were all crosses between shorthorn and Ay rehire at one time but they are changed now there are more Ayrshires than there used to be
The rise in the price of stock wont compensate us and we are afraid that the rise in the price of stock will not continue the great scarcity of stock in England has had a great deal to do with it
I have no doubt of it
Not my immediate predecessor but the one before himMr Stavertpaid  and my rent is   s  and I think it would very likely go back to something like Mr Staverts rent
Yes
I am subject to correction in the date but I think it was
I have no doubt of it
Not so great as it would have been some years ago
Well if they would cultivate it well they would not be sufferers
It would require to be let in club farms
In a small way I should be afraid it would not pay
If one man had only fifty or a hundred sheep enclosed by themselves I am afraid it would not pay
I have no doubt small farms grazed with black cattle and blackfaced sheep as used to be would pay better than our large farms at present
Not on Arnisdale
There are a few but not many
There is not much arable land on Arnisdale
Not much over one hundred that could be worked at all
What is arable land in Arnisdale is very good land but all the remainder is bleak rocky land not adapted for cultivation
I break it all up in rotation except one portion which lies ina  Cheviot hirsel which if I were to break it up would necessitate a change from Cheviot to blackfaced stock and at present would entail a loss of  a head in changing from Cheviot to blackfaced
That is a subject on which I think a great deal of misapprehension exists
My father had the Strontian land in  and I think I am able to keep as many sheep on it as he did and a few more and I think they are of as good quality at least I get as much for them considering my neighbours sheep as my father did
I dont think there is any deterioration in the hill grazings
Any deterioration that may be is where game abounds rabbits and deer or what is more generally the case where people have stocked Highland hill land with sheep which were not suited for it and which should have been reared in parks
What are called highclass Cheviot sheep with open skins and arched noses are not able to live on the west coast or on almost any hill land but where you get them close in the coat and with good chests and able to protect themselves against the weather the land will keep as many of those sheep as ever it did excepting where it is overrun with game or is injured for some other reason easily accounted for
Most decidedly not
I hold a good many acres of land and all the land I have keeps as many sheep as ever I have heard of its keeping during this century as far as I can trace it back
No I dont think so
Yes
Yes very often
I would not like to answer the question
I have no doubt of it
There would not be so much in houses because most of the old farmhouses are remaining but I think the principal want would be the getting the class of tenants that formerly existed
I am afraid not
From  to  sheep and perhaps a score of cows
I would not consider it large
I dont think for a district farm  sheep would be very great
Yes
No altogether and their followers
Yes that is my meaning to restrict every one to a certain number
Perhaps four or five cows
Yes from  to
It would entail a certain expense at first
The sheep would find their own wintering
They would get the advantage in winter of the arable land which was cultivated
Fifty acres
If it were done on my farm it would
It would depend altogether on the class of land
I dont think so
Most of the land grazed by wethers would be under blackfaced ewe stock or mixed stock or blackfaced stock
Mostly wethers or at least a good proportion of it
fit for the purposes of a club farm
Part of it would
There might be a difficulty in that
It might be but you would take all the shore land and leave the high land for an outrunfor wether ground altogether
I could not say
I do not think there were above five or six
I think three
It would
I have no doubt I could  for this reason that it is the wintering part of it that the cows graze on
Cattle of any kind do cows less than young cattle but the mixture of cattle amongst the sheep improves the land
Oh no if they could be properly distributed over the land
I might not be a loser but I would rather not have them
I am speaking from my own point of view entirely
Yes
Perhaps 
Not many of them come home at s
I always count them at s but young sheep are not so bad as hoggs
I might mention that this district is very much in want of telegraphic communication
Excuse my taking up the time of the delegates but they did not seem to bring out that fact
Last year we had perhaps a couple of thousand fishermen here from all parts of Scotland and there was no telegraphic communication  and the postal communication is the worst you can conceive
It is not so bad this year but last year letters from Arnisdale lay two nights at Glenelg before they were sent away and they lay I believe another night at Strome
Now fish is a very perishable article and yet that was the communication the people had unless they went to Isle Ornsay
I think that is a great want in this district the want of proper postal and telegraphic communication
Yes
I have no doubt they have
Possibly it is not it depends very much upon what they wish to be at
If they are fishermen I think they should turn their attention as much as possible to fishing although of course they require land to grow potatoes and to keep cows for milk
As a rule the two dont go together to any extent
Yes
No
Yes and I think   an acre is a very high rent
Am I bound to answer that question
I dont think it right but I would rather not enter into my views upon that
No I dont
I have no doubt they would if they paid the same attention
That is my opinion
That is a different question
No
Yes I would
If we had such fishing at Arnisdale as we have had for the last two years I should say Arnisdale is the best place
The advantage would not be alone to the immediate neighbourhood but to all the fishermen on the west coast
If it had not been for the Loch Hourn fishing last year we would have had semistarvation over the whole district
Not except during the fishing
Isle Ornsay and it is very rough crossing over to it
I crossed it one day last year in extremity and I would not like to do it again under the circumstances
It would be a great advantage
Not that I am aware of
None
Yes
Yes
Yes or  of course more capital is required nowadays
Some of them would be of the present crofter class
A man must creep before he can walk and people with comparatively little capital must go from less to more
Yes
Yes
I have no doubt smaller places might be advantageously put in
No
No
Yes
Yes
I do

Yes

We are ruled in every respect in the same way as they have described but as regards cattle we have none at all

There were two a fortnight ago now there is only one

We got wood and it would have been better for us to have bought it such as it was it would have been as cheap for us
We got wood and it would have been better for us to have bought it such as it was it would have been as cheap for us
The wood came from Loch Duich
It was cut by the proprietors people there and the people who did the work were paid out of the money which was contributed for the assistance of the fishermen
When we went to get that wood there were some who required only one tree and they spent two days and a night in going for it
If they had got the money which was subscribed for the purpose from the committee who had charge of it it would have been cheaper for them to have bought the estate wood than to have gone for the wood to Loch Duich

With regard to the general management of the estate I can confirm what Mr Morison said
I believe that the proprietor means well to all but as regards the people of Bundaloch really the poverty is very great
I am living in the immediate neighbourhood of that place and I suppose I can see how they are getting on better than any other person in the parish and I dont know how they can manage to live at all
They are really worse
I believe the Letterfearn people are better fishermen than the Bundaloch people and they are nearer to the fishing ground
No about half a mile
There is a strong current passing Dornie and if the current is not going with them it is very hard to work against it
I may also say that as far as the proprietor is concerned with us Roman Catholics in the district we have always experienced from him perfect impartiality of treatment
He gives no favours
We have no more trouble than any one else and no one is afraid on account of his religion of being disturbed by the proprietor or the factor
I cannot say that I do

Nothing except the poverty of Bundaloch
I was sent as a delegate for them and if anything can be done for them it will be a great boon
They will never improve as they are because they cant
They do fish but they are not so successful fishermen as the Letterfearn men  and the fishing is a very precarious occupation
In many ways they would not earn what they would earn in the same time by days wages

Twenty but they were not all there
I have a statement which I wish to read
 Parish of Glenshiel Estate of Kintail
The following delegates have been appointed to lay before the Royal Commission the case of the cottars on what was the farm of Morvich and is now included in the deer forest of MrWinans viz Murdoch Macrae Alexander Maclennan and Duncan Macrae
They beg to submit the following statement and are prepared to answer any questions bearing thereon or on any matters relating to their position on which information may be desired
On this land there are nineteen houses in seven of which there is only one inmate in each
In the remaining twelve there are families of from two to eight persons
Among all these there are less than four acres of land available for growing potatoes or other crop
For the use of such portions as they had of this land such as were able gave work to the value of   per annum to the tenants and latterly to the proprietor
Five have cows for which  per annum each was paid for liberty to graze on the farm
All the lands of Morvich and Inchewe have been let to Mr AVinans who has endeavoured to compel the proprietor to turn all the cottars out of house and home
The history of the  Kintail Crofters  case is so well known that it need not be further referred to
The proprietor does not seem to have made any stipulation in his agreement with Mr A Winans for their being allowed to remain on the ground which he might easily have done
While the cottars can scarcely get a bit of land in which to grow a little food there are many acres of excellent arable land at Morvich which are admirably adapted for the use of crofters and which might have been given to them without any damage to the deer forest
Of this land no use whatever is being made at present
Some of it is covered with weeds and many acres about  are under a most luxuriant crop of clover and grasses which has been allowed to rot on the ground and is actually offensive to the senses of people who pass along the road
Since the farm has been turned into a desert no employment of any kind is given to the cottars
Not one of them is even employed to walk over the ground and turn deer every person employed being brought from a distance
The cottars are in great poverty and are most anxious to have a reasonable amount of landand some security against being turned out of the houses they have erected for themselves
No
Yes
They have
Yes
For twenty years
The farmer at that time sublet  worth of land to ten tenants which enabled them to keep one cow each but when he saw fit he took this land from them
One Alexander Macrae Torloisich
No the same man who gave the land took it away
I cannot tell that they had it before I remember
I cannot give any reason for that either only that he preferred to have it in his own hands
I should think not but our fathers were paying direct to the proprietor
The whole lot of it
There was not one
We have been making a very poor living
Others were going to the fishing and some going here and there for work and doing as best they could
No they were not
Yes it is
Our desire is to get more land
I am not aware that any change has come between us
We have expressed a wish to that effect to the proprietor Mr Mackenzie
I think nothing has come between us
No we have not made any proposal
No no intention of asking him
Yes shearing smearing and wintering hoggs in the low countiy
No
I dont know unless he wishes to send us all off and therefore does not wish to have any dealings with us
Not on this estatea gamekeeper here and there
Yes at a reasonable rent
Six acres arable each
Yes with the right to outrun for cattle
It would be of no use he does not allow his own gamekeepers to keep a cow  I dont believe he would give grazing for a hogg to any one
I believe about one hundred
We did but it seems we were too late the land was let before we made the application
Yes
Yes
Yes and he did not put us off but he might help us still
That was in it too
He did
We did not know but we might still get the land we desired he gave us some nets and a little money and a boat
Quite so
We did not know until we heard it was to be let as a forest
We did not know it at the time but we have ascertained since
It seems it was settled before we thought the lease was signed before we thought
I dont know as to that
I know that
I dont think he can expel us unless he gets the proprietors authority
I dont think it would harm either of them to the value of half a penny
Not one I have never seen one there
Down to the middle of the glen
It is rotting on the ground there
Only a piece at the end of Loch Duich
No
Of course we would require to have a fence
About half a mile
The arable ground
They would require a mile in extent
I believe about seventy years
Quite so
I cannot tell how many acres it is miles in extent
Yes there was deer
Yes
Very good indeed
As good as in any part of Kintail or the county
They were  they have ever been there
Yes I did
They had a good living
I suppose they would be if not it would be their own fault
They might without any harm
They would not I believe
I believe it would be very difficult for some of us
I believe some of them could
Yes it would not in the least spoil the deer forest
Exceedingly glad
Very few
A few hundreds are caught occasionally
Very little
Very few out of this country go
Yes
Ardelve
I was born in Kirkton and was only a year old when I was taken to Ardelve
Lots were made in Ardelve and my father got a share there
When lots were enlarged so many were deprived of those they had
One of them had land at one time and was deprived of it when the crofts were enlarged
The other one had no land himself but his motherinlaw had
One by working and the other by fishing
I am a road contractor myself and my brother
No
No we have not a good living
I have been accustomed to work hard for fortyeight years first on railways and since at every hard shovel and spade work
I was getting the best pay going
I married young and my family was increasing
The best one for assisting me died
There is plenty of land near us
The next farm of Kirkton
Nothing
I have nothing to say against the proprietor or factor on that account
No because I keep no beast
They are not heavy on me in that way
On the north side of the parish between Plockton and Strome Ferry
I was building a house and the proprietor helped me to do it
There was only one other man who improved his house and the proprietor gave him wood and the man slated it at his own expense
We were for forty years compelled to raise tangle from the bottom in about five fathoms depth of water with longpronged forks but of late we have got the seaware restored to us
That is what spoiled the land altogether
Yes but we sow it in grass in order to improve it
It is only for the last year owing to the storm having swept away all our crops that we had to buy so much
We would not have required to buy so much if it had not been for that
No abatement
We did not ask for any
It is the next place to Pait on Loch Monar side
Yes we got  each of a reduction and part of Altnaban given to us
It is himself who knows he has he has plenty of land on each side of us
We have a fence on each side of us forcing us into the sea and we have no chance to go on either hand
There is Fearnag on one side Auchmore on the other and Breantrah too
Oh
yes
They said they had no place for us
Yes but it was in order to bring us in to pay poor rates and taxes and schoolmasters and everything
It was better for us than we were before
There is only s of difference in the rent now and when we had the land that was taken from us for grazing
How can we keep out the sea when it chooses to come
It could be done by raising up an embankment before us but as the houses are bad it would be better to rebuild them and put them back from the sea
There is a great bank behind our house about  feet high which prevents us having our houses free from the sea
No
Fiftyfive years
I was born and brought up in Sallachy
There were people in it before I came to it
The first people that went to it went in the year before I was born
There were two when we came to it towards Kyle Inn that is at the end of Lochalsh but I do not know the time they came
Yes we must live somehow
We cannot be comfortable owing to the large number of us
There are seven families who pay no rent and are burdens upon us
Four families might be comfortable enough in the place and other four might be removed
Not one of them is related to us
They were forced in upon us taking the skin off the land
There they are and we cannot put them out and we do not believe the proprietor could
No everyone squats at his own freewill
I want to be as near the truth as I can because I am getting old
It was bad justice we got when we were sent to the place
It was only for the year we were sent there and they promised to bring us out of it afterwards and when we went to make the factor to keep his promise he said  It was a good thing I did not promise you much
Eighteen families paying rent
We have recently got an addition of land and we are paying between us about  We have not paid anything of the increase yet for the new land
Both kinds
We expect to be a good deal better if we get it stocked
We got from the proprietor everything we wanted we are not going to make any complaint we are satisfied as we are
Every man of them we got advice before we came here
Yes
There were tenants in Letter before we came to Sallachy but it was the proprietor who had it in stock when we got it  we were not the means of removing anybody
It is nearly sixty years now since I came to Sallachy
Yes
The place we had at first was pretty good but the new addition we got is rather bleak land
But we expect for all that that it will benefit us as we were too circumscribed in our former lots
Kyle Rhea in the parish of Kintail
It is my opinion they would be better today were it not for their folly money is more plentiful amongst the people than it was in my first recollection
There are no people in Kintail today  it is only deer
Oh 
yes they were far better  they had ground the mountains which were keeping people alive and now they are beside the shore
Oh I yes Kintail was better one man from Kintail was better than half a dozen that is true
Yes
I believe they do since they got the last teacher they attend better
They are coming on very well
He is an honest fellow the schoolmaster
There were no scholars at all at that time
They have too much pride today
Yes
Not so well I was fed on milk and the produce of sheep goats cows and cattle and fish
No
Potatoes and herring bread and tea they have no butter and no cheese
We have not got the stock yet but we expect to get it if we can get help to put the stock in
We are very glad that we have a wealthy proprietor who can help us when we require it
Oh 
yes six times more
One house will eat more meal than a town used to do
Meal is very good but not so nourishing as what I was accustomed to
I believe they were more friendly than they are today
Many of them are becoming rascals today
The people formerly were more cheery
They do not know how to amuse themselves so well as the old people
They were spending a good deal of their time in that amusement
No no
Yes
It is they that would
The old people spent a lot of their time in budding up dykes on the hills
Nothing but come home and lie down
Stories
Yes  and there is no word of that today
No house would be without its spinningwheel then
Very little
Every stitch that they put on
Very little
I believe they will come on they are coming on a little
They get wool cheaper now
Wool was very dear until now
When wool was dear they could buy their clothes cheaper than they could buy the wool
The people were all going to nonsense
Yes
Oh yes there was no shoemaker at all when I first mind
I do not remember of a shoemaker  everyone just worked for himself and his family
Plenty of that
Very little I believe
Too much vanity is not desirable moderation in everything is best
Sometimes when they took too much whisky
I cannot say but they were more friendly disposed towards each other there are more divisions now amongst them
They were more ignorant I believe
Oh well I saw that sometimes
Yes
Yes  when there was a fight then it was very severe the men were so strong
No no
Oh yes of course
Yes
There was a Roman Catholic church always too in KintaiL
No
No but they went among their cattle and wandered on the hills
They give more honour to the Sabbath now
Yes they pay more regard to the Sabbath especially
I was born in Kintail and my forefathers belonged from original times to KintaiL
I have
My fathers brother went to Sheriffmuir and never came home it was in Prince Charlies time
It is well known it is so
There are more of the Kintail people in Australia and America than in Kintail
They expected to improve their circumstances there
It is the money of the Indies that spoiled these parts firstit increased the rents
When a man comes from the Indies with plenty of money he does not care but to get plenty of land and he tries to take it from the poor by increasing the rent he outbids the poor man
My fathers brother
About eighty
About fifteen years
Not the half
Yes I knew several who had been at Waterloo
One especially I remember was quite contented and used always to be in our house being a relative of my father
I believe there was a verbal promise to that effect but no written promise
I heard long ago that they had a verbal promise but no written promise
My parents knew it
Always
Yes and more so
Yes
Yes
Yes
Thirteen paying rent between lots and halflots and there are four besides that who have a lot between them
Yes or people representing them
More than twenty miles
Yes
They kept a herd for them
About
Yes
They were made into a sheep farm
Part of it is on Lord Lovats estate  several properties meet there
It was on the west side the people had their grazngs
Part of them is in the deer forest
Yes
Yes
Yes
No
Yes some people who got it when it was taken from the crofters have it still
Yes
There were differents kinds of lots there were  s lots and  and there were others who had half lots and some had less than half lots
Each had his share of arable land laid out for him in different places so as to have good and bad together
No
I do not know of any who changed in this part of the country
No they had their arable land in different places so as to have good and bad together
It was agreed upon between the factor and the tenants that the rent of the place was to be  and that there should be   lots and afterwards one lot was taken away and the nine remaining were divided into ten
There were a few drains made and there was a dyke which had fallen down rebuilt a stone dyke
Yes near it at least on part of it between the houses and the arable land
Yes it was well built
Yes
About twenty years
I believe they are but it has not required mending
Yes
Very useful
No
We have a wire fence
It was not suitable
The ground was soft
No
It was
Principally I believe
Perhaps fifteen or sixteen years
It has not grown to that size yet
No
That is so
No it was the best it was along the river
Yes
I do not know that he said very much about it
He did not take anything off the rent for it
No
Yes
But this fence took the land away
No
No he did not
No
I am not certain
Yes
It kept our cattle and sheep from trespassing
Yes but if they had got good grass it would not have done them much harm
Yes it would be better for us and better for the sheep
There were not many cattle on the proprietors ground
No
Yes on the other side
No
Yes
It would be too expensive
Yes or to pay interest
We offered to put down the stones if the other townships put down their share
Not that I know of
Yea
Because they have less pasture ground than we have and they have a heavier stock than we
We do
No to the parties who have it on their shores
There is no tacksman near us who has seaweed
s to s a boatload
There are about twelve of our cartloads in a boatload
In some cases
Yes
Yes but not a serious accident
There is not any that we can claim except what we had ourselves because all those who have it nearer have use for it themselves
Yes
Yes
I cannot say
That other township has not got it now
It was given to Plockton by the proprietor
No it adjoins
Yes they border upon us
Yes they had a considerable amount of their own much more than we had
Yes
There is the farm of Balmacarra which lies partly along over borders and there is also Achnadarroch
Yes
Yes
Less than a third
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Some of us buy it from people in Plockton who do not use it themselves and some go to Kyle for it and different places
Yes
Two farmers
Yes and they occasionally sell some seaware
Yes we often spoke about it
It might be hard enough for us but still these tenants do it and it would hardly do to take it from them
Yes
Yes and if we had more we would not require to buy it or go such a long distance for it
Yes
Not very large
It is falling back
I cannot say there are not so many people going away want of marriages perhaps
They do not get any valuation for their improvements so far as I know
Not unless it was taken off a large farm
I do not know of any
I believe quite as much
It would be much more satisfactory to them and I believe there would be less pauperism
Oh no I am a sheriffofficer
I am default officer to the School Board
Yes
Yes
Yes very strong
Not so much
Before this agitation commenced they had the same views and opinions as far as I know
There were more people in it at one time
There are people owning ships there still
Yes two  but they dont go to Plockton
They are large vessels which are owned by Plockton people
Not that I know of  I believe there are almost as many now as there have been for years
There are almost as many schooners now as any time I have known
Yes
I dont think there was
I cannot say of my own knowledge
I have heard them say the rule under Mr Lillingstone was pretty favourable very favourable to the poor people
I think he did  there were some turned off from Avernish but I am not certain
I cannot say for my own knowledge I do not remember that they did and I do not remember hearing people say it
Yes
Yes
A good deal of land that the Plockton people had was taken awaythe greater part of it I believe
Yes
No reason that I know of
Quite as easy
I dont know that it does because there is always plenty of water but it has taken the green places on the borders of the river awayon the other side of the river
Yes
Yes
Yes
There was an old fence along the river before this wire fence was made which was kept up when the people were living at Achnadarroch in equal portions by them and us
I believe it could have been as short on the other side
Yes
Yes it was the best grass
Yes
Principally upon the Achnadarroch side with the exception of a short piece about  yards on our side
Yes
Yes
Are you much employed as a sheriffofficer
No
For debt and these things
It is very seldom that I have any of removal
This year
It was in the village of Plockton
A man who had a house there was turning another man out
Yes
Not the slightest
Not very much
Yes
Between fifty and sixty miles
No
There was a Court held in Loch Carron last year but it is very seldom that there is a Court nearer than Dingwall
I am not sure
I was not there
I do not know that it is
No I have not very much to do but still the children do not attend very well
Five
Yes
Once a month generally
Yes
No nothing except advising them
No
No generally not
The proprietor and two or three ministers a merchant in Plockton and the bank agent
In the estate office at Balmacarra
Yes
The two pieces were about twenty acres
I cannot say
No it is not it was not the best of the pasture land
Yes partly and partly not but still not the best of the pasture land
Yes
Yes I believe it would in some places
In no place quite close to the bank
Yes
We have not replaced them
We keep for each lot two oneyearolds in summer two stirks but still it would be better for us to send them away to another place and pay for them
Yes
It would hold twenty stirks
Yes
There are ten lots nine lots were made into ten
It is to have them in good condition and they are not in good condition
No
It is overstocked by other townships encroaching upon it
Yes
Not much more than the half of what we pay
 or perhaps 
Not the pasture land they do not require arable land so much as pasture land
They could do with more but more pasture land would suit them better
I think eight acres of arable land six cows and fifty sheep
It would be worth 
I do not know the rent of any of the farms
No it is not fenced there is no fence round the common pasture
Yea
Yes
It would be too expensive
Yes
Yes
I do not know they simply nominated me for it
Yes
They have been mostly all contested
No
Yes
They were not all at home but all who were at home were present
A fortnight on Tuesday
Alongside of Loch Long
Five miles at least
A steep place difficult to work
More than fifty years
By other tenants
No
Yes
There were thirteen lots
Yes
More than thirty years I cannot say exactly
It has not
Yes two years ago
We have to buy food for them in winter and to send them to Conchra in the summer
Beside us
Dr Duncan
As long as we can get them about a month  we are not allowed to keep them longer there
From neighbours round about the country
Some are fishermen and others day labourers
Pretty regularly  but when there is no fishing to be had they dig and do other work
Yes
Very few almost none nowadays
Ouly small boats for the local fishing
Herring fishing always
Very little as yet
No horses
No but there is no place for us to keep them or to work them
No it is that steep that it would be impossible
Yes
No other way
It is getting less and less common
If we could get a better place that is what we want
Not far from us
There are some hill farms on the Conchra side
Kinnamoine and the deer forest beyond that
As a deer forest
We would not be able to take it all but a small quantity we would
It is stated to be nineteen acres
Yes
About ten acres
I should say eight each
Yes it is worse still
Yes or more
Four cows and a horse
Fifty or about that
We have not considered that probably they would not take the rent we would offer
Yes the ground we occupy is hardly worth any rent
No
Yes
It would be too dear at half what it is
We are the first
Because it marches with us and we are needful
Those at Sallachy had
We send them outside our own pasture in summer but we keep them inside in winter
But we have to buy food in winter for them
They are all the year round on our own land except one month
We would require more time for them to be off the land but that wont be granted us
Is d a week
A pound or thirty shillings
Some of them have it depends on how they work their land
Some keep more land in grass and others cultivate more produce
Not I as I have two lots and leave out more of the ground in grass but those who have only one lot have to do so and have to buy
There is a man here from the township who can tell that
Sometimes we rear a young beast in order to replace an old cow and in that case the expense is incurred
Some years we do and others not
From different parties just as we can get it
Straw and hay
Yes
A cow a stirk and a few sheep because the place is too rocky for cattle
Yes
No I am not able to do that
I believe not
Quite so
I smeared at Martinmas twelve sheep and two hoggs but there are not so many alive today
No some of us have none at all
We agree satisfactorily in regard to that amongst ourselves
No because an understanding was arrived at amongst ourselves and those who dont have them cannot claim anything from those that have
No
We keep them up to the rock at the back
There are not so many sheep as to make any difference
There is no doubt but it is
If we got it from the proprietor himself we would be quite satisfied to get it reasonable
Quite so
Very much better than where we are
Some of it
Undoubtedly
I dont think so considering the nature of the place and the circumstances we are situated in
Since I was able to do the work
Yes
Five
Yes
No
Some do get employment and others do not
There is plenty of work for lowlanders but not for natives
We are fishing
Yes a little
I want to explain that one of them is a mason
Yes I am working in the country with Mr MKay who is a native man otherwise likely I would not have got employment
In the time of Sir Hugh Innes
I believe my grandfather was about the first to go there
There is not an old man in the township today they have all died out
My own grandfather came from Balmacara John MRae came from Camusluine another came from Durinish and Matheson came from Lochcarron
I cannot say
I think it was at the time of Sir Alexander Matheson buying the estate but I am not sure
Death carried off the bulk of them
I think they are a little better but they are miserable enough
But of course the ten were more miserable
s per acre
It was between us and the public high road so as to keep us from straggling beasts
John MRae and my mother
I believe they were in respect that they were offered wood and lime free and then that the premises would belong to the proprietor after them
Yes we are unless we obey all the behests of the factor otherwise the law is let us take the road
I cannot mention any case but our fathers were so slavish in spirit that they had no idea of going against anything that the factor could order and therefore were quite facile in the factors hands and we want to be emancipated
My father effected  worth of improvements
The improvements were measured but when he went for payment which had been promised he was threatened by the factor that he would be put out of the land if he dared to ask it
No
About twentyfive years
We are quite willing to pay interest for a certain number of years but we object to have it laid on as rent continuously all our lives
A shilling in the pound for twenty years I consider fair
We would be quite willing to pay it for a few years more in order not to defraud anybody of his just right but we dont believe it should be kept up during all our lifetime
We have now been paying it twentyseven years and we believe the debt should now be extinguished
I dont know
Yes
I never drew money out of the bank for a years time  only for a few months at a time
I think so
Yes
Mr Livingstones time but I cannot say how many years ago
I have been in this neighbourhood for the last ten years and never a stob was put up until the last few days when we believe it was done owing to this Royal Commission coming round
Yes every year and complained of our loss at the same time
They were away before I was born
I have
Yes I have that the most of them were lost and that those who arrived over safe were badly used ever afterwards were in a bad state
Besides the dyke already referred to the proprietor did a few drains but beyond that nothing
The people themselves have drained almost every year and turned out stones
Yes
No it was not a suitable place for people to be in
As long as we had local or native factors we got the preference  but since that has been changed and since the factors have been lowcountry men they have introduced natives of their own districts into all positions such as grieves and the natives have no chance of anything of that sort
We get nothing above a day labourers appointment or employment and unless we are very plausible to these lowcountry officials we will not get even that
I dont think they have
As far as the forests are concerned I cannot say anything
In regard to the woods the natives get employment as day labourers but in the forest and all over it is lowcountrymen
I think they cannot have any goodwill towards us because my father was never in debt
He died nine years ago and since then the rent has been regularly paid and last spring I went for timber to Mr Watson the local factor but did not get from him any satisfactory answer
We never come in contact with the proprietor and we dont know what his intentions towards us are  but it is quite apparent that those who are in favour have been prospering for years
We dont know whether it is directly through him or his agents  we cannot say
Very few
My grandfather and father were paying rents here at all events I dont know before them
Yes
Yes undoubtedly
Five tenants in that small village
No there are other three besides that and the mill croft
Nine
One cow a follower and a calf some years and some years not
One cow and one calf
It is only two or three months
No
Some of them keep more in the winter and put them to grass with the sheep farmer in summer time
Yes some of them
Send them to grass to the big farms wherever they can get grazing
Some of those who keep the extra stock have to buy winter keep for them in addition to their own produce
Some buy cattle and others rear them and then they buy from neighbouring tenants in order to feed them in winter
Nobody need understand that although there is land for them to stand on it will feed them in winter without buying
No it is not the fact that we have more arable land than will support our proportion of cattle for the summer grazing
We have byre room for them and outrun room for them to stand on but not to feed them but we are entitled to buy food for them
I say that the rents are too high in comparison with the big sheep farms or tacks but per se I dont consider they are too high
Yes
Yes
Yes
The summing of the place is one cow and calf and the extra cattle have no right to be there only we agree among ourselves to tolerate each other for having an extra one
I am not aware that it is any loss
Knockgorm

They have land in Kilellan but not so much as they used to have part of it was made into deer forest
I believe they have
Yes if they were so inclined
Yes if we got it at a reasonable rent
By comparison with the big sheep farms about
Yes according to the rental paid by the big sheep farms in the parish
No it cannot hurt him
No
Yes  but I would hardly know him although I met him on the road
I think it was William MLennan
He went abroad I think
No
Mr Brown of Kilellan
It was for some years in the hands of the proprietor himself and I believe it is since Sir Alexander came that Mr Brown got it
They went to the factor Mr Watson who promised to represent their wish to the proprietor but whether he did so or not we have not heard since
Yes
The whole
Yes
Yes they did get a good deal of employment then  but there were local factors in this district who would give them employment
But since then matters are chanced and now no one can get employment of any importance except strangers
Yes
Yes thinning the wood
It is up round some parts of the wood and in other places it is broken down
There was one part taken from us formerly and we have got authority this year to pasture cattle inside that part of the wood
No
I cannot say  we only got it at the last term
Nothing extra
The east coast fishing at Peterhead
Yes but I did not go
Nothing
I am quite healthy
That is a question I am not bound to answer to anybody
That I work it every year
My other brother was working along with me on the croft
Three acres as far as I am concerned
Something about the same or maybe four acres
They have more pasture
No the pasture is separate
Yes
They are much about the same
Yes
Yes sell it when it is a year old
Some years they keep them on the sheep farm
No
They are divided into two sections and each has not a separate pasture at all  the pasture is in common in two divisions
No it would not carry them
Yes
They would keep as much again as we have summer grazing for
No some of them had to buy that is according to the labour they do in the spring time in the way of putting on manure seaweed c
I could not say
Well the place is so small that nobody hardly can wait to lose that much time in the spring as to put the place in order
Cattle altogether as far as I am concerned
It is all arable land the most of it is arable land
 sheep I believe
Part of it
Yes
Not so far as I am instructed by the rest
No by no means
We would try and do it
What would become of the four cottars who had none
I dont know whether you would call them highly rented or not they are very small
I am thinking it is
I dont know I never asked him
Take the crofts acre for acre with Auchtertyre or other places
Yes
Yes
Yes
No we are not bound to go there but the mill is useless
Since the big farmers in the country gave up sending the corn to be ground the mill has been neglected because there is only bere sent to it and it is almost useless
I had corn there and it was seven weeks before I could get it ground this year
Want of water and bad machinery both
Easily
Sixty families
I could not say
I am certain there would be and more
No nor half so valuable
Every year since the sheep were put on it is getting worse
It is very probable
I cannot say anything as to that because we dont know what is to come but we know what is
I believe if it is cultivated it will be improved again
Yes undoubtedly
That is quite easily understood that it would
Eighteen years
Yes
From the townships of Avernish Kinnamoine that is the end of the peat moss and Altnastu
Eighteen
Argyleshire
Yes for the various townships
Yes
DUNCAN SINCLAIR JOHN MATHESON DONALD MACKENZIE delegates
Yes
It is the substance of course I may have varied from their expressions in the Gaelic
Nothing and I insisted that they should appoint a delegate to come up to tell you that the statements in these papers are not my views alone
Is it in regard to going to the bottom of the sea
That is the expression of the people
They know they have been regarded as a nuisance and have been wanted to be sent abroad and they know very well they were sent into these rocky promontories and boggy holes
That is the experience of the people although it is not so bad as in some parishes
Well  wild animals perhaps would be the proper term  that passage refers to the deer forest
They say our Parliament and Legislature have been legislating for animals with the greatest care by means of the Game Laws but have never passed any legislation for the people
It is to these matters that that passage refers
Well I modify it to the extent of saying  wild animals
The raspberry burn
I am not aware that there have
When the grazing was taken from them thirtyone years ago so far as I know
I dont know that they should be called evictions j the people were a sort of induced to go by the proprietor or his factor who wanted to form the grazings into a sheep farm for his own son
No none
It is a well known fact that it is so by constant cropping
I am not sure whether they have any out in grass but the only crops are potatoes and oats and they are put down time about
One of the people themselves would be better able to speak to that
Yes it is quite near
Not in all
Yes
Some have been adding to them and some roofing them with felt instead of rushes
Different doors so far as I know
They have mostly chimneys but I dont know whether they all have
I know the proprietor gave one family last year money to improve their house and it is a very good house now
I have been given to understand that the proprietor is willing to give them wood and lime to improve their houses generally  I think that is understood throughout the estate
But as these houses were mostly built by the crofters themselves they have a disinclination to accept wood because then they could not claim compensation and they think when the houses have been altogether built by themselves they can claim compensation
Yes
Mr Livingstone
A John MLennan
John MLennan died this spring at the age of  quite a poor man after having been a great man
In  or  I am not sure which
I am not aware I was not in the parish and I have not asked as to that
Yes there has been a case of that in Loehalsh since last Whitsunday on the extensive sheep farm of Knockgorm part of which was given to tenants in Attadale in Lochcarron and part to tenants in Sallachy
I dont think it ever belonged to the Sallachy tenants but the hill grazings of Knockgorm belonged to all the townships in Lochalsh they used to send their cattle and horses there in summer and the lower pasture was allowed to go
Yes  quite
They have a rocky fringe round about and the pasture extends across the hill and the sheep slope is planted
It carries a stock of  sheep
The whole of that
No it is not extensive at all
Some would not but others would
But they would do it unitedly they say
Those who are not able would be helped by those who are and they would give a share to those who have not any thrifty neighbours who have a little money
I think so
Their lots are considered to be much dearer than the sheep farms
Yes I believe there is a lease
The tenant showed a disposition to give it up if arrangements could be made
He says he would not be a barrier to the people getting it as he has other large sheep farms
No in Kilellan in a neighbouring parish
He keeps a shepherd here
Yes and it must be rather a heavy burden I should think
Yes
I have not done the actual writing of some of them but I composed them
Yes otherwise I would not have appeared in case it should be said I was representing my own  views
Quite certainly
Not very
The average attendance for the last year was  I had the inspection yesterday
Decreasing and so is the population
About that
It is not so numerous but most of the young people are going away and very few of the people are marrying and the population is decreasing considerably
So that in proportion to the population they attend as well as they formerly used to do
Yes
Sixtyone
Thirtynine but a good many more left at the end of spring who would have been qualified if the inspection had taken place then
There were fortyfive qualified but some of these were absent at the inspection and only thirtynine were presented
Ninetyeight were enrolled during the year
Yes
I have certainly
It is the most unfavourably situated school in the parish
It was very suitable under the old parochial system when the children did not come forward until they were pretty old but now when they have to come in from Balmacara and Ardelve three miles they cannot come so regularly
So many come from Raivaig and Balmacara and Avernish and Kinnamoine
Very often at the time when the crops are being laid down or the peats are being stacked or when they are making hay and cutting corn
There were only three in the sixth standard about six or eight in the fifth and two in the fourth
But almost all those who left in spring were the bigger ones and those who came in were younger
Yes
Because they think that when they require to send them in at the age of five they ought to be free to take them away when they come to thirteen
They come earlier and go away earlier but I believe it would be far better otherwise
It would be better I believe if the age was raised from five to six and that the children should remain at school till they were fourteen it would be better for the Highlands
Not many from my school but a few occasionally
Most of them have taken to the sea and I have some in good positions abroad
They take to that more readily than to college
I have just now one who is a missionary at Kyleakin but as a rule they prefer mercantile pursuits nowadays
No
To see what you were doing
Well the deer come and eat our crops
It is a hard thing for a man of my age to watch out every second night to preserve my crops and after all that the crops should be eaten up
I have only two sons and they are at the east coast fishing to provide food for us
Eight
Yes in the same way
Four every night
We never asked him to pay
We never asked the proprietor anything
Of course quite certainly how can it be otherwise
Although I could take my watch one night it would be very difficult for my wife who might perhaps be nursing to watch the next night
One might keep watch but the other might not and so the crops are lost
Yes we spoke to him about a fence and he said if we would put the stone ourselves he would put the iron
Three feet high all the stone wall
Over a mile
In some places there are plenty stones along the course of the dyke in others not
Perhaps it would I believe we would be better off than we are if we did I am certain of it
But we thought that the proprietor might perhaps help in building the stone wall if we gathered the stones
I can only speak for myself I would have been glad of that for many a long day but the others are away at the east coast fishing and I cannot speak for them on that subject
Perhaps so
Yes
Everything we could we would give assistance in every shape
There are eight lots and three families that live upon the township in addition
Every one of them except myself and my neighbour here
There is just one other man and he is too old to come here he is lame
No they would not support us although there were no deer  we never look to that
They would help us they would assist us and they often assist us although the deer are injuring us but if fences were set up they would assist us very much
No we have plenty of hill pasture
That is all our complaint
Yes in our place anyway
Yes and that township the crofters themselves fenced
About a mile or a little more
There is another township Fearnmore where the deer never came
I cannot tell I know nothing about it
I know the proprietor does not stop there others do I dont know whether it is a tenant or not
We did not know that we could do that but evidently we know it now
I came to see what was going on
I dont know that we have anything to say which our own proprietor would not do for us
I think he himself will do all that we want
No
There was a point made by the inhabitants that the shingle is taken away from the southeast end of this village by the road commissioners and ships in search of ballast
By the removal of this shingle they consider these stances are endangered
Several high tides have occurred in the last few years and one or two years ago they washed away the road in front of the village here and they fear for the stances upon which their houses are built
They have complained and there have been some local squabbles between them and the commissioners
I am not aware what steps have been taken in connection with the matter
That is a question I cannot tell
It is claimed for the proprietor and there is a statement put forward which you heard from the first witness and which I do not understand about its belonging to Government
That has been prevented I am informed by the ground officer
Yes
I am prepared to do so
Not at present
Sixteen miles from the public road of Applecross and twelve miles from the public road of Shieldaig
Both roads to open the country
From Shieldaig we had a postman running to Fearnabeg twelve miles
Yes to six or seven townships
We petitioned his Lordship for the road and he refusedhe did not refuse it but at the time we petitioned him he sent a note to the ground officer to go and measure the length between Inverbain and Applecross and before that came into operation his Lordship died and it was never done
It would be useful to the whole place
They promised that at the time of the petition They said they would put in a weeks work to help the roads
Yes
There would be different families according to the number of the people
It is a road the proprietor takes there for the deer and gamekeepers  it is not for the use of tenants
No only a small road four or five feet broad
I hope so because they said it at first
Many difficulties
The country is blocked here for want of a road  the children cannot get to school
The ground is pretty rough and there are rivers and burns where bridges would be required
Yes according to the number of rivers and burns
Yes but without a road they cannot do right
Yes we were paying road money since the olden times but when they put more rent on the crofters they put the road money in connexion with the money they put on the land
Yea
There are six families
Not in the neighbourhood but there is one on the coast
About six miles
Yes we cannot do but by boats
No
No he is confined now himself and is not coming to the estate
We have not seen him for three years
I suppose so
Yes
No there is not much complaint of the crofts the rent is reasonable
Yes lots of crofters
Not them all some are not
There are other two from the estate here with grievances I dont know what about
John MLennan Cuaig and Donald Macrae
About three miles from Fearnabeg
Yes
Seven or eight crofters I suppose
Yes
There are twelve villages along the coast altogether
It would
About four hundred between young and old
Yes I understand so
I never came to consider this until just now and we would rather put that in the hands of the Commissioners
Not at this time
Yes
Yes
That is our paper but it was not given to me
 In the multitude of people is the kings honour but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince
Prov xiv 
Again woe is pronounced against those who join house to house and field to field till they dwell alone in the midst of the land and no place left for the poor to dwell in Isaiah v

I cannot tell I was not paying much attention at that time my father was alive
The MBarnets increased that rent of   to   each and increased the number of families from eight to sixteen
Yes
There was some peat ground reclaimed with borrowed money by the factor upon the estate at the timeColonel Macpherson and for this ground we paid s each but I cannot give dates
Yes

About nine years
About nine years
I was not in arrears myself but probably some of my neighbours were

He was manager for a sheep farmer upon the other side of the river before MBarnet got the property

He was manager for a sheep farmer upon the other side of the river before MBarnet got the property
Not exactly before he got the property but before he got possession
Not exactly before he got the property but before he got possession
Yes
Yes
Certainly
There is one thing in the paper that I do not agree with  that is asking Mr Darroch for   sheep
He is an excellent proprietor not to be beat in his dealings with the poor men anywhere
But the land is dear a croft only having one cow and one calf
Then the tide burst in upon us and the lower portion of our town is under level of highwater mark so that the sea covers a greater portion of the inside and middle of our township now and because of this encroachment of salt water supposing the crops were coming to the ear they wont ripen

Five
Camusfail
Yes
Kinloch upon the other side is one that is fenced the gamekeeper lives there
No except Shieldaig here
Yes
They have a few
Only one family
I cannot tell
 s each
No
I cannot tell
Yes
I cannot tell he is here himself
I cannot tell I never heard of its being measured
It is not so very large
No
It was hill pasture for crofters
They had it the same way as they had the low ground
There was one man that had a great deal of stock upon that hill then there were two other townships in addition to ours which had right to send stock upon it
The Glen of Shieldaig
The sheep had the run of the hill
Yes there was  taken off the land at the time we were deprived of the pasture but shortly afterwards that   was added to the regular rent
I cannot tell but I know the rents were raised all round at that time
The nearest town to us got it anyhow I cannot tell for the others
About twentyone years
There was no forest but there were deer
Yes it is pretty wide but it does not by any means make the great portion of the surface of the estate
Mackenzie of Applecross
Yes
No not at first
There was no forest strictly  called but there was a place among the higher grounds where the proprietor used to shoot but no stock was kept there
Yes I know it but I am not acquainted with it
I hear that some of it is under deer at least
No
It is far away from our place but I hear it is
I dont know about other places in that state
Yes I have gone that way
I understand it is now
Yes they were part of the Applecross estate
I may know him but I am not aware that I do
Right opposite from where ws are
It is just right opposite the steamer it is not a mile by sea it is three miles by land
We never asked himself personally but we asked his servants
He himself has only lately come into the place and we have not had much opportunity to speak to him
We have not had the opportunity it is only twice we have seen him since he got the place
Yes
Yes
No and we do not know what he may do about the fence itself we have nothing to object to as far as he is concerned
Oh yes more than once I did once and there was another  man made a complaint on another occasion
It was the other man that was the spokesman I was not at home at the time but he says they refused to put up the fence
There would have been about thirty at that time there are not so many people in this place there were twenty and four and five
No the march of the other townships is fenced
Yes we sit up every night to watch them
In harvest
When the potatoes appear above the ground they begin to eat them and continue eating them until the shaws get very big then they stop
Then they begin again when the corn is ripe and when the potatoes are ripe they eat the potatoes and continue right on until the crops are closed up
Nothing
Not since I was born
Yes we would be very glad to assist him in every way
The tenants had right to graze over the whole of the land which is now forest and now a great portion of the low ground because of the deer is quite useless to us
I am not aware that it was ever let it was Sir John Stewarts own sons that used to shoot over it
I am not able to judge I have no idea I am not a very good judge of the value of land
We ourselves had one hundred and twenty sheep upon it the six of us
Tho rent was reduced the same as ours but it was afterwards increased the same as ours
The whole of the estate was increased as far as I am aware at that time
Yes
Nothing
I cannot tell
A year last Whitsunday
Five
 s each
My own township
Yes
A mile would cover it scarcely a mile
I cannot say
Well yes we thought that perhaps you had the power that we were to get justice like other people
No not very difficult
I do not say that he would refuse to put up any reasonable fence
My own township
I cannot tell
In the glen upon the other side of us they had more sheep each than we had
I can not
As things go today s a sheep perhaps
I cannot undertake to say
Yes where there are very large places perhaps
We were not looking at it that way we had the right to the hill as part of our crofts
Some perhaps not all
Two at least
Two at least and perhaps four
Yes perhaps some of them could buy more or less but probably the whole five could not buy the whole number
That is all we have no further complaint
No it is very bad
The crops look better than the land this year the crops look very well but the land is very bad
Yes I think it is
Between s and   
Yes
Yes we would be very glad to do that
Yes we would be quite pleased with what he said but no man of conscience would value it at that
There is very little available arable ground almost all the possible arable ground is cultivated
The proprietor was doing very well towards us he was doing what he could
He cannot give us what he has not but we consider the land dear
We would like very much if we would get additional grazing
Yes there is what would be of great service to us
There is a hill upon which we have cattle but it is not settled upon us but for the year and we would like to have it permanent so that we could stock it
My father and my grandfather and my greatgrandfather had that hill
No we are not afraid but we dont know anything about it
We know we are in want of it
We do not get it for that purpose and perhaps there were some among us who could not provide the other stock even if we got permission but if we did get permission we would endeavour to stock it as we were able
Yes if we could
Yes we got this year that hill that I have spoken of
We were not told that we would have to pay rent perhaps we may have to pay a little additional rent we do not know
But if we had an additional cow to our summing we had to work ten days labour for it
We buy here and there if we do not have it ourselves
s to s
Ten days work  that would be easier than to pay  s a year
I think we would afford to work he is not hard upon us in that respect
The last bit of work we did was for our own good making a road for ourselves
Yes
Yes from the public road
Five miles
No it is only a path
We keep it up at the proprietors expense
Yes it would be a very great convenience but we have neither cart nor horse
What could we do with a horse and cart what would be the use of a cart without a horse 
Thirtythree years
Yes
Latterly the proprietor lived for the most but formerly he only lived occasionally
No anything we have got in that way has been from the present proprietor
Yes it was raised during MBarnets time
The rent was raised during his time and the tenants were increased
The place had only sixteen families at first and they were increased to twenty
I could not understand him supposing I did hear him
Yes they were sent across to our west side from the south side
There are about sixteen or seventeen families yet
Inveraligin
Yes some went away voluntarily to America and Australia
They got money from the old laird of Torridon
Mackenzie
What else but that they could not remain after the land was taken from them
Yes every benefit we ever got has been got since he came
MBarnet was not hard with respect to the rents but he was not laying out money upon improvements
Yes I am not aware there was any cause of his being unpopular
He put sheep upon the place and kept it in his own hands and that was the beginning of depriving us of our hill pasture and stock
No unless he will give us additional hill pasture
Yes but we would not like to have a rent that we cannot pay
No we had no sheep when he came and he got sheep for us and they had to be sent away
We were not understanding one another amongst ourselves about those sheep
Yes
It was myself that purchased them and the stock was deteriorated and we were getting afraid that the money that was invested in them could not be realized and so we sold them
Yes for those who lost their houses by the former proprietors in this village
There is no one in the village of the old race that would make a public meeting but widows and  poor people and that sort
It is not the present sort in the village that are the old residents
Yes and there are some of them here
Four or five
I think six or seven
No I have no business on the land but for fishing and trading by sea
Well that is the most of it all
The next proprietor that came was Sir John Stewart and he took the houses from the widows and those people and made his own property of them
Thomas Mackenzie Applecross
Yes the place was given to five or six farmers before the village was built
No those were not small
There were no sheep at that time  the forester would not allow them
When the village was measured every lot was measured with it and every man took his own lot at that time
Yes twenty shares in the village
About an acre
Arable land
Plenty
Two cows  that is the standard of the Government they must not exceed two cows each
No they are fined if they keep sheep in this village
No horse they must keep to their trade
Twenty  they cannot be altered
No
There is no more than seven in the village just now I think
There is no one in the district that has a cow from the proprietor but strangers
The same number is in the village but two or three are given to one
Two cows for every lot if they like to keep them
 s for every lot
Mr Murray at present
It is a fixed rent by Government it must be about  On the improvement Sir John made he added    to the rent and I think it is worth it  he put a fence round it and drained it and the like of that
No
No
No but may be there are other people in the village who complain for land but my complaint is about the fishing
No the fish are not lost but the regulations have been taken off the village
I have a vessel myself and I was not given power to repair her and she must fall over on her side
Generally they come some years  and some years not
But there is plenty of fish in general
They had big fishing vessels and boats fishing then  and they were curing fish and sending them to the principal markets of the kingdom
It was themselves who did it
No themselves were bound  those who advanced the money for the trade they built the vessels by order of the Government and took those vessels to the people for working them
They were bound to do that
No since the laws and rules were taken off the whole village is done
There is not so much as a fishing boat since twenty three years back except one
No only boats fit for carrying ware and peats
No  there is no such thing here  it is the village itself that is working by fishing
He could not do anything unless the rules and laws of the village would be given back again and the village given to the people
Yes but it is the byelaws of the village we want
That the lease must be renewable for ever and when the lease comes to an end in the village the trade is done
Yes
There is a difference in a parliamentary village between the means of the village and sites and stances
The proprietor may make a change if he likes in the means that is when a man falls to poverty and cannot pay his share of the means he will give it to another but the house and garden are fixed to him for ever
It is the members in the village that are bound to set up the villagebound to work it up
If we  could get the village we could build boats and vessels ourselves and set out to the fishing
That is what we want will he keep all the rules of His Majesty or not
If the present proprietor keeps the village to himself it is of no use then to the population under that rule
Plentythe late proprietor Sir John Stewart
Sixteen or seventeen years ago and less than that
Not yet
This is what I will say about the proprietors unless the Government keeps the proprietors back we are gone
Yes
No it is in the hands of the proprietor it is for that I am speaking and for other houses in the village
By the gamekeeper getting hold of the rule of the place
Oh no it is a lease renewable for ever
Ten shillings of feu
Yes but he would not take it at last
They wont take the feus in this place
The leaseholders in this village because it is a parliamentary village a great number had no written leases
There were no writings of that sort going about here but just a parliamentary title the same as the schoolhouse under the Act
And there was no wall taken then less than  feet side walls
No and no other in the village who lost houses
The houses are in the hands of the proprietor in the most of the village
Mr Fraser
I dont remember
Oh
no
Donald Mackenzie master of the Enterprise
Yes
Yes from s to s and s is the highest s and s they commonly are
I cannot tell that unless he is able by Act of Parliament to increase it at the end of ninetynine years
No wonder
Yes because His Majestys byelaws have been taken away and the gamekeepers laws put into the place
We have the Act of Parliament for the villages but we have not the byelaws
The byelaws are signed amongst the people
No it is an old thing and the village was broken down in that bad manner and a great number of the writings were taken away and spoiled and everything in the village
There were writings two hundred years old
Yes
The same amount except s for fencing the place
Yes twenty shares
Yes there are but there are three given to one
I think seven or eight
But no one in the village knows better about the land than I
Yes because the Government wanted seamen and fishermen to fill up the navy in time of need
From the houses and he took the best of the houses too
In this very village
No ho would not take feuduty at all
Every lawyer and every clergyman was against us at that time
It was our duty to give notice to the nearest clergyman and we went to the minister of Applecross and Lochcarron and when they got the thing they got as small as tailors
Yes they got as small as tailors and if these people would stand as men they would have been alive
Yes he came to the village about
Yes and he knows more about the land than I do because I am not working the land but am a seaman and fisherman
I think he knows more about his own businesswhat was that but work the land
We want to have the village given us under Her Majestys rules and byelaws as it was given from His Majesty George III and the Lords in Council
And that our houses would be given back and allowing us to build boats and vessels to go to sea
There has not been a fishing boat in the village for twentythree years back and we have no vessels for carrying anything back and forward to us and the country was in a miserable state before the railway was opened nothing more
Although the people would get good crofts in this country it is of no use to give them crofts unless the village is given to the parish it is for the benefit of the parish that His Majesty granted the site
Our people are thinking if they get crofts they will get oats
No such thing unless they change the seed and the country to get seed from is Ireland and Kintyre for potatoes
Every inch of ground is marked out for seed and potatoes for this country and every inch of ground from the mouth of the Bann to the mouth of the Belfast Lough for oats
It is worked out to us for oats
Although you get Scotch oats in this country they will grow but they will not grow meal
One measure of Irish oats is better than two of our own
And Ireland is good but unless you change seed every three years it is a poor country and the same with us
And to get the village would be a great benefit to the people
A lady belonging to the place was the writer but we ourselves are the authors of it
Yes these are the genuine signatures of the people
No
It is from him I buy my seed oats and guauo
I have taken these things from him as a crofter for the last five years and if I could get them cheaper anywhere else I would go there
No not particularly because it is supplied by the factor but because it turns out well every year
I would take it from the one that I could get it best from and cheapest
We heard it remarked about a week ago and we were afraid it might be brought up and we thought if it were brought up the effect of it would be that he would cease to supply us
I cannot exactly tell about that but I know that it is from him that I get my own supplies
It is quite possible that if it were entirely in the hands of the factor it might be the worse for usthat is quite possible but at present there is opposition and perhaps I may get advantage of it
That might be but when there are a good number of merchants as there are there is opposition and we get the advantage we go to the cheapest man
I think he is
I cannot tell who the traders referred to are but we heard that traders were complaining that he was injuring their trade and we did not want that he should be put down because we considered him the better man
Not as delegates that I am aware of
The reason of getting up the paper was that we heard the matter was to be taken up as against the factor today and we thought perhaps the effect of it might be used against him in such a way that he would cease to trade and we consider him the best trader of them all
For five years I have been taking supplies from the same man and I would not get credit from another man
I cannot name any man who wan to have taken up the matter today
We were told the matter was to be taken up in the interests of the local merchants
Yes and they have the right to make it here
I did not hear it
Forty years ago it was before Sir Kenneths time
Forty years ago it was before Sir Kenneths time

Yes
The young people wish for more land and the old people wish for cheap land as cheap as it was when their fathers possessed it
The young people wish for more land and the old people wish for cheap land as cheap as it was when their fathers possessed it
Yes they would expect that but they dont see the land suitable for them within reach
Yes they would expect that but they dont see the land suitable for them within reach
The regulation is that if the next door crofter should be a suitable man and could take up the croft it would be added to his
But it almost always happens that it is given to another man
The wish of Sir Kenneth would be to increase the crofts

Fishing of all kinds and anything else that may turn up
So far as I can judge of that I am not a very good farmerthe land is not so good as it was some ten years ago
It has been successively cropped since I was a boy at least
The amount of the arable land is so small that we cannot give any portion of it rest
There are a few who are beginning now and again to leave portions of it out to rest in the belief that the remaining portion will yield better crops than the whole would have done by continuous cropping

I have heard of it before
I believe he has some land about his house but not a large extent of it
I believe he has some land about his house but not a large extent of it
I can tell very little about it but I remember his buying two cows in my own place and I know the people who sold them were not in arrears or in debt and that they rather pressed him to buy them than otherwise
I cannot tell anything more about it

If he oppressed them in any way it would be quite prudent of them to complain of it
If he oppressed them in any way it would be quite prudent of them to complain of it
No I have not
At present I think the price of the wood is very low much lower than what it was some years ago
I cannot say
I have never sold any wood my wood is all young but I think it is all low
Yes and the trees are quite young
It thrives very well in some parts but I have planted it in rather bad soil
I think however planting would do a great deal of good to the country
I think so
I have heard that the market is not good for any kind of wood not very good
Yes all the new houses are good compared with what they were
It should
No I have planted but little altogether
If I had more money I should like to plant thousands of acres but it is rather expensive work
A great deal
That can be seen in Loch Broom which will give work for many years and it has given a good deal of employment in Gairloch for many years
Yes
Yes for the posts
Very much every body wants fences even the crofters
Except when people are using iron entirely
In this wet climate wood soon rots when it is not good
I am to a small extent
About eight hundred cheviots
There is no doubt about it
Because the sheep feed during the day time and go up and lie on the rocks at night and leave the manure there whereas cattle always lie on the best places at night
Yes but I have only lately taken to cattle
It is certainly useful to the pasture but I dont know that there will be much profit made out of them
Pure West Highland
We have not tried them here but it is a very good cross
Nobody in this parish
I dont think it is very likely it is so troublesome to be constantly buying in fresh Highland heifers
I dont think that is a very good system getting cross bulls to the cross cows
It has not been found good with sheep
A great improvement
Yes four times what they got thirtyfive years ago
Very little indeed
Very little
I give a little and Mr Bankes used to give a little but nothing to benefit the people in any way
A good deal for a short time
Some of them have gardeners
Yes a good many are employed by hotel keepersthey are employed as boatmen for the fishermen
Yes it has raised the prices
About d a dozen
I remember then getting d a dozen
One shilling
That was a mistake he certainly did not
He has no privilege whatever
Every one
I dont think there is very much in the parish
There is a great deal of land under sheep available for planting but I dont think there is any under deer
Very little of Gairloch or of Kinlochewe
Yes very large magnificent trees
Almost all Scotch fir but some oak
No
About  acres
None of it except Kernsery
To Sir George Mackenzie of Coul
Yes
I think there were three sets of tenants removed within the memory of man
Yes
Where there is a great depth of wet peat you would require to remove that or drain it before trees would grow because the trees are mostly on the hard the peat has grown since
Yes
There are a great many hard bits that would grow Scotch fir
I meant to say I did not think the deer forests in Gairloch were suitable probably from their being on the higher ground and poor soil
Yes
Yes
No I dont think so
We are always liable to poverty
I should suggest that they should be encouraged to emigrate and that fishing villages should be made
Yes
I think Melvaig and Laid
Yes there are three large crofter townships there which might be made much more comfortable if they had a pier
I think the Laid one might but that at Melvaig would be more costly
There is a rock which runs out and if there were a little bit put out at right angles from it  it might make a good breakwater
Laid is about three miles from Aultbea
I think it would
I think they would be better fishers and the others would be better crofters
I should say not very much
There is one place at Isle Horrisdale where the people are more energetic
I dont think they are very energetic at present
It is difficult to say what the reason is
They had very little land there they were on an island and had only a bit of potato land and generally no cow I think
No
The schoolmaster of the place
Yes
Yes the greater number are away
Some are at Wick some at Fraserburgh and some at Peterhead
Yes the old go too
There is no better site than in the bay of Laid
This side of the bay
It opens to the north and northeast
Yes
Yes we have large boats but they are away at the fishing just now
There are three or four large boats belonging to the place
Yes
 or thereabout
Much the same as the Wick and Peterhead boats
Six
There are five that have shares in the boat and they hire the sixth man
If there is any winter fishing in the lochs they go to fish there
They have the boats up high and dry in the winter
All quays cost money but there would be an admirable basin within it if a quay were built where I have mentioned
Yes there are very good stones  it might do very well
No
If there were such a quay the loss of life would not be so great
We remember a boat full of herring being brought in and she could not make a landing here and they attempted to round the point and were never heard of more
Never
Well he put a bit of a quay up in the place where the steamer calls a small place where a vessel can scarcely come in at all times of the tide
Yes a quay that would afford safety for the big boats
There are about ten boats belonging to the district but they cannot approach the shore when the wind blows from the north
Twenty
Yes it would suit the district about as well
Boats of thirty or forty feet keel
Twentyfive or thirty feet when I was young and now they are thirtyfive to forty
They were open when I was young now they are decked
I consider the decked boat the best the most powerful
Fourteen to eighteen feet keel boats
Lobster and long line fishing and all sorts of fish about the shore
No none smaller than fourteen feet
Yes
Larch fir we get them from Wick and Peterhead
Since  the year of the destitution
Not for the last ten years
I am
Except for the three first years
I was at one time but I have not been going so much amongst them of late
When I first came to the country it was in a transition state and the people did not depend so much upon manual labour as they do now
They depended upon their crofts and fishing and the country was isolated there were no roads into it
Loch Maree road which opened up the country has been made since
Since the potato famine the people have not depended so entirely on the crofts and fishing but have betaken themselves more to manual labour
Yes I think there is about fifty for every one who went at that time
Ross Moray Banff and even Ayrshire and some to Roxburgh
They do
Some stay a great many years and some return again and some only stay for six months
The great majority of them only stay six months and return to work their crofts
Some go in spring perhaps about the end of April but most go in May to the feeing markets
Very considerably
I think so
I have in dress and education and everything there is a great improvement
I think their food is very much improved
More meal is imported into the country and I think they live better than they did in former days
Oatmeal especially from Banff and Aberdeenshire
No not much fish is principally used amongst them
Yes a great improvement
Yes I have
Yes
Yes I know most of the places
In some instances there may be cause for them
If you could mention any of the grievances I could speak to them
One of the grievances was seaware
They are very much dependent upon that for their crofts but these farmers are just as dependent
You may say it is an additional rent what they pay for artificial manures
Previous to my coming a civil engiueer from Banffshire laid out the property into crofts and I think it was he who put the rent upon the crofts the seaware was allocated to different townships at that time
No I know of nothing
Of course it is natural that the crofters should wish their crofts enlarged but I think it would be much better if a number of them were made labourers and made dependent on their labour and fishing villages created as they have been on the east coast
I know Sir Kenneth has been endeavouring as the crofts fell vacant to enlarge the crofts of those remaining and there are some in this neighbourhood who have two crofts instead of one and I think they are much more comfortable than those who have only one croft
I dont think their hill pasture is properly managed they dont keep proper shepherds
I think so
I have often advocated club farms such as they have in Skye and Applecross  I think they are a great improvement upon this system
There would be a little because some of the crofters are poorer than others and they would not be able to pay for their proportion of the stock
Yes
The small crofter would then lose his proper proportion of the profits
I refer to hill stock
That would be so but he pays the same rent for the arable land and I think it is an advantage to have a proportionate share of the hill
But each arable croft should carry a full share of the hill farm
Now say there is a good profit on sheep two sheep wont yield the same as five
Yes and I say the share of the hill ground is twenty sheep and the crofter having only five would be at a disadvantage with the other man who had twenty even although the rent was less of course he would not have the profit that the sheep yield
Yes but I think the smaller crofter would be at a disadvantage
I think it would be better if the crofters could have an equal number of cows and sheep sheep at any rate
Yes
No difficulty
Yes
Yes
I think there would be a great many of them not able to put stock on
Yes
No
They do
Yes
Yea I am aware there were two or three such villages some time ago but like others they got very anxious to possess land and I dont think they have prospered or done bettor than they did when they had only a small bit of arable land
Yes
In Applecross they compare pretty wellI think they are doing much better in Applecross
I may mention a fact in regard to Applecross which occurred some time ago
Lord Middleton purchased my wether lambs and some of his club tenants were competitors with him and offered within d of his price
They sent a shepherd and a headman from the club farm across for the purpose of purchasing the lambs
It does indeed
I am not so well acquainted with Skye but I know of many club farmers in Skye selling wool to great advantage in Inverness
I was
I was
I was
It was more severe because labour was not plentiful in the country at the time
The people could not get work and they were not accustomed to work
Although the potatoes failed them that year the cereals did not they did not lose them us they did last year
In October last there was a gale of wind which destroyed almost all the cereals in the country
I am not sure that the failure was so great but it was nearly so the failure in cereals was greater last year
Yes
On account of their being able to get employment
The spring fishing turned out very well and labour was more plentiful throughout the country and not only so here but a great many went elsewhere
In some of the farms they were making roads and the proprietor was offering them labour he offered to give them employment
Yes
No I dont think so
I think it was more owing to the peoples being better able to do something for themselves
In some parts of the parish they may have done so but in others they have not
I dont think they have as a whole accumulated more wealth
No I think they are better accustomed to labour now than they were then
I think so
Yes they are using tea
Yes
It has
No because I do not think tea is used to such an extent as to be prejudicial
It is fish they use principallythey dont use much meat
Yes
No
I think a low type of disease is prevalent in all parts of Scotland at present
It has been prevailing more than it did in former years
I do but not in this county
I am a native of Aberdeenshire
I do
Well I dont think it has been a very great misfortune
I think the people especially of the west coast used potatoes and fish and now they use more bread I mean they depended more on the potato crop than now and when the potato failure came they felt it the more
I do
The great part of them was after I came into the country
The clearances were very harsh at the time  but I think those left behind are in a better position than they would have been their crofts are larger and I think they are more comfortable than they would have been had the clearances not taken place
In some degree they did
I think so
Sand
They were
Yes
Often
I could not state how many there were previously but I know there are not so many there now
There have been a great many houses pulled down and the crofters now have what arable land belonged to these houses previously
In almost all the townships there a number of crofters were removed and those remaining possess the land
A portion of the hill pasture I have no doubt was taken from them and Drumchork was added to the sheep farm
I am not aware whether or not there was any hill pasture taken from them there  I rather think not
Yes
It is in a great measure due to external resources
No I think it is in great part owing to the crofters and their families to what they earn in other parts of the world
We are paying rent for the hill pasture and for the lots and that is difficult for us to do
We think we should have the hill pasture along with the lots when the lots were taken first the hill pasture went along with them
The town in which I am and the adjacent one were in the hands of eighteen tenants before they were lotted out
They paid  each and they had a horse nine milk cows and twenty sheep each
Now the whole of this is divided into forty lots and about thirty families
What we wish is that the hill pasture should go along with the croft as before or else to get more land in order that we may have more room
The hill pasture is very bad it would have been better if the one half of it had been a sheet of water instead of being dry ground
If it were so it would not destroy our stock as it does
It is a very unhealthy place for stock and it is also full of peat haggs where they are drowned
Stock can only graze upon it four months in the year it is very unhealthy
I defy anyone present to say he ever saw hill pasture so bad
I have travelled over many a one but I never saw one so bad
Where shall I go
If I could only get it
There is a forest which marches with our hill pasture
Yes
At least for the last twenty years back perhaps more
It is very good sheep ground
There is no comparison between the two
About thirtysix years ago
I cannot tell whether it was a Mr Anderson or Mr Macrae
The estate was under trustees and perhaps the management was not so very good
Two cows and five sheep and two or three young cattle but the land cannot support them
I have  no horse
 to   for arable ground and hill pasture combined
Just the year when the place was allotted
Everybody that has a croft has the right to put a beast upon this pasture and we pay so much for every head we put on
I think there will be about fifty families that have a share upon the hill
The rub is thisthere are s for every cow s for a stirk and Is d for a sheepa calf or a lamb goes free
Yes when it is upon the lots that we pasture them except for a short time when they are out upon the hill
Yes I think it is  some of them are twice as high as they should be
I dont think so
Sir Kenueth has not raised the rents except when there has been a change of tenancy one or two of them may have got a slight increase of rent
But there was interest to be paid upon money expended upon them and that increased the rent
Trenching and draining
Some of it was done by the people to whom the lots belonged  the other was done by outsiders
Yes
Yes
They paid the rent for it which is still exacted
A good number I cannot exactly tell
It varies very much
Some of them pay about s or about Is for every   expended but I dont pay any myself and cannot give the exact figures
Thirtysix years ago and they continued for five or six years
We were promised at the time that this charge should cease at the end of twenty years
On the portion of it which belongs to this estate of Sir Kenneth Mackenzie it is about four miles long by three broad
Yes he has a farm in Shieldaig
Yes
The crofters had at one timebut beyond my timea portion of the forest afterwards that portion of ground was made into a sheep farm and then it was made into a forest
W pay  s including taxes for the croft and last year I paid close upon   for the hill
There is no restriction so far as that is concerned  I may send as many as I please
I would only have three of them next year if I left them there
They cannot keep much stock upon it  the ground is very unhealthy
Every man tries to keep upon it as much stock as he can but instead of the stock increasing it decreases
The greater the stock upon the hill the greater the rent to the proprietor but I am not prepared to say that the greater the amount of stock the worse for the crofters because we have them there only for four years altogether
There is a fixed rent for the pasture over the hill of about  but the average rent it yields every year is about   every person meanwhile being entitled to put as many beasts as he pleases on it  and I dont think the people ever restrict the number of beasts which they are to put on as a matter of fact people put as much on as it will hold but it is a bad place
It appears that the proprietor does not get more than the stated rent for when the number of the animals increases the rate per animal decreases for it is only a stated rent that goes to the proprietor at the beginning
For instance the ordinary average rate is s per cow but in the event of their being a large number on the hill it might be down to s d
The average area of arable is from  to  acres the summing is two cows and a young beast and about sixteen sheep
 s to  would be the average but it ranges from  to 
It is the worst crofts that are cheapest
They were all valued by a surveyor at the time the rents were fixed
The rents were fixed in  or  When the present manager came about twenty years ago the rents were slightly reduced  some slightly raised and some slightly reduced
Yes the rent of the place is about what it was forty years ago
No
There are a few in the Strath that have been subdivided since that time I cannot tell about the rest of the estate
By what they make off the outcome of the stock by labour and the proceeds of the fishingespecially the  fishing
Yes very much
Yes
I cannot say that the proceeds of the fishing have increased
They dont make more out of the herring fishing anyhow but there is the cod and ling fishing
The prices of those fish are better and probably they will make more out of that than they did
That is quite the case
The crop of the croft is practically worthless it has changed very muchit has changed almost entirely within that period
I have a croft myself of  acres and I have not sent a grain of oats to the mill for the last three years only I sold three barrels of oats last year of the proceeds of the previous year and I have only one head of cattle and I only kept one cow before
If I had kept more stock I would have required to buy about twenty stooks of corn for each head of stock
The weather may have had something to do with it but the land is poor and stony and rocky
The portion of the seashre which is set apart for the crofters is nearly worthless for seaware it does not grow upon the rocks there and the rest of the seaware round about the coast belongs to the farmers
Yes I think when a farmer gets a lease he gets the right to the seaware upon his own shore in the lease to the whole of his own shore
Undoubtedly
The price was s for the load of a boat of  feet keel or Id for every creelfull
Yes and it would improve our crofts very much for nothing makes better crofts than manuring the land with seaware
We have spoilt our crofts by manuring with guano from the want of seaware
There was always a complaint about it which they might have heard
No there was no need he would not give it to us it is not likely he would
I only went to a few of them
There were some who refused and some who gave the seaware
Sixty hours in the year
No
No
It has certainly existed since  since I took a croft
Yes he can provide a substitute of course at his own expense
Perhaps s d or s
There was some of it done upon the proprietors ground but it is chiefly upon the roads there is scarcely anything done now to the property it is all upon the roads
Yes the branch roads
Yes there is also some of it used in repairing the march fences between ourselves and the big farmers
Yes he just makes a share the big farmer only builds a crofters share of the dykean equal share with one crofter
When one builds a house he gets the wood for the roof and according to the estate regulations which are printed if a crofter is in possession of a croft for twenty years there is no compensation given for the house even supposing he had expended  or  upon it
No
I dont require to ask the permission of the proprietor to build a house the houses were built when the crofts were let
If it were in disrepair I should begin to do it and I should go to the proprietor and ask for the wood for the roof
Always
There are no slated houses we just get the wood for the roof
I am repairing my own house just now
Supposing I were to fell it to the ground it would cost about  to build it again in addition to what assistance I might get from the proprietor
About  s or 
 The tenant
I cannot very well tell because I only entered into possession myself in  but ever since Sir Kenneth Mackenzie became proprietor of the estate there have been scarcely any sent away
He is a very kind landlord
No nothing
Yes there has been such a process  the last instance of it was ten years ago
Just a bit that was taken from the better side of the hill and added to the adjacent farm
Ye
It made the march rather more correct than before but the reason was that the farmer wished to get it  he did not get exactly all he asked all the same
No
Well it was large enough to become an object of desire to that farmer anyhow j if it had not been worth money he would not have set his eye upon it
It is a good large bit and it is one of the best portions of the pasture although I cannot tell the acreage of it
Yes we have good neighbours we have no complaints to make on that score
None whatever
Yes indeed it is
We did our share of it  we dont know whether it was the proprietor or the tenant who did the other share
Auchtercairn
Dr Robertson
No it is not very large there are no large farms
No
Except that I like to have a cow and a house I would have nothing to do with a croft if it were not for these and the potato ground it would be of no service to me
I have made the calculation several times and I have the idea that I could buy in the market as much as my croft produces cheaper than by the labour expended in producing it on the croft
Yes I sell nothing else
It was a loss not a kindness
No
No
The people are left very much to their own free will in that respect but they are a sober people not only in the place but all over the country
The rule was laid down not because the people were not a sober people but in order to put them upon their guard that in the event of anyone being found so he would have to leave the district
No
I am not paying anyhow and perhaps there are a few who do not pay it but the general rule upon the estate is to pay the rent beforehand
No that is not the way it is put in the books but as the crofts were allotted out first before they yielded crops the rent was paid and the thing was continued
There is that regulation but it is reversed in my case
I pay in Martinmas next for the crop of the year
I never heard it complained of
I cannot tell exactly but if he brings his horse he gets off for three days instead of six
I think not excepting statute labourthat is six days
We pay poor rates but we pay no road rates
I suppose so his own share of it
That our land is small and that in proportion to its value it is dear
The proprietor has not much to divide amongst us but there is a little and so the holdings might be a little enlarged
There are other modes in which the condition of the people might be improved
A community of fishermen might be planted in various places where nobody dwells in for example the two islands of Longa and Horrisdale
I would send three or four crews to one place and they could have a cow and an acre or two acres of land for each family
Yes if the fishing would continue as at present they would be better off in that way  and these islands I speak especially of Longaare accessible and convenient for the fishing industry
The tenant is Mr Macdonald and the proprietor is Sir Kenneth Mackenzie
No nothing
There are markets in the place
Yes and at Tollie halfway between this and Gairloch
Two
I cannot get everything I want but I get the common necessaries meal and groceries and clothes and boots
Both people are of the name of Macpherson
A long time
I know nobody who keeps meal but the manager
Mr Mackenzie
Yes he sells oats and guano
Nothing unless maybe a head of cattle now and again
No  he is just exactly like any drover so far as I know  he does not care
Yes I sold him a cow last year
I got almost all I asked for it
I never heard the tenants complain of it among themselves but I believe it is a matter of complaint with the other dealers whose custom is spoiled
I cannot tell
It would be quite easy for other people to do it and the more that other traders get of the traffic the more they would like it
I dont think it would
No
Not that I have heard of
I cannot tell
I think every trader trades for his own benefit but he may benefit the community as well
I believe they are not quite clear of arrears but I dont know that their arrears were ever less than they are now
Yes but that arose from the loss of the crops last autumn  and the potatoes were quite a failure
Yes and they got assistance and it was of service when it came into the country
Yes I think it was necessary I dont know what the condition of some of the people who got assistance would have been without it
Yes
Not with the whole of it
He said he had no fault to find with the neighbouring tenants in their treatment of the crofters stock
I remember the crofters stock being poinded by the neighbouring tenant on one occasion
When I was a small boy I used to herd my fathers stock upon the portion of the hill pasture which has been taken from the crofters and given to the farm of Auchtercairn and if the cattle strayed over the march at that time they would be poinded
Since that time I have seen cattle coming from the grazing upon the other side that is the place called Little Sanda and these were poinded also and many of the people to whom they belonged were from home at the time
No
Yes when I was there
I remember upon the occasion of the inspection of the local volunteers at Dingwall that some of the crofters cattle were thrown down and carried away to the pound
Perhaps nine or ten years
With respect to the statute labour not only is it done upon roads and upon fences as the other delegate stated but I am of opinion that I may have seen it being done upon the fence between the arable ground and the hill pasture of the farmerthat was a fence not upon the march of the crofter at all 
No I was a householder
I have a fifty years lease of the house
No not of the lease of the house  but in the event of my doing it it is stated that I would get other privileges right to peat ground and seaware
I have not done it
I only pay s of ground rent and I think s in addition for statute labour is an excessive sum
Upon the farm of Sandabeg there was a regulation made within the last few years that anyone who in future should cut peats there must pay s a year for every bank that he might cut now the people used to cut peats there in former times free of charge
Yes
I cannot tell the number present but I can tell the way in which the meeting was called
The crofters of the Strath had a preliminary meeting
I was not present at that meeting but at the second meeting I was present and one of the members proposed my name as a delegate to appear before your Lordship and the Commissioners
There might have been thirty or forty
I could not say how many but I can say that so far as I know only three people were present who were not croftere themselves at one time or sons of crofters
The three exceptions were the chairman the Rev
Mr Mackenzie Dr Robertson and Mr Lamont the schoolmaster
Yes
Maybe about fifty
I am not sure that half the people were present they were not at home to be present
It was during the summer fishing season
At present they are at the east coast fishing
Yes
No
I cannot tell I never asked an explanation
I dont know any motive they might have unless that they thought I would just say what they wished
There were no strangers present
 The principal grievances of which the crofters complain are the smallness of their holdings the insecure manner in which they are held and that under the present estate regulations they cannot expect any compensation for improvement as they limit and restrict compensation to such an extent that at the end of twenty years none whatever is granted a state of things which we consider to be entirely wrong for we hold that the proprietor has no right to appropriate the value of the tenants improvements after the lapse of any number of years
The hill and pasture has undergone a process of curtailing to gratify the farmers on both sides without any reduction in the rent but when a piece was taken off the farm of Shieldaig held by the Marquis of Bristol the rent was reduced according to valuation
Present rents are too high
The township of Strath paying including hill rent estate labour and rates something like  and if the estate labour was exacted according to estate regulation the sum would be considerably higher
Estate labour should be entirely abolished
The seaweed which grows without trouble to anyone is mostly in possession of large farmers who do not require what they have of it and the crofters not being allowed a sufficient quantity have to buy of them
Strath of Gairloch
About four acres
I wish to state now that so far as I knew it was not that I was able to give the best information that they put me forward
The time was rather short and I have not the exact totals or the like of that but I have no doubt it is all made up in the managers statement
So far as I know the summing is two cows and about sixteen sheep
Yes and sixteen or twenty sheep
Some of them keep horses but very few
I am not aware of any restriction
The rents vary very muchfrom  up to 
According to the value placed upon them
Yes
My father occupied one of the dearest crofts in the Strathnumber one croft in the Strathit came to about  or 
I did not think of speaking of the average so far as I have found them
I should think some of them are worth about   an acre a few may be higher that would be about  a croftfrom  to 
Very few are subdivided
I cannot give the exact number of years ago but there are two other delegates present from the Strath older than I am who can give most of the information
Our hill pasture was valued by Robertson Keanchulish and MMartin Leckmelm at  or s per cow
At that time feuars could keep any number of cows on the hill for s each now they pay s for first and s for every one above that number
Strangers evicted from other places keep cows and sheep on the hill and consequently feuars cattle are ill used
The hotel ground is walled in and their cattle should graze in common with others but the best part of the hill is kept for their use and other cattle going there are worried by their dogs
Feuars are not allowed to keep sheep all sheep on hill being those of strangers
The people coming in from other properties are troubling us by taking our hill pasture from us
There never was any right to the Ullapool tenants to have sheep
Mr Mackay and the factor and the chamberlain and Mr Munro the local factor put up a paper ordering the sheep to be removed but that has not been done
We think we are charged too much for the grazing of our cows
Formerly we paid five shillings and now we have to pay ten shillings
We have only a little hill and there are too many cattle on it
There are ten horses on it
It is as much as there is of it if there is a square mile and a half
Not for the sheep
That was never done it is the people in the town that these sheep belong to
There are no fences
Because there is no land round about it for the people and the fishing has not succeeded as it used to do
This ground I have got in my own hands as it adjoins ground in my own possession  but there are two tenants yet
With regard to this poor fellow I may mention that when he got to Glasgow he ran short he had only two shillings when he went on board ship
He wrote me two lines saying he wished I was there
He got on with his family but I fortunately took the precaution to give him a letter to the Emigration Society
I did not know who they were but I gave him that letter simply states that he was a decent good fellow very poor and that I was afraid he would land in poverty in America and that if he called at their office they might rely on what he stated
He did call at the office
He had  miles to go up the country and they sent him forward and provisions along with him
He got on very well at first but the poor feHow was killed by a tree which he was cutting down
I have still about a quarter of an acre of land at Leckmelm
Leckmelm was long ago divided into four townships
Three of them were under crofters and one of them was a farm tack
The people were welloff at that time
One of the townships where there were four people paid about  of rent
In another township there were eight people who paid  between them  and there was a third township called Incroash which was divided amongst three tenants who sublet to three other tenants making altogether in the township six people
I dont know the rent of that third township
The subtenants paid  of rent
In the year  every person upon the estate was summoned out of his building
The two central townships were then lotted out into thirteen lots
In the township in which there were six tenants these six were thrown in amongst the other thirteen tenants who had the two townships
In these two townships there are now twenty in all
Seven full lots were given to seven of those twenty and the rest was divided among the other thirteen at that time the land was rather disjointed a patch here and there with a heap of stones now and again right in through it
When the lots were apportioned out among them in this way the people began to clear the stones off the surface of the land and to improve and cultivate it so as to make it one continuous ground and improve it in every way as they were able
Another township was cleared in order to make room for the innkeeper that was in Strathmore and a portion of the hill which the tenants had at the time was taken from them and added to the farm which was given to the innkeeper
But still the rent was kept on the township after the hill was taken from them
The people were in this condition until the year  In that year three townships were cleared in Strathmorethat is upon the Braemore estateand some of these were thrown in among the tenants of Leckmelm some of the existing tenants in those townships were sent away without the proprietors knowledge
The proprietor was at the time away on the Continent
Mr Davidson of Tulloch
When the proprietor came back he began to ask me what had become of those people and when I told him he replied that the thing had been done without his knowledge
In the following year a cold wind came into the land which has still remained and that was the division that arose among the people in consequence of the Disruption
Then the son of this innkeeper who was settled among us was appointed factor upon the estate or rather manager over the whole estate and messages used to come from him and the ground officer to the effect that unless all the people should go to the church to which they were wont to go they would be removed from the estate and it was alleged this was the proprietors order
There were some that obeyed this order but others refused to obey knowing where they could get the milk and that when they got it they would drink it sweet This state of affairs continued for thirtyfour years
The people still continued to improve the land and clear the surface of it of stones but only some of us cleared it all
Then the young proprietor who was at that time living on a portion of Strathmore thought it proper to come and add to our rents
Over  was added to the rental of the place at that time making the rent over  Then a black day for the Highlanders came round after that when the schools were placed under the control of the State
Then we began to quarrel as to who should be elected members of the School Board
Mr Davidson was then at Innerbroom and our young proprietor became a candidate thinking that everybody who had a vote in Leckmelm ought to give the vote to himself
There were seven properly qualified electors at that time but through a change of tenancy and the like of that there happened to be only at that date of legally qualified voters five
Mr Davidson only got four votes in Leckmelm and he got angry with us and increased the rent by  again so that the rent thus became over 
Just that same year I think
I think  if I am not mistaken
The place was rented at  I suppose then over  and then over 
Yes
About sixteen
There are sixteen still who hold bits of land from the proprietor
No not at first but we were afterwards
 s at the first
When the lots were first given
 on the whole lot and  on the half lot
I think seven
Yes
They were allowed by the proprietor more than they were able to winter
They were allowed four cattle and two followers or three cattle and three followers as they liked
One horse each
Twentyfour for each lot
They were in a comfortable position some of them those who had the full lots but not those in the half lots
Not ablefar from that I have seen me some years when paying the high rent buy as much as between thirteen and fourteen bolls of meal for my family
Yes
I was
Sometimes but the failure of the potatoes was very bad
The failure in the potato crop
Some years more than others
Oh 
yes by buying some meal but never without that
Yes
No
No far from that but I might be worse than I am
I daresay I will get that if I like but I am glad he is here there are things he is not aware of
I went to work two years ago in the garden for the manager and I continued there for about a month
For the days I wrought I was paid sixteen shillings
Next month I worked out moreI had more days and before I was paid the Fast Day in connection with the Established Church came round and I went to the garden and commenced to work not being aware that it was the Fast Day
The manager came into the garden where I was but never said I was doing wrong or doing little
He was quite agreeable all the time I had been working there but he came in and said  This will not do
 What is wrong
I said  Do you know this is the Fast Day
 It is singular said I that would be unknown to me
I t is says he
Where
says I
 In the church says he  up there
 That is in the parish says I
 Yes says he
 Yes says I   but the day we parted with the Established Church we parted with it and all its  eremonies I said I am not going to quarrel with you over my work do your work when you like
None will be working here today he said
I then went home and commenced my own work
The same day he had to go to the hill himself and look about the marches with the factor pretending he was going to church and he was not there
In the course of a few days after that the pay day came round and when I was paid I took the money given to me and went away and on looking at the amount of money I found I was two shillings in the week less
Next day when we met he asked me how much money I had got
I took my passbook out of my pocket and told him the number of days and the amount of money I had received marked at the end
He said  That is it
I said are you going to give me more
 No he said
I said  You reduced me two shillings a week and he said  That will be your wages
I said  Why did you not tell me before
I am sure he never heard of it until now
The manager then came round and gave me a lot of curses and said  I dont care whether you be willing or not
 I am not willing says I  and keep your swearing to yourself keep your mouth clean as a Christian speaking to another and I went off and left him there
One day I had a piece of work I had not finished and I went and finished it and left him and did not work any more till I was called last year and when I was called I did not give him an answer This year I was called again to work in the garden and I would be paid for it
When pay time came up he paid me according to the rule at the rate of sixteen shillings
I would take more if I could get it
I cannot tell you that exactly
Some of them get that
Yes when the weather permits since Mr Pirie got the place
Buy it from Mr Pirie
Yes when it will be
Yes likely when it will be they will get it
For that I was not caring I dont care much about hens
I am not very sure
Yes they were
I cannot say about that just now
Because they had too many and they were destroying the fields
I had one at that time and I think at the present time that one is still about the house
No but it might be worse of course for all we do Mr Pirie pays us
When we were giving over the sheep and crop and stock I asked the gamekeeper what reduction we were to get for the rent and said that surely the half years rent would be reduced
He said You are perfectly right and I will write about it   but it came round at the end that we had the whole half years rent gratis by Mr Piries orders
Just now for the site of the houses which belong to myself and for the piece of potatoes and liberty to cut peats we pay twelve shillings a year
I think so
It is rather too much I consider it is rather too little in a way  but it is high enough for the way we have it
Yes along with my father
Oh yes a great many
I cannot say there is none of them occupied by the tenants
No they are not all living there a good few of them died a few years ago old people
Some of the young people went away to New Zealand Australia Africa and India
I dont know
I am not aware of any family that went away altogether except one man who left about sixteen years ago for New Zealand with his whole family
His house was given to some person down from the strath
We wanted it from the factor but he would not give it to us
One family sixteen years ago
No nor for the improvement of land
Long before
Yes I was keeping under hay the most part of my lot
Just a fourth part of it
Yes but the last year I took it all except the fourth part of the larger lot
Yes
About their means I cannot say but I believe some of them have no means
Yes there are some on the estate who have no ground at all but they were not in the books of the proprietor
I know there were but I dont know whatever there are any now I think there are two still
Not the least and never had that is what keeps things in the position they are
We are dependent on the goodwill of the proprietor
Part of it
Most of my land was below the road but when we built the house about  the road was made through the place and we never got anything for that
Yes all the dykes were built about it and still are
Some of them were rubbishy built as they were in a hurry to get the stones out of the field and they were building them without using a hammer
I put up part of it
No not a penny
I built a dyke on both sides of the road so long as I had to do with it
Close to the side borders we were willing to save as much of the land as we could
I am not sure
No
I think so
The man is not able to work and had not much stock to give over at the time of the valuation
He was lame
Yes
Yes
Yes I do
 The extent of the parish of Loch  Broom is about forty miles square the proportion of arable land in this whole area is not proportionate to its extent chiefly because it is a mountainous and pastoral country but such as there is if properly laid out for the benefit of the people and not on behoof of wild beasts there is enough to rear up a very large population in comfort and happiness
There are in all it is supposed under cultivation at present about  acres but how much that was once cultivated and sustaining a prosperous tenantry could be reclaimed again any one who walks the parish  may see
At the last census the population of the parish was  in  it was  in  it was  in  it was  Thus it is seen that the population of the district is steadily decreasing
This is owing first to the gradual moving of the young to other centres of industry and secondly to emigration which has largely decimated this parish and were it not for the influx from other parishes to the village of Ullapool and other parts of the parish the population would be much smaher than it is
Of this population about  hold crofts besides cottars and such as hold plots of land attached to their houses which cannot be called crofts
These crofts hold an average of three acres of land some have more and some less
They have all between them something about  acres
These crofters who are mostly at the same time fishermen are poor and gradually becoming poorer both through the failure of the fishing industry and the crops as was the case last year
When you add to this increasing rents and heavy rates with a poor rate of s d in the pound besides school rates road money police rates and as in the village water rates it is easily seen that a people having a small and precarious income have enough to do
There are in all about  registered poor besides  casual poor in the parish
The cost of supporting these amounts yearly to about  This is a very heavy burden on a people whose burdens are otherwise numerous enough
Besides this there are ministers and a doctor to keep up
The rental of the parish is  s d
There are several smaller subjects farms twentyfour in the parish at rentals from  to  covering an area of fully  acres arable land with hill grounds adjoining
These are fairly comfortable and there are six large sheep farms the highest of a rental of  One of them is without a tenant 
And of deer forests there are seven covering at least  acres
Much of this is high hill pasture but all of it well adapted for sheep and cattle and much of it could with advantage be still utilised for grazing either separate from or in connexion with the low ground and much also of these glens was under tillage and covered with cornfields and a happy tenantry
Take for example Rhidorroch itself
That glen is six or seven miles long
It was at one time under cultivation and could maintain scores of families in comfort but now like most of the best of the land in this parish it is turned into a deer forest I have a sketch of the evictions which took place from sixty to seventy years ago in this parish beginning at the big strath but with your leave I want to state some of the grievances and immediate causes of the poverty of the people
The area occupied first of all is too narrow that is one of the causes and it is true of Ullapool and if any of the delegates are examined they will enter into this grievance themselves
Secondly there is the unfruitfulness of the soil and the untoward nature of the seasons
Thirdly the fishing industry has failed
Combined with these there is the distance to the markets from the fishing ground so that the fish lose their value before they reach their destination
To show how our people are being impoverished gradually there were ten years ago eighteen large boats fit to go to the east coast fishing there are now only eight except crazy boats which ply around the coast here
Again among the grievances there is first the want of roads in some of the country districts particularly two places on the Dundonell estate
No doctor or messenger can get to these places except by sea and the children can only attend school at the risk of their lives
This must hinder the education of the children to some extent and make the attendance irregular
The next grievance is the distance of the medical officer from the people
The road round about is twentyfive miles long it could have been made ten miles by taking it through the Big Rocknot through the precipitous rock but round another way which would not have cost more than was expended upon the twentyfive miles
My idea is this that the road twentyfive miles long has been made mainly for the purpose of suiting the sportsmen  it is out of the way entirely for the people
The people must come and go through that Big Rock as heretofore
I am not going to blame any person but the fact is there
The road is useless for any of us although we have to go sometimes
That is the great grievance
Eight years  it is round about altogether
Then there is another grievance and the marrow of them we might say the insecurity of tenure  the people are afraid to lift their heads
They are tenants at will and they dont know at what moment they may be put out of their lots
In this state of things they have no independence they must just do as their superiors tell them however much it may be against their own light and sense of duty
The power of the factors and lairds appears to me as a millstone upon the people and my soul has been frequently pained by this incubus resting upon them which they have no power to throw off
This power ramifies itself into everythingSchool Boards Parochial Boards everything and anything
No freedom can be exercised without danger to the interests of the individuals
This power must be broken at whatever cost
It pains me to speak in that way but I cannot help it
It is not so much against the men that I speak as against the system on which they are working
As I said yesterday when intimating this meeting even although they should put myself in as factor I would be tempted to do some of the things that these men do two of them of my own congregation excellent men but the system under which they are working tempts even a good man to do it
As for Mr Gunn he is an excellent man and gentleman and I have been very glad to meet him in the Parochial Board a man who I believe would not do an unjust act but the system under which he and others are working makes them do what they would not
It is not with these gentlemen I quarrel but with the system under which they are working
If you wish to hear the history of the evictions sixty or seventy years ago I am quite willing to enter into that
Ten years
I have travelled through the most of the Western Highlands
I have been much in Sutherland and Caithness
I know Argyleshire well and the islands of Lewis and Skye and other portions
I have within a few years and incidentally before as a crofters son I might say and I know the question well by experience and since a few years ago I have been forced to pay attention to it
Yes
I have followed it as closely as I could and as my time would allow me
Yes I honestly say that  that they have not overdone it in my view
Yes that is one of the main reasons of their povertythe narrowness of the area which they occupy
Yes but under different arrangements
It will never do to give one man a little more and less to another
You must have club farms you must have one shepherd and one mark upon the sheep
It would never do to let one man get on and another sink down
I have no indictment to bring against the factors their position is a difficult one  but the great thing is the rentto supply the rent to the proprietors and other questions are lost sight of entirely
I am
Yes
No I would not because no scientific agriculture will do with hill pasture
It is the sheep on the hill pasture and the cattle that pay the farmer even the large farmer
Yes
Yes
It would never be done if the laws of the property were properly worked and I would insist upon that
Too indulgent a proprietor may spoil a tenantry as well as a despotic one
Things go to sixes and sevens where there is a too indulgent proprietor
Yes as in the Lewis
Things are allowed to go too much their own way and there is a lack of a proper guiding principle or rule
There must be rules and they must be exercised with a very firm hand I would insist upon thatand no subdivision
Yes to perhaps double or three times their extent
in that event with small lots they would get on very well
Oh no
I dont perhaps take you up the present hill pasture is it
Oh yes to be sure
If those grazings which were cut off by deer forests and sheep farms were given to the people even with the crofts they have they would be twenty times better off than they are
Everything depends on the stock in the Highlands
Yes if the proprietor would give the hills to the people the people would rise up ten degrees and more in prosperity
No doubt of it
There are a great many stretches that could be turned with the plough
The slopes of Inverlaul itself could be brought in a great part of them
They could not stock them unless they got some meansunless they got the loan of money some way
But could not the proprietor do that and get interest as Sir Alexander Matheson has done
Stock the ground and let the people pay up the stock and everything until they get upon their legs  and now they are going as gentlemen to the markets with gigs  they are as well off as the proprietors  themselves
That is the only feasible way I see of giving money to the people not to all but to the best
Some people cannot do anything but lounge
But let it be given to men who can use it  give them money and let them pay it back by degrees
We have scores in this parish who could do that
Yes
Yes under proper and just lawsif he would let club laws be administered and I would not say not to evict
I would evict a man who would not pay rent or who was guilty of a misdemeanour
You must have strict rules and abide by them and that would teach the people to be more diligent in their work
Yes that is the best way I could see
As to the working of a perpetual lease I first of all thought of a life lease
Then I saw that would end with a mans life and would not stand for his son
Then I changed the expression to a perpetual lease or fixity of tenure that is that no man should be put out of his holding except for  misdemeanour or not paying his rent
Well of course with club farms it would require to rise after perhaps a number of years  but there would require to be a sliding scale to regulate that which I cannot enter into at present
But although I dont go into any remedy except club farms I hold that our Highlands will never get on until our people have some individual interest in the land
Whether you can give them that interest by a club farm or not I cannot say
But whatever be the method of working I want more interest in the land that the people may settle down for ever if they wish to die there
Yes
My poor opinion is this that an independent person or court would be the proper way to fix the rent at different times when the restoration of the land should take place and that it should not be allowed to be in the hands of the factor and landlord that there should be some guiding principle for factors and lairds
It is a difficult thing and I only lay down a general principle but there are many other things which would require to be settled
This is the way I have seen it done and Lochiel knows this perfectly well the proprietor is tenant in place of the tenant that leaves
He takes everything and holds it as for the person who has left and when the fresh tenant comes in he gives it over to him and of course if the new tenant leaves he gives it back to the proprietor again so that the copartners have nothing whatever to dothey have no loss whatever
Yes
My own father held two shares
No
He might get the whole perhaps himself through time
 If things would allow it but it is not generally the case
No but when there is a croft vacant there are hundreds after it  and when you have a farm vacant today rented at  or  you cannot get an offer
But let there be a croft of from  to   vacant and you will get scores of offers
I know some of them and they are fairly comfortable every one of them showing that if you rise a little you will make the people comfortable
I differ from Mr Fowler on that point
Yes
No loss but gain I believe if deer forests were put out of the question
Mr Fowler himself has  acres of arable land and that could with great gain be put into the hands of the people
The proprietors consider it is better to have it in their own possession
But if you look to the prosperity of the country which is to have many stalwart people upon it it would be the best thing to give the land to the crofters
No
I have the figures from good sources and I understand there are  acres in the little strath and  in the big strath
Yes in the hands of the proprietors themselves  and about  in the hands of the crofters
Yes
Sixteen crofters in Leckmeln if I remember well and about one hundred souls
Each of them has about a quarter of an acre as garden ground
They are still most of them on the ground
They have their houses and their children are in the employment of Mr Pirie
I must say for Mr Pirie and I had to do with him as going to do what I considered wrong that he has proved a very kind master to the people under the new regime of things
A pretty large number of the young
Some have gone to America and they are scattering here and there just day by day
Oh yes  there are two men here who may be examined
The young have left
Yes long ago
There is only now a shepherds house and that place could maintain a number of families in comfort
It is upon the Duchess of Sutherlands property
There are many reasons for that
I did not go into this because there were other witnesses to be called but a great number of the people have come into the village of Ullapool
Yes it is commonly the refuge for these poor people and every one when he comes if he can keeps a cow by paying so much for it and consequently there is far too much stock upon the hill which is limited already
The reason of the impoverished state of the village is the number of poor people thrown into it and the breaking down of houses
There is no doubt of it and I told that to the members of the Parochial Board that they should try and prop up these men in the holdings instead of driving them out
Yes pretty well
Yes  acres and there is a farm worth  of rent vacant just now
Yes between the farm and what is in the hands of the proprietor and there is a very large deer forest
A very large amount but I could not give the exact acreage
I believe the whole put together is  worth about  of rent
Yes in Coigach
At the expense of a large sheepfarm
It was not in the hands of crofters
It was threatened also to take the crofters land from them but it did not come to that
Auchiltibuie I think and a large tract of the Coigach district
I am not sure but there was a large tract of the Coigach district
I think it was behind Auchiltibuie between Baden Tarbat and Auchiltibuie
Yes  as it is too well populated
I dont say it is that if the poor people would be allowed to scatter here and there into the glens and get the land they were dispossessed of back again
Yes the extent of the parish is forty miles by forty miles and that is a great deal of pasture
No with the number there is in the village of Ullapool following the fishing
There are about  souls here alone on the property of Lady Matheson
No and that will work by itself if you have proper rules upon the estate  it will work by degrees as it did in my own country
You need not force them  they will accommodate themselves
No they would not  they would not be allowed to do it  and I dont think on Lochiels estate I know of any such thing
Never
Yes but it belongs to the rules of such clubfarms that they are not by any means to be subdivided and of course that is enough
I was and I was very reluctant to do it it was a matter of necessity
I was
I did not
I called the attention of the proprietors first and they came forward and then generous friends in the south supplied what the proprietors did not do
Yes and to show that what I advocate is the thing none of our crofters who were in good condition came forward to ask one pound of meal or money
No one got it but the poor people who had no land or only patches of land
The people who had any stock had as much credit as tided them over
I do not and I hope I will never have to do it again  it was very much against my grain to have to do it
No I mean round about the lairds house and down to the riverdown to the sea
I mean the whole strath of Little Lochbroom between what is occupied by the laird himself and the farm of Dundonell as I understand about  acres
No but the other side is a forest entirely
Oh yes it is not made forest it is contiguous to the forest
Yes
Yes and the proprietor has the rest under grass and under sheep
The most of it was in the village of Ullapool
I must say to the honour of the crofters that very few from the country came forward for relief
They would have taken it if they could have got it in large measure but they would not condescend to take two or three stones of meal and they would not get more than that at a time
Those who got any of it were brokendown people in the village and those who had no land and whom we knew thoroughly well to require it
No
Yes from thirty to eight and they cannot get gear for them  they have not the money
They cannot be trusted for it from the bank because they are so poor
Of course the fathers got old and the sons went away because the fishing was not paying and there are various other reasons
It was not and the people were poor and everything combined made them give it up
I think there are eight of them going to the east
Most of them because they must be all decked now
Yes
I suppose it was
Yes
No from the farm when the farm became vacant the proprietor made half of it into the forest
Yes
Not when money is the thing in view
When a man must replenish his purse he must do it
But if it is broken up and given to smaller tenants I believe that might be done
I dont know any land in Lochbroom that could not be broken up for small tenants
Yes but I have shown that the low ground will never pay the crofters they must have a large outrun
Yes
Yes
To be sure I would and where I would have sheep the deer would be allowed to go
The deer were wilder formerly than they are now and it was better sport for it cannot be called sport now
It was better sport when the deer were in the corries and far off wild places
They are now like sheep and you can kill them with a stick if you like
Yes
No I have nothing to add
Of course there arc some here who could take small farms of from  to  of rent
I know there are great difficulties but something must be done
I have just given my opinion
I dont go into ethereal remedies
Let the whole of Auchiltibuie be turned into a club farm up Strathkennar
I know some people object to that and the reason of it is that there are two or three big fellows who object and keep up with the factors and say  No down with it and the factors keep a deaf ear and a shut eye to all the clamour of the poorer people
Let club farms be the ride and not the exception and you will see that they will renew and reform things in the Highlands without going into the difficulties of peasant proprietory
I want practical things which I have seen carried out and nothing else
Yes
I dont know
Yes
No
It is the land upon the other side of us that was taken from us
It is of both kinds it is suitable part of it for arable cultivation and some for pasture land
Some of it is better
I cannot tell very well until it was brought under cultivation
A farmer has it
He is a tenant a man of the country name Donald MLeod and we march with Baden Tarbet on the other side
Probably he pays about  but I dont know the exact figure
Yes that is the only one upon that side
Yes that may be the case but our chief grievance is that the wintering has been taken from us the islands
I am not able to say much about it  it is chiefly pastoral and perhaps for an increase of food to the people it would not be of much service although we got it
Baden Tarbet farm
It is a pretty large farm
I used to know the rent but I dont know it now
Yes
I really could not give an opinion upon that
The great loss arising from our being deprived of the islands is this that we have nothing now to winter our cattle whereas formerly cattle could winter themselves upon the islands the islands lie low and the cattle could eat seaware and grass and heather
They are not given to the same man  they are held by different people
They are distributed between three or four tenants but nobody lives on them they always belonged to our place formerly
It is some twenty or thirty years since we lost some of them
Yes it would be exceedingly suitable to add them
No it is not very long since the present factor came to the place
All these changes were made before his time
Seven or eight years
It is at Baden Tarbat in the centre of the country and not in our own particular part of it at all
The anchorage would suit it is a quay we require
It would suit by far the greater number of them but perhaps it would not be very convenient for the whole of them
Yes
Yes
Yes
No nothing except that we complain of the small holdings and the large rents and it has been that way since MLeod lotted out the land and fixed the rent
We have been deprived of our peat ground which is getting exhausted and we have to go a long way for the peats now
Yes and long before it
No nothing at that time
It was made into a farm which is now occupied by a gentleman of the name of Lindsay
It was added to an existing tack
They wanted the fence drawn transversely through the land diagonally down to the sea so as to leave the good portion of their own township with them
Yes it was twice better than what was left to us one yard was better than two of what was left
I understand the rent was increased
Yes each of us pays s d there is plenty of seaweed on the shore
Yes there would have been quite enough and to spare even although he were to use three times the amount he uses
There is a long seacoast
Very few have built new houses
They are pretty badpretty old  just about as bad as they can be and still remain habitable
I believe they might but it would not be worth while to build houses upon the small portions of land we have or to improve them in any way
The ground is poor and the crofts small and they cannot keep us alive
I am not going to say much about that there are a few horses but the place cannot keep them
Yes those who have horses pay a pound additional
There are only two horses set apart for the township and the men who have them pay a pound each
We wish first of all that we would get that piece of good ground between us and the sea which was taken from us  and at any rate if we cannot get that we would wish that the small patches that have been left to us would be given us at a somewhat more reasonable rent
A larger holding is of all things what we want
We used to pay our rent by our stock and now we cannot keep stock
I put a third of what I have under rye grass and a third under turnips and a third under oats and one cow would eat the whole thing the place is so very small a cow and a calf could eat it
Yes the neighbours use the horses for ploughing in some places in return for payment but the great portion of the arable ground is of such a kind that horses cannot work it
Yes for every bit of it if they were kept going but those who have the horses sometimes go to earn wages to other townships to plough so that the horses are not always available
Well perhaps they prefer to go far afield and get better paid
They will be paid more exactly there than at home
My ancestors have been for at least  years upon that country side between Inverlaul and Auchinahaird and Rhidorrach
They were foresters for some  years probably father and son and then they went over to the other side
My people are the oldest in the place
I have heard often enough of MLeod of Coigach
Yes often
My people were here before the Union when James was king before the Georges came to the land
Yes
About a dozen of them
The people are not at home just now they are away but they left their mandate with us
About twenty who pay rent
Four
Yes probably about one hundred
What I as an old man have to complain of chiefly is that the rent has been increased and this in consequence of our own improvements upon the land
Our township paid a rent of  and for the last three years we have been paying  Now I am an old man and I have no familythey have taken wing and flown away they were not of such a kind as would remain in the place
I kept a horse before the rent was raised and they made me pay for the horse separately from the rent
Now they have combined the rent of the horse with the rent of the land
I pay now   for the grazing of a horse in another place in Assynt at Knockan and the factor here compels me to pay  on the croft
The place is contracted and is not suitable for grazing a horse in summer

The  includes the horse  and there are the rates in addition
Nearly fifty years
 s
Yes but it is a bad place it is rocky and stony ground and I expended a great deal of labour upon it blasting the rocks
Yes
Yes the man that improves best will have his rent increased most
Only our own factors
Yes quite I did not happen to be at home at the time I was at Caithness fishing when the valuation was made
They would be none the worse of being better
Yes it was myself that erected them and kept them up afterwards I paid for the masons and took some of the timber from Wick and from Inverness and Loch Hourn
Not a penny
So far as I am aware their condition in that respect is the ame I am not aware that they ever asked any assistance
Nothing whatever I would not even get an ounce of powder to blast the rocks
I did not ask the pasture but what I asked I did not get
There is no occasion to tell
They must needs be
But if they are able to have a cow they will have a cow and if they can afford to buy a sheep they will have a sheep and they need potato ground and other conveniences
I am not aware
Yes
They make their livelihood someway
The whole of their livelihood is not by any means dependent on us if that were the case they would be hungry indeed
There are other tenants coming in between us and the large farm of Baden Tarbet
Yes that would be necessary but I am not sure that they would be willing to emigrate
The younger ones have to support their parents
They would be exceedingly glad to go there that is suitable land for rearing people and not ours
Our land is rock and moss
No that is the reason why they ask for assistance to enable them to take their livelihood out of the sea
It is a bad harbour in winter
The southwest wind
No
To be sure
It could be done very well at considerable expense
There are plenty of stones
Yes there is a sort of quay
That would depend upon the amount of labour which would be expended upon it
Almost all of them have
Yes there are some  one that I had myself is still there and there is another one
In Wick

Yes
By the sea not by the land
They would try whatever
I am not sure
The land is for the old people and the sea for the young men
They would be the better of that
Surely
Not by any means
The wind swept away the crops and the storm destroyed the potatoes
Yes as my family left me that is the reason of it and my strength ebbed away
Some of them died and the females married
No it is by the horse I am taking home the peats I am not able to carry any burden
No
It is by the stock and by the credit this year
I got  or  for a good beast
This year   if it is a good beast
Yes
Indeed I have not many sheep
I know fine
Between five and ten
Yes I sold three this year
 for the three
Just that
 sold the wool with them
Yes
Yes a good many
Very rarely now
The young people will get good clothes
They are
Very few
I think not
I dont know that
Indeed yes
I know some of the children that were kept from school last examination for a fortnight for want of clothes
Yes quite well
Yes very much better
We had a kind of potatoes then that I dont see now at all
The people at that time lived more upon potatoes than they do now even supposing they had potatoes now they would not consider it good diet
Yes when I first remember
Usually till seed time but they give the potatoes away to the cattle more now
I am not a delegate and have nothing to say only I would like to state three or four points about the tenants
I have very little to say on their behalf
The land we have is rented by us but these other tenants that spoke get the use of it
Their own land would not pasture their stock and when the proprietor gave the place to us he was for putting up a fence between us and them and we would not allow him because we knew that in that event the stock of these people would starve all their pasture would not feed twelve head of cattle altogether
We are quite willing to remove our own stock off the place for their benefit and we told to the proprietor a year or two ago adding that that was more his business than ours but that we would require to get a reduction of rent and we did not get any hearing for that
I wish to speak a few words on behalf of the people generally if I may be allowed
Although the poor people would get all they want although they should get a reduction of rent and enlarged holdings these benefits would be of no service to them unless there were proper estate regulations going along with it to prevent the one crofter from injuring his neighbour
It may so happen that one is in good circumstances and may have a great amount of stock and pay only  or   of rent while his neighbour might pay  of rent and have little or no stock at all
The whole parish
The man that has this large stock usually has a very large family and when the sons marry the stock is split up and separated and scattered
Then another mischief is that some of them keep no less than six dogs
We have sold the whole of our stock because of the number of dogs round about us belonging to the people of the place
What I should like would be that there should be something like a clubfarm so that the one who would only pay   of rent should have only his share the same as the one who paid a larger rent and that the stock should be placed under proper management and supervision so that the poor man although on a bed of sickness should not suffer more than the man who was better off
We are sometimes blaming proprietors but this must be said that some of the people among ourselves if they had the power would probably use it against their neighbours at least quite as oppressively
Many of the landed proprietors probably dont use their power to the utmost
No doubt the people have cause to complain and they have that all over the  country but what I want to speak about would be some practical measure for their good
The people would benefit by many other things besides an increase of the holdings of land
We are in want of a quay and we get no assistance whatever in order to build one even supposing our boats should be broken and injured
I should like that the people should get increased holdings and I dont see why they should not there is plenty of land and to spare but still I would like if these other things could come in at the same time and along with that
But if any one thinks that we my brother and myself have too much land we will be very glad to share it with our poorer neighbours and we have always been so
It was given to my father and another man forty years ago
We got Lots of Scoraig along with Scoraig
That is Lots
It was a part of Scoraig when we came to Scoraig we got it along with Scoraig although it is called Lots now
It was given to my father and another man and then Lots was cut off Scoraig and twenty lots made of it
My brother and I have the half of Scoraig and there are two families on the other half
Yes for so many days labour
Yes
Yes
There are better judges of that here than I
My judgment is that they are paying too much rent
as they were improving the land and making it better
It is worth now more than  surely when they improved it
Well I dont know about the same rent but I dont think it should be put at such a high figure as it is now
I dont see that any other thing is advancing and I dont understand why rent should advance
I think there is too much put on
No but that would be just as people would say it would be just and right to do it
I dont concede that point
That is my opinion whatever
Although I would mention a price for the lot just now it would not be accepted
If I would be put out as judge for the place I would give an opinion but I am not fit just now
No
The most of them came from Dundonnellwe came from that part ourselvesand from Kildonan and part from Rereoch
Kildonan is part of a farm now  it is just on a right line over from the Ferry
Yes
It was a little
When this  was taken for Scoraig I think we had it for two years or so and then the rent was raised
The notice was that we would require to pay double but when my father went to pay the rent I think we got it for twothirds and it is at that rent yetIf anything was done it is not since our new proprietor came in
I heard part of John Mlver
They are wanting labour besides that
Yes from all the tenants
They are wanting six days of the men and four or five days of those that will be at home just now to cut peats and corn and everything of the kind
Yes one must do it as well as the rest
That is for the croft we have in Scoraig
Since these new people came from Australia the people are getting their dinner sometimes
No
I never heard them complain
For my part I may say it is themselves that have it  it is theirs as well as mine
That is true
Yes I think nothing will be of use unless there are good regulations to make the tether for the merchant as well as for other men as short as it can be done
If it would come down from the Government that a board would be erected in every parish to look after these things as well as the Parochial Board
Yes
No I am sure a proprietor would have no objections to a board of this kindno right proprietor
It would benefit his own tenants and he would get the rent
I think he would get the rent and he would get just all the kindness of the people
I think so
Well according as the place is just now if I am able to put stock on the land I may put  or  sheep there
Is that justice for the poor man who cannot buy one cow
They are and they are poorer this year
I never saw them so poor
But I am hearing there are some gentlemen in this parish saying they are not
My books show a different story
Yes
In the first place when the township of Lots was formed in  there twenty men put down having a lot each
The first formation on the Black Moor the rental for the twenty lots was 
 for the wholes for each that was the case for the first nine years or rather instead of s it was six days labour
There was no rent paid in money it was six days labour equal to s
In nine years the rent and labour was put up to twenty days and it continued at that till
There was no money value put on it then merely twenty days labour
They were supposed to give the twenty days labour for the rent
They gave the labour at that time
Yes
In  there was money rental imposed varying from  s d to  s per lot which they considered a very hard case indeed
Instead of raising the rents the people ought to have got compensation for their improvements
They have no communication by road only by a dangerous rocky mountain which is a hazardous way of travelling even in daylight and there is no pier to land at with boats
The people wish if it can be got through the Royal Commissioners to have a road there which would benefit upwards of sixty families beginning at Scoraig right through the townships of Lots Carnoch Pereoch Achmore and Badraloch and joining the ferry of Dundonnell on  the top of the hill at Mulbuie
They also want more pasture security of tenure and reduction of rent
Although I am not an old man I have never seen anything done there by the proprietors to benefit the people although they have been oppressed
Yes
A money rental
Paid in labour
None whatever
Not on these terms
They were put there to make the best of it and told they would never be put out unless for a crime
No
I think my father can speak to it
Yes he says he was
The terms that were given were that we were to have it for nine years for nine days work
Then when these nine years were over twenty days labour was imposed on us
There was no promise except that so long as we would not be charged with any crime we would always remain therethe nine days service was to last for nine years
We did not know about that
We did not know anything that the proprietor might choose to impose
They did not oppose i t  they just accepted the terms and worked the twenty days
We never gave money
Yes a substitute would be accepted
They would require the services of a man
We just paid the rent
We did not protest against it but the reason of the new arrangement was that we were not able to attend upon the day to give the work which the proprietor wanted we were engaged in other employment
We were ready to do it upon a subsequent day but meanwhile the proprietor got rather irritated and said he would not be bothered with conduct like that and he imposed a money rent
No he gave us no assistance
  A voluntary declaration has since been made by this witness to the effect that his answer to question  is not in accordance with facts
See Appendix A No
LXXI
I dont know many that got wood
I am not aware
I am not aware

There were twenty families went there originally and there are twenty yet
We got  worth of black stony ground which was brought under cultivation at the beginning among the whole twenty families of us
I have myself perhaps a little over two acres some have less and others have about that
One head of cattle was put down in my summing when I got the place
I keep two head of cattle
I have no horse nor sheep
Two milk cows
Well if I have it is not upon the croft
The croft cannot keep the two cows either
How could it do so when all the pasture we have is just the breadth of the arable ground back on the hill
No
If the neighbouring places would preserve the marches strictly the whole twenty of us could not keep ten beasts upon our own pasture
The breadth of the arable land behind
It goes back the same breadth it forms a square
Two head of cattle
The rent of the whole township is  my rent is about    and others pay more and some less
They will by what grows upon them for winter keep
Yes exclusive of taxes

Yes
Yes the township when we went there was given for  taking off Scoraig
There was no agreement to that effect
It is worth more than when they got it
It is the additional amount and the want of pasture for the cattle
They have no place to put cattle behind the dykes except about fifty yards
Certainly if they got pasture
The township of Lots not Scoraig
Lots was taken off Scoraig it has been distinctly apart from Scoraig since
I dont know
I have reason to believe there are but I cannot speak on that point
I dont think they value it so much in the conditions of lease
You would not get an ablebodied man to work days labour under s a week and provide everything himself
Yes certainly and often they have to waste six weeks in making out twenty days owing to the bad weather
I live at Advie on Spey
Dundonnell
I have been brought up on it and my father is still living there
Yes
I have no idea of the acreage
A good part
It is a good many yearsbut not into a forest proper for letting until twelve years ago
I cannot tell
There are none
It was all under the name of Dundonnell
There was no tenant in that forest
A Mr Urquhart
I cannot tell
Not for the forest
No
One forest
Not very well
Yes
It is in the parish of Loch Broom
Yes
I cannot say but to all appearance there were in old times
Yes
I am not aware but it is so yet
I cannot tell
I have passed through it
Yes it has
I have passed through it but have not much acquaintance with it
I was not aware
It is  odds
Yes heather and stones
Not that I am aware of
Yes
Most certainly
Yes we want a road
I dont know whether they pay actual road money
They think themselves they do but I am not  aware of it
No reason whatever
To a distinct tenant and not resident
Fairish a man paying about  rent it is merely pasture for him
He keeps cattle and sheep and horses on it
They ought to get the breadth of the lots until it strikes the sea on the north side and a reduction on the present rental that is the only thing they could get for pasture directly behind their township
It would be the highestrented piece of ground on the whole property although they had all that
Four
No it is on a different side of the Loch
Mr Mlver Scoraig
A mile and a half
It adjoins on the pasture
The rents of the small tenants are paid at the term of Martinmas for the year from the Whitsunday preceding to the Whitsunday following but the crop of the following year is the crop for which that rent is paid
The tenant goes away at Whitsunday and the crop has to be reaped off the lot
The tenant who comes in generally gets that and the incoming tenant pays the arrears which is really the debt of the outgoing tenant
The man who goes in
No he pays the rent
Yes
A years rent is sometimes charged but the years rent gives him the right to crop the lot that year
Yes but it is paying the debt of the man who is going away
It is not paid to the Duke it is paid to account of that tenant
He does
I cannot condescend upon any particulars regarding it
I cannot tax my memories whether two rents or one rent was paid but I am certain that one years rent is sometimes paid
But it is very rare
I dont at this moment
I would not say it is impossible
I cannot say
Previous to the valuation which was made of the small crofts in this district when the tenant died a small sum was sometimes added in the case of a son succeeding the father but never in the case of a widow succeeding her husband but since the valuation of the lands was made the additional rent fixed by these valuators was charged
It appears to me that there is a misapprehension in the minds of the people who have spoken on that subject
They have so many misunderstandings that I am not at all surprised at it they have so many misunderstandings as to what is done by the landlords agent
That I thought they always understood
I think that is a most absurd complaint
The number of bag nets is small over an immense stretch of coast
They are only about  yards out from the seashore and if the people go beyond that as they generally do the nets should be no hindrance
The nets are fixed to the land at one end and the other end is secured by two anchors so that they never move
If the people go with their lines close to these nets it is possible they may come in contact with ropes and nets
But the bag nets are not more than  yards from the shore
No I never heard of a complaint until this day
I am sure they dont
They have no business to interfere with them
Yes or by people setting their lines too close to the bag nets
A great many of the statements made today were perfectly new to me I never heard of them before and did not know such complaints could be made
The complaints I heard made were in connection with the improvement of the farm of Clashmore
Clashmore was a township with a lot of small tenants in it
They cultivated the lots very partially and the Duke of Sutherland one day standing on the hill pasture asked me would it not be a good thing for the employment of the people if we were to set agoing a small farm here on which we could show the people what crops could be grown by proper trenching and drainage and farming on the regular rotation
I said I thought it would be a good thing indeed and would give a great deal of employment to the people of this place Clashmore was fixed upon as suitable for the purpose
In carrying out this improvement it was necessary to remove some of these tenants but the Duke laid out a considerable sum of money in improving land to give lots to these people who were so removed
I think I can
I think it is in my memorandum which I have from the books of the office
In  and following years to  the farm of Clashmore was improved and created purposely to give employment to the people of the Stoer district around in draining trenching fencing roads and making culverts and dykes
There was spent from the beginning to the end  s d in making that land
The houses including offices mill and farmers house upon the farm cost in addition  s d
No that was separate
There was spent between  and  in improving the crofts for these tenants and they got  in money and materials for the purpose of assisting them to build new houses
To Mr Brown the tenant of the hotel here
There was no arable land hereabout and he required it for the purpose of providing hay and oats for his establishment
About ten miles
It is his servant who occupies the house but he occupies the farm
The Duke decided it otherwise  that it should be given to the tenant of the inn
It is quite true that he got the slates
What the exact amount was I cannot tell but this I know that they are not paid for yet
They are partly paid and partly not paid and there is a considerable balance due
It was given many years ago on the understanding that it was to be paid at the end of one two and three years
Well he has not been troubled in the least about it
I am not conscious or aware of any cases of severity towards widows
I have no recollection of anything of the kind
It was necessary to move them in making this farm and the farm was dyked and a certain number of parks made in it and these people lived upon the ground and it was necessary to remove them to their new places
I am not conscious that in doing so there was ever any severity used towards them
If it was it was without my knowledge and personally I never heard a complaint about it
There is at this moment work going on in the neighbourhood of that mans place
There is a path three miles long going on within the forest of Glencanesp and the contractors complained to me that they had great difficulty in getting men to work
Murdoch Kerr who made the complaint of no work is a road contractor and has fourteen miles of road under contract to keep it in repair which keeps him constantly going
There is not much work going on at present from the Duke of Sutherland
None for many years until last year the forest of Glencanesp
Mr John Scobie was tenant of it as a sheep farm but on succeeding to Keoldale on the death of General Scobie he gave up his farm and went to Keoldale
The Duke did not think it right that one man should have both and this farm was left upon the Dukes hands
It is a very difficult thing to get a sheep farm off his hands and he converted it into a deer forest
Not for ten years
There was an addition made to the Reay forest about twelve years ago
None else
A part of it did well but it was a very bad spot and most difficult to improveso difficult that it cost  an acre to improve it
Yes taking the improvements
No I think it was a very bad speculation
I think whenever land costs more than  to improve it in a bare country with a bad climate it is too much
There were very fair crops but it was limed and drained and trenched and everything done to make it a good farm but a great part of it was a very poor subject
Yes better but that is not to be wondered at
The subject was not good and although a lot of money was spent upon it it was not a good speculation
Yes it was drained but not limed
No the small tenants here dont lime their land
The Duke of Sutherland had the farm in his own hands that year and received nothing for it It was entered in the valuation roll for  and he paid both as a landlord and as a tenant for it
The former rent had been 
We could not get 
If a good tenant had offered we would have been very much disposed to do so I think
No
Just 
It was unfortunate for the Duke but it was fortunate for the people who were employed to make it
Perhaps it was not
That is so
There was a loss to the Duke and to the parish because the rent could not be obtained for it
Because we thought that was the rent we should have taken if we could have got a good tenant for it
It is given to a gentleman upon very easy terms
We have not begun to do anything
The farm house remains as it was
Lord Cloncurry has taken it for this season and is paying a small rent for it
He is living in the hotel and he has taken the forest on the understanding that if it pleases him he is to keep it at a particular rent
There will be two large farms out in this district next Whitsunday and it is not yet decided how they are to be disposed of
The Duke has it under consideration and it has been a matter of correspondence between him and me that we should endeavour to supply the loss which Mr Williamson explained todaythat we should try to have some middle class farms or such farms as it would be an object for the crofter to look forward to obtaining
Such fences are very common and is the kind of fence that is now erected
It is not intended to be a deer fence
I may mention that the pasture of the tenants of Inverkirkaig and Strathan adjoining the forest of Glencanesp was rather limited and they petitioned the Duke to give them that portion of the low ground of Glencanesp to increase it and the Duke has kindly complied with their request and added  acres to their pasture
They are to pay   additional rent for these  acres and this fence which is referred to is erected between the forest and the new portion of the ground they have received
I really dont know I have never seen the fence myself
The Duke has put up the fence at his own expense
That is a mistakea great exaggerationit was only  acres in extent before the  acres were taken off
I measured it carefully and came to the conclusion that its contents were  acres and now when the  acres have been taken off it will only be  acres
I should think  or  acres
No part of the parish of Eddrachillis
No this was the first and only forest made
As near as I can say the Reay forest contains  acres that is the only other one there is
It is in the parishes of Durness Eddrachillis and Lairg
The whole of that ground was under sheep up to  when a portion of it was forested
There was no part of it forest originally but it was called the Reay forest because Lord Reay shot deer over that portion of his estates
In the days of the last Lord Reay there was but it is not so long since sheep were introduced into this country I think it would be about the beginning of the century
I have endeavour to ascertain what the tradition of the country on that subject was as I had no other means of arriving at the truth and the information which I got from old people was that previous to  there were about twelve crofters living on what is now called Reay forest
They lived down in the low parts of the forest and had cattle and horses
In the summer they went to shielings up on the hills but Lord Reay had the hills for sport
Very fine and it was very extensive much more so than it is now
The hills were of no value in those days and he shot over the whole of them
Each station will have about six bag nets
From Cape Wrath to Lochinver five or six stations
They are all along the coast near the sheep farmers and the crofters
Any quantity the complaint about that is a most frivolous one in my opinion
There may possibly have been a net at Auchmelvich
It should not have been
Yes these clearances were carried out by Mr Anderson Rispond
That I also wash my hands of personally it was done about the time I was born
Yes it has belonged to them for nearly two hundred years
I stated yesterday that in the year  the Duke of Sutherland had made very large abatements of arrears of rents to small tenants to the amount of some  and I think it proper here to state that although s d was due by the small tenants of Assynt and was wiped out altogether and never again asked for in my own time since I became factor in cases of poverty and distress where the people really were poor and I thought deserving I myself have abated  to the people of this district
I wiped out arrears to that amount
It was asked today why the rents of the small tenants were not reduced and I wish to state that fact
I think I can explain why they were not given
Since I came to this district the rents of the small tenants have increased comparatively little whereas the rents of the large grazing farms have increased from  s d in  when I entered on the factorship to  s d in  in other words the rental of the large farms was more than doubled between  and  throughout the district
The rental of these large farms in  was  s d in   s d in   s in   s d
Yes when a farm was vacant it was advertised
Yes but since  the rents have been reduced by about 
Yes but he has not required to pay that it has come down to  a year
A great loss
I cannot say that  agree with the opinions expressed here today as to the fitness of much of the land in this parish for crofters
The arable land is very limited and the climate is very bad
It might do for sheep farming but certainly not for cropping
It certainly has frightened me and the Duke of Sutherland has been frightened by larger improvements
The stock on Clashmore farm if given to the crofters would be valued as the prices of sheep go at something like  and the stock of Ardvar would be  at the present price of sheep that is  for stock of these two farms which some people perhaps would give for these two farms
Not so much but a person taking these two farms might lose from  to 
Any person who took it would require to keep a portion
It would require a little consideration thatten or fifteen per cent
No doubt it would depend on the amount of valuation
There is always an additional sum put upon a sheep stock in consequence of its being fitted for the land on which it is reared
A person who comes in pays the value of the sheep and the value of them as belonging to the farm
Strange sheep wont do on a farm sheep reared on it are a necessity for it
I dare say the valuers would be inclined to put as much as possible upon the landlord
We had no complaint of the valuation of Glencanesp and the day it was gone over I would have been glad to give  over to any person who would have taken the stock
But we got out and lost nothing sheep rose
It was stated here today that two tenants were taken in at Auchmelvich and there was no reduction of rent made
I have a distinct recollection of taking in a shepherd or herd whom the tenants had introduced upon the farm and quarreled with
They left him in his croft and made him pay rent and I insisted he should be put on the Dukes rental and I deducted that rent from every other tenant in Auchmelvicha certain proportion of it
One delegate yesterday mentioned that he had never got any work from the Duke of Sutherland
Now I think it my duty after being thirtyeight years in the service of the Duke of Sutherland to express in the highest terms the kindness and the liberality with which the tenants have been treated in my opinion by the Duke of Sutherland
I have served both father and son
This year when it was stated that seed was required I happened to have occasion to go to London and I went to the Duke of Sutherland and told him seed was required and he asked me how much money would be required and I told him the amount I thought would be required and in the most generous kind manner he granted it at once
A certain amount of seed was given to every man on the estate in the district of the three parishes who wished for it on the understanding that it is to be paid at Martinmas with the rent
We expect it will be wholly paid
Yes it is given on those terms
There were several things said here today regarding myself but I dont think they are worth notice
No I did not include the liming in that
No  would not in such a poor climate and with such an inferior soil
I think there is very little land in this district worth more than s an acre
Yes
It is so
In parts of the country where there are no stones and where there is not much drainage required
On the east coast of ScotlandMorayshire and Nairnthey improve the land without drainage they just put on the oxen and plough it up and there it is done for a small amount and in the climate it pays very well
A number of tenants took in a great quantity of land in that district in that manner at their own expense having a lease of  years
No there is no place where that can be done it is such a boggy mossy rocky and stony country none that I know of in this district at all events
Yes
I have often heard that statement made by the humbler classes but I never had any conversation with the better classes on the subject
I know that it is the impression in the mind of a number of the smaller people in the country
Yes that is the feeling
No I am perfectly ignorant on the subject
The story I have always heard about it was that they were in extreme poverty
And that a constant recurrence of the famine led to the clearances but whether that is true or not I dont know
Quite possible
I have just been stating to Professor Mackinnon that there is a feeling and impression in the minds of the humbler classes in Sutherland that of those who went into the army their friends were not so well treated as they expected but I never had any information that I could rely upon
There may be at Dunrobin but I have none
There was
Yes about the th
No and I was very much astonished to hear it
The amount put on altogether was not large
Some of them are the children of the crofters others of them have been placed among us when they were removed from the sheep runs
Yes it marches with a sheep farm
Plenty of it
Yes which is not cultivated now but which was cultivated in old times
It is only detached bits or fields that are arable
It is pasture lands that we want
The amount of arable land in Assynt would not maintain the people
Yes
Yes
He would just pay as much as the factor might choose to impose
We expect it to continue for ever
No
No
The predecessor of the present Duke made a walk from the main road down to the extreme end of the township a mile and threequarters in length
The proprietor paid for the whole of it
I am aware that there were rates paid for that place for the last two years
Yes I am aware it was paying rates
We pay so much per pound of poor rates and the Duke and we between us have to pay poor rates for the place that used to pay poor rates when there were sheep upon it
I cannot say
I cannot say I should not wonder at all if the deer forest did
I could not give an opinion upon the matter
What good can we get out of deer
The sheep are bad enough
They were the cause of the people being expelled from their places but still they are better than deer
The deer
Yes we agree very well
They used to do that but we have a good fence nowa stone dyke which separates the two stocks
There is only about a mile of it but it joins in with a loch about a mile broad which does the rest
We paid the half of if and the Duke the other half or the tenant I dont know which
Stone in some parts and turf in others
We can get no use of the deer whereas if we can afford to purchase a sheep it will at all events provide us with clothes
But for the deer we are not allowed to kill or eat them and they are of no other service
We have not as a matter of fact bought it for some years back it is very dear and we cannot afford to buy it
It is white wool they have
Sometimes we can buy broken fleeces at the time of the shearing and the remnants hanging about the flank
The sheep are herded for on tiling and then there is some work connected with them in the way of smearing and shearing
But the deer require no herd and they can leap the fences and eat our crops
I dont know that any work would be required in that case except some ghirlies perhaps
I know a man in my own place
A man Donald Kerr who is away at the fishing
I do not know
A man John MLeod
He is a labourer in Rossshire now
He built a little bothy of a house
He might have got wood perhaps I am not aware that he got anything else
Nothing
John MLeod could not get it it would have gone to pay a debt which was on the lot
Close to the shore but the depth varies
Codlings and flounders
If we put them out we never get them again owing to the ropes and chains and anchors and bag nets along the shore
Yes
No that is quite true but then they are set in the best fishing places we have got
No we never get salmon upon our small lines but it is one of our greatest complaints that we are not allowed to kill the salmon as we please
I cannot say but to the best of my knowledge it is only an increase of rent
That is my opinion
Yes
Yes
No
It is a strange name in the place
Yes
No they are separate families
My ancestors have been here for seven hundred years the Kerrs to whom I belong
I cannot tell
We would rather not see any in the country
If the sheep run were restored to the crofters why should not the shepherd get his portion of it as well as the others
We dont dislike the men but there is no doubt but they are a burden upon the place when they are thrown in upon us
Yes it is both insult and injury
Have they not both been the destruction of the place to us
Have they not sent us down to the rocks and the shore of the sea
Not now
Yes
JOHN MKENZIE DONALD MCASKILL Inverkirkaig DONALD MUNRO ALEXANDER MFARLANE Strathan
Yes
Two or three miles
Yes
About sixteen in Strathan
I cannot tell
From the heights of their own parish
 s d
Yes
Three cows and a horse twelve sheep
About six acres or a little more perhaps
Not for the family but enough for the cattle
Very bad
No it is better in some
Both
No
More land
It is only deer forest now
Glencanisp forest
Two or three years ago
Yes
No
They can go over it it is only about   feet high
There are not many deer yet
We dont know yet but they would spoil the crops I know
It will do that sufficientlyit is a barbed fence
So as to pierce any beast that would attempt to leap over it that is our belief
There may be a little now and again but far too little for the population of the place
Yes the coast is very good for landing but we thought it would be a greater benefit to the place if the curers would come to it as they go to Stornoway
Almost all
Yes
Very little home fishing is done
There was a boat here the other day that had  cod fish and they could not get them sold
Not a soul
No
There were curers once
No
I think it was because the fish got scarcer and it was not worth the while of the fishermen to prosecute it
A good many years ago but I may mention about twelve years ago especially since it has ceased to be productive
Yes
Yes
No
I get a little work about the place when I can take work and I must just live as I may
No
This is not a place for crofting and one expends a great deal of labour in cultivating it with the spade and caschrom
Yes
There are very few places where the horses could work it
So rocky
The whole place is far more suitable for rearing cattle and a little cultivation
Yes
No
Yes
The same
Some of them have it would not be worth while for them all to keep horses the bit they have is so small
Yes
Not very many
They get bits of the township as we have ourselves and they just do as best they may
They get a little here
They can attend to their work even better than the crofters because they have no land to look after
They must live as they can
No
There is very little work at all
This year for example there is a walk being made through the forest but that is exceptional
Then there is a fence being set up between the deer forest and the crofts and that too is special
The people are away at the south and east coast fishing
Were it not for these two things they might go where they pleased they have nothing else to do
Very few if any
Yes
Not very steady
No
About halfadozen
Plenty
No we carry them on the peoples backs
Both
I have been told that
Yes I am aware of a man who told me he paid it himself and I believe he is in here
I dont pay it myself I am not on the rent roll
I am certain that it has been
It certainly has been a subject of complaint at all events for the last ten or fifteen years
Yes
Assynt generally
My statement is very short and something similar to what has been already said
The general grievance in this parish is insufficiency and badness of land
This state of things was brought about by the Sutherland clearances which Sutherland men would like to forget
But one point to which I should like to draw attention is that in Assynt about the beginning of this century the great majority of young men joined the famous rd on the distinct understanding that their parents would not be removed out of their holdings during their life but when the survivors returned they found that the promise had been broken and that the parents for whose sake they had enlisted had been deprived of their land and were eking out a miserable life on barren spots along the seashore
The general size of holdings in Assynt before the clearances was the keeping of from twenty to thirty black cattle a hundred sheep from forty to fifty goats
They were not poor people they had savings of money forby
Now their holdings are too small for that and their cattle although they are called cows are only miserable beasts
The reform wanted is larger holdings security against evictions and raising of rents inducements to improve and reclaim land and build suitable houses outrun for stock and local harbours to encourage a fishing as distinct from a crofting class
The want of that was the reason of so many people being cottars being a burden on the tenants
This parish
I left it about twentytwo years ago
I have
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
That is it
They were enlisting here before I was born but we have brought the tale down from sire to son
 About
Yes
No I dont think it
There were no clearances of any note before that
Oh yes and a great many in Assynt
I mind of more than  pensioners in my younger days being paid in this parish and now I question if there are two
It was by the commissioners of the then Marchioness of Stafford but she was not resident then
It was the general talk from sire to son since I recollect and I have seen some of the soldiers when they came home going to the stances where their fathers had lived and shedding tears and saying they would go and pull down Dunrobin Castle
I have no assurance that there was an exact statement made by the Marchioness of Stafford
I have no document to testify to that at least not within my reach
It is a general tradition of the country
Yes I mind of the men to whom the promise was made
On that understanding alone and any man who had not a son to go on that understanding was paying   to get a man
No the tenants who wished that their sons should not go paid  My grandfather had only one son and he would not allow him to go away and he paid  They tried to get him enrolled again and he said his man was killed in the army my uncle said he was killed already and if it had not been for that he would have been taken out a second time
He purchased a substitute
The recruiting sergeant got the substitute
No it was not a legal claim they paid it voluntarily when they would not allow their sons away
I shall make my utmost endeavour and I have no doubt it could be got in the county of Sutherland
I do think it would be approved of by the people generally in the country
I have suggested it two or three times since I came to the parish and they were all approving of the scheme and I know from my own experience it would prove very productive and of benefit to the place
He would be a fisherman in this country but would not have a cows grass but there are a great many cottars who have no privilege at all unless they get it from others and I have seen them before this s came in pulling down their houses and the fishermen would be very glad to get the stones of the houses
I think so in a place so far away from conveniences
He would need to have an acre of land
They would need to do their best
The acre I referred to would be for winter provender
He would do better without potato ground it would be far better for him to apply his time to fishing
That takes in the grazing of a cow
I am not able to say
That all lies with the proprietors manager to say
In some places it would be worth double what it would be in other places
Yes it would
I am paying  rent and I have not three yards of spare ground
Yes
Yes
Or we would be threatened to be removed
Yes just that
No
No they are all dead and gone now the old pensioners are dead and gone
If there are two there are no more
There is one Kenneth MLeod
Yes a fine stock
There are people living to this day who can testify to that children of men who were removed
Yes
No
Yes
Yes from Aultnancealgach to Stoer Head
No
In the upper reaches of the parish it was by the merks that the lands were held
Five six seven eight and ten and twelve merks
I think the old merk came from the north the merk Scotch
Down about Clachtoll in these days they were only paying from  to   of rent
But when the sheep system came into vogue that raised the lands d worth to   and shortly after that again when they could not pay that it came down to s a merk and it is still at that I suppose
Yes and there is not another county in Scotland better adapted for small crofting than the county of Sutherland with its enormous ocean wealth and rivers and lakes and its natural harbours its railroads are lying dormant which would give a great return to the house of Sutherland if the land had been cultivated and inhabited as it might and should have been
No for that has been my belief for  years
I think this is the worst system of education that ever came to the Highlands
In my younger days the parish schools would I think prove better
Do as they did in those days get a schoolmaster and pay him themselves
But that would not do now schools are more fashionable than they were then
Yes there is no mistake about it
They could soon make churches
Not today I believe not
But thirtysix years ago when a petition was sent to the Duke of Sutherland there were men in this parish who could have taken up the whole parish had it become vacant
But in  or  three shiploads the flower of the country the most courageous men emigrated to America when they saw the deaf ear the Duke gave them
In  a petition was sent to the commissioner a copy of which I have here
I do
I remember when a man with an ordinarysized family would not buy more than three or four bolls of meal in the season
The land was in better condition then
After forty years of working land loses its virtue greatly
The only way I would propose would be that when Ardvar falls out of lease the Duke should advertise it and on getting a suitable number to take it up at a reasonable price that he should cut it up to the ordinary sizeif he could get men able and willing to take it up
Then when another farm falls out young men at home and abroad would be prepared and would help their friends to do the same
Not saying that anything of the kind was to take place in one or two years but when the farms had fallen out of lease
And if the Duke could not get anybody to take them up he would not be to blame
Yes eagerly
There are three men belonging to Assynt who could launch out the capital the Sutherland family themselves put upon it
I dont say that they are in Scotland but I would get them over the quarters of the globe
Yes of the crofting class
I wont say anything about that I was never a tiller of the soil
Well the rent should be fixed according to the stock it would keep
Not altogether
No and I think it is no pleasure or advantage to a proprietor to have his tenantry too heavily rented
I think the greatest fortune a proprietor ever had was a peaceable and happy tenantry who could pay their rents
Yes perpetual leases and if their land should be required for any other particular purpose give them compensation for their improvements
I would not say that times might change
Great changes have taken place since last century and before another greater changes may take place
Say I was taking a piece of land at s an acre in twenty years a man would say it was worth s
Now that extra s is the tenants property and that of his family because it is the result of their labour and I dont see it is proper and just that that s should go at the end of the twenty years into the proprietors pockets
Compensation should be given for the improvements and the ground should stand at its original rent or if any reaction came on property to make the land more valuable raise it in a small proportion
I know in this country men who have become crippled and have lost their legs and hands improving their fathers lots
In improving land there is great risk that a man who is helping his parents might break his arm or his leg
Yes say every fifty years
Yes
No better out you know that Sir Kenneth by experience
Yes to my cost some time ago
In former days fish were taken out of the loch but things have changed and they are taking herrings and fish now halfway between here and say thirty miles away
It is not a place for fishing now but supposing there was a small village at Stoer or Gairloch Head near a fishing ground it would be very beneficial and curers would come there to buy fish
Yes Ullapool is a very inconvenient place for early fishermen
The Sound of Handa is a suitable place and make the island of Handa a stance for the fishing village
Not today but I have seen the day in some of the townships here when there were twelve houses of cottars over and above the tenants and each of them that paid attention to the fishing was equally if not better off than those who had land because they devoted their whole attention to the fishing
Yes
I think they would get support here and there for that and repay the money again
I think so
I think they could
I think so and I think Stoer Head is a good place
They could lift herring much nearer at Stoer Head than Stornoway but there is no place here for them
A quay that would contain  or  large boats
Yes the people of the place say it is a suitable stance and in the middle of winter they could run out anywhere
It would no doubt
No quay should be built for lass than  boats
It would be a good one I think
It would
Yes but it might give good revenue
The curers all pay for the stances of the boats and pay so much for harbour accommodation as there is no other placethere is no harbour accommodation without paying
But the want of success in this country is owing to the want of the like of that
Yes I am distinctly of opinion according to their conversation that they would be agreeable to that
From my aunts and cousins and uncles
They told me that in bad seasons they perhaps lost twelve or fourteen of their cattle in one winter and that would not injure their stock they just had stock as well as ever
No
Yes and from some living who have seen it
Of course it was not in my day I dont mind of it but there are some alive who do mind of it
I dont think there would be any record of the stock of the people but I dont know
The only means would be just to get the Sutherland books of those times
No they just sold them as they best could
A great many of them took too heavy of their stock to the small holdings and lost the benefit of their stock by that
They did not like to part with their stock those who wished to keep them
Nothing more was known about it
No
Yes sheep alone
No
I cannot exactly say perhaps about  to  if not more
They could tax them and make money of any part of it that they did not require
It would be onehalf
I cannot say but one thing is sure there would have been no difficulty in making money of the sheep and giving it to him of any overplus they did not require because I should say onehalf the stock would have done them with black cattle
Yes that is what they would need to do
I know that
It is the practice of all Highland estates or most of them
Yes
Yes but that would not be a stumblingblock nowadays and even Auchmore farm if it were put down for tenants today and the stock sold at the market I question if the incoming tenant would lose more than  by it
They would sell at high prices
Of course it woidd but nothing but what they could make
A great difficulty
Yes that is what I would propose to sell the stock in the market and it might diminish  or  on the  or  the tenants would be at that loss
There might be a difference between the valuation and the market price to that extent
They would need to expect some loss they would not get everything their own way
Well I am very delicate to say they would get Government money
Yes a namesake of my own
Yes
I question that
I do not know whether they would or not but one thing I would like to see would be the Duke condescending to come to that point to meet the tenants so far that stocking would be the only stumblingblock
I do I am firmly of that opinion and have been for many a year
Yes
In this house
Yes Highlanders are very warm to each other in that way
Very much so
Yes so far in  I asked Grieve in Greenock if he would be inclined to support an inquiry into the conditions under which the landlords got the land off the Crown
Yes and the following year I went to Inverness
Yes
It was sent to the first name on the petition from Mr Mlvers office by the ground officer and William Matheson was the first who came to me as I was the writer of the petition and when Mr Loch regretted that the writer did not put himself in communication with him I wrote another letter giving him my name and address to make any inquiry of me he might wish
Yes the ground officer of the parish went personally to Mathieson with it and Mathieson came to me
Yes
Yes sweet words to please the people of course they would need something to butter them while refusing the request
I cannot point to one case of success regarding crofters that he could make any reference to on this side of the county of Sutherland
Poorer than ever I recollect them to have been
When Mr Mlver came to this estate the inhabitants of this district were worth in courage and means fifty per cent more than they are today
Yes
I cannot say I am twentytwo years out of the place and for the statistics of the county I cannot speak
I suppose it is a fact
No
Yes
No and I remember some who were paid off at d a day but by the influence of some gentlemen who were coming to the fishing here they got their pensions increased before their death
Yes
No not twenty years
Those who were paid off had small pensions and they got paid according to the time but after conversation with those gentlemen who were coming here they got something more
Yes and those who wanted off on certain conditions
Yes of course it is
Yes
Yes increasing the produce of the soil and the resources of the country generally
It was no benefit to the country at all I dont think that for a moment
Today I think they say it was the greatest mistake that ever was committed on the estate
The land has deteriorated in value and wont give the same crop of sheep as it used to do
If this shooting system had not come into vogue these gentlemen would get very little rents for sheep
Yes when not given to small tenants
I think not
In most cases
I think about  years
Yes they bought this parish off an individual whose right to sell it I question
No Lady Mackenzie
That man had nothing to do with the estate
He had only a house and garden from the company who owned Ullapool
No
I have nothing to say
I have told what was to tell already of the townships that are now in the parish
Townships in Assynt cleared for Sheep Farmers
Yes
Don
MDonald Cuileag
Kenneth MKenzie
I have knowledge of the matter and I remember the clearing of some of them
I was in some of them myself but I do not remember the clearing of them all
I have seen the onehalf of them at least I believe and I have got the information about the rest from others
About ten miles
Yes I walked the whole way
There are one or two of those places where there are some people yet
Mr Murdoch
Yes out of every one of them
No there are no crofters in any of the places named today
No not one
Yes they were all placed under sheep farms
I would have been about thirteen or fourteen years of age when the townships in that country side were cleared
About fifty years ago
Ardvar was the last township cleared in the parish and that happened fifty years ago
There would have been about eleven families I could not give the exact number
Some of them were sent to Torbreck then they were removed on to Clashmore
He remained as a labourer with the tacksman of Ardvar after that for seven years
No
No
I have gone through the places which I saw peopled and I have also travelled over many of the places which were cleared before my recollection
The very best of places
At that time they were all good for the number of people that were there
They had cattle and horses and sheep
The places were out of the way I cannot say for the soil but the inhabitants had cattle sheep and horses
The places were not by any means good in most cases to which they were sent some were sent to America some to Rossshire some to the rocks upon the seashore
I do not remember
Yes he was in comfortable circumstances he had cattle and sheep
Yes my grandfather was in Ardvar
Yes a few
They are earning wages in the place they have not scattered abroad
It is with sorrow that I look upon my circumstances henceforward
They can do very little as yet beyond supporting themselves
It is from age  they are but young yet although I am an old man
I have only two daughters
I was appointed for that purpose
A considerable number
What we have to say is that we feel a scarcity of land and that we have no elbow room
We have no room for cattle or even to take crops off the bits that we have
No
Balacladich
I was in Clashmore when it was cleared
It was out of a croft in Clashmore that I went away to where I am now I was removed to that place
About eighteen families were removed off the farm which has been made since
Thirteen of these paid rent five or six were not paying rent
They were all sent out of the place but three
There were only four who left the place
One went to America
The rest were disposed of by crowding them in corners of the place near about upon others
Some new pasture in the place itself was taken in and occupied by them I have some of that pasture land myself and I would be batter without it it has been a source of expense to me ever since I got it
Mr Brown the innkeeper of Lochinver
It was in the occupancy of the Duke
Four or five years
He cultivated it for four or five years
I could not speak exactly to the year it was at least three years
Every one of them
They required it all but they are worse off since
The only reason given was that the land was to be made into an arable farm
Yes and to be at great expense before I got possession of it and loss connected with it
It was not very good
I got  for the expenses of removal and for building the new house but  would not cover my outlay in that matter
All those that were removed got from  to   in order to cover the expenses of removing and building their dwellings
Three of them had slated houses and these got 
I paid first 
I am paying now  s
I was paying  s until these two years back when it was seen that the soil was bad and   was taken off the rent
I pay now  s but it is not worth 
I may say I do not keep stock upon it at all
I keep two cows but not on the income of the lot
I am obliged to buy summer and winter
I have just a share of the hill ground of the place but it cannot pasture a milk cow
Yes a piece of it was taken away
Yes
I have not been in arrears yet any way whatever may befall
I dont think there is much arrears in the place
No there was no abatement beyond the   of reduction I stated before
There were three new lots made upon the bad ground at the back of the township
One of the tenants fell back in circumstances and could not keep up his lot nobody could be got to go into the place and when nobody could be got to take up the croft the three crofts were reduced each by   until they got a tenant for the vacant croft
Yes but nothing was taken off our rent all the same
I could not tell exactly the rent of the township
We knew our own rents well and we did not look much into the rents of our neighbours
Up to   the old lot was worth that rent as compared with the one I have now
It was by the orders of the Duke that it was taken from us
Put it under crop by his own paid servants
Yes they added to the arable land
Twenty acres perhaps
He did not near double it perhaps there are  acres now
Yes
There is no soil and it would not come under profitable cultivation within the lifetime of man
We found it a great mistake anyhow
Probably it was
I got a roof and lime
No I paid   for a thousand slates which I put upon it
The slates cost  s here at Lochinver and cartage of  miles besides
Since Whitsunday
I was regularly educated for it
I was educated for it in Lanarkshire and Dumfriesshire
I was sent to these counties to be taught farming
I am a native of the island of Lewis where my father had a large farm and an extensive business as fishcurer and merchant
I have had to do with crofters from my younger days
I was I could speak Gaelic before I could speak English
I have been present the whole day
I have
The first thing I have to state is with regard to the changes at Laid and Sangobeg
These changes were carried out by Mr James Anderson tenant of Rispond Lord Reays factor
Mr Anderson held a lease of Laid and Sangobeg when the Duke of Sutherland purchased the property from Lord Reay and the Duke had no power to interfere
These changes were not made by the Sutherland family
The next subject I would allude to is the grazing of horses by the tenants of Durness and Foinaven which was mentioned as a complaint or grievance
The people had the privilege of grazing their horses on this ground which was surrounded by the large farms of Eriboll and Baluaskail and the Reay forest and great complaints were made that there was no proper herd and that the horses trespassed very much upon those grounds
I was asked by the late Duke of Sutherland and his commissioner Mr James Loch to go and see the ground and report upon it and after a good deal of consideration it was settled that the generation of tenants then existing should always have right to send their horses to this ground but that as each died their successors should not have the right because there were so many complaints made of the trespassing of the horses
This went on for a number of years until the number of tenants who were entitled to send horses there became very small and then they found the herding became very expensive
Then the people met and without any intimation whatever to the proprietor the whole of them sent their horses up to the grazing
It was then found necessary to have the subject gone into and the Duke of Sutherland and his commissioner came up to Durness and it was settled that the people should continue to send their horses there but that they would require to pay five shillings a year the Duke of Sutherland to pay a herd for them
The person they sent as a herd got Is d but the sum was so small that only a very inferior herd could be got and the horses were not properly looked after
The Duke now has a party placed there to look after the horses and take care of them
It extends over a great many miles and the expense would have been very large
Five or six miles perhaps
That is the explanation about the grazing of the horses at Foinaven
I dont think it is necessary for me to take any notice of what Mr Ross said about the appointment of the School Board at Durness because the whole thing arose thus
The returning officer was not there and he sent me the return and asked me to make it
I brought the return to the meeting and we sat down for the purpose of constituting the Board
Mr Ross got up and said we must first appoint a chairman
I said we must first constitute the Board and then appoint a chairman
I have since asked Mr Ross to come back to the Board but he would not
With regard to Balnaskail farm an excambion was entered into and was gone into in the most regular and orderly manner
A part of the land which the small tenants had was added to Balnaskail and they got a part which the farmer of Balnaskail had
A portion of the farm of Balnaskail was given back to the tenants and a portion of the tenants ground given to Balnaskail
That was before I came to the country forty or fifty years ago
As to the island of Handa it is opposite Scourie and was occupied by ten tenants
When the potato disease occurred in  these tenants came to me in a body and begged I would ask the Duke of Sutherland to send them to America as they could not remain on Handa
They said they saw no prospect of their being able to live in consequence of the failure of the potatoes
I conveyed their wish to the Duke and he complied and sent them to America
There were two families who afterwards said they would not go
One of these was provided with a lot on Achresgil and I dont remember what became of the other
It was opposite my farm and no person could get to it without going through my farm and the Duke said if that was the case it must be added to my farm if I would take it
I accordingly took it and I pay the same rent as the tenants
With regard to Auchligliness Alexander Ross who spoke to that never was a tenant on this estate
His father was a tenant and lived in the village of Scourie where he had built a house
The factor who was here about  or  wished to remove the ground officer who lived on Auchligliness up to Scourie and he gave the lot occupied by the ground officer at Auchligliness to Rosss father
The officer went to Auchligliness but this man Ross remained in the house at Scourie
He got possession and would not go out until he was put out by authority of the Sheriff
Then he went and lived with his family at Auchligliuess
There was a part of the farm of Scirba which this man thought the people of Auchligliness should get but it was let with the farm
This man however would go with horses cattle and sheep and in spite of all remonstrance would put them to this ground
This went on for several years and ultimately I received instructions to say that if he would not comply with the rules of the estate they would be removed and we were obliged to carry out the threat against our will
She was the tenant she came to me at Scourie and promised faithfully they would go off properly and legally and I agreed that they were to be left but that understanding was not carried out
The consequence was that we were obliged not to permit such an illegality to go on in the district
Yes I think it was agreed that she should remain in one end of the house and the new tenant would go into the house with her
Yes
She was the tenant he was not but it was with her authority that the illegality went onat least it was through her being tenant
With regard to the school at Insheigra of which Mr Finlayson spoke the school was built with the approval of the Board of Education who were informed of the number of the children who would attend the school and what the size of the school was to be
Plans were sent to them and approved of and the school was built according to the rules of the Education Act
I never heard any complaint and I am chairman of the boardas to children not receiving secondary education
There are two apartments in the school
The people Mi Finlayson says complain if the want of a smith
They made that complaint on a previous occasion and we assisted them to put up a little smithy and it was arranged that the smith from Scourie should go down regularly on stated occasions and do work for the people
The smith did so and this arrangement went on for a year or two until at last the smith found he was so illpaid that he gave it up and would not go
There is nothing else that I wish to remark on but I shall be glad to answer any questions
Yes
There were two little townships of Clashfearn and Findlebeg
One of the tenants of these places came saying that he wished to go to America and the other was provided with a lot in this neighbourhood
Both these little townships were added to my farm which surrounded them
There has been an immense number over this district
There were townships beyond there is another township called Findlemore beyond Findlebeg but Findlebeg could not have been added to it
Yes
Most emphatically I deny any imputation of the kind
I forget at this moment I am not quite sure
My son who was with me at that time is abroad now
I think he was elected to the vacancy but I am not quite certain
He was nominated by the board
I quite agree it should have been so but at the time there was some difficulty in getting one to join
I am quite able to state that and if any of them had expressed any strong wish or feeling on the subject it would have been considered and most likely agreed to
But it depends on the other members of the board as well as me
He would decidedly
He has been inspector of poor at Scourie for thirty years
He is a native of Rossshire and was brought up in an agents office in Dingwall
None whatever
Certainly
Certainly
He has frequently complained that there was a good deal of filth and that the houses were not so clean in the neighbourhood as he wished and that he had great difficulty in insisting on getting them put into proper condition
It is the Parochial Board that has the sole charge of the sanitary arrangements of the parish
Mr Chisholm has several times mentioned to me the great difficulty he had in getting any improvements made or reforms brought about iu the sanitary condition of the houses
I would not say he pays strict attention to it for I have sometimes complained that he was not so attentive to it as he ought to be
The ground officers daughter happened to marry the teacher who was teacher long before he married
Of course we had no knowledge that such a connection would be formed
His son acts as inspector of poor and his daughter teaches the female school
All these offices are consolidated if one may say so in one family
No I do not
Yes
I shall be at Lochinver
I have a good many statements I would wish to make but perhaps you would wish to hear them at Lochinver
I wish to explain that this district of which I have charge comprehends the parishes of Assynt Eddrachillis and the greater part of Durness
A portion of Durness is in the Tongue management
Assynt has formed part of the Sutherland estate for nearly two centuries
Eddrachillis and Durness formed part of Reay estates which were acquired by the Marquis of Stafford in  The population of these parishes by the last census is as follows Assynt   Storr quoad sacra  together 
Narrow roads
Just horse roads bridle paths
The roads which were made have cost  s d and the brauch roads  s
The paths many of which are in the Reay forest have cost  s d
Cross roads leading from main or public roads
Some of them are and some are not some are farm roads
By the farmers
They are to townships in some instances
When they are for crofters the crofters maintain them themselves
Very desirous
What the Duke generally does now when they ask for a branch road or anything for their own convenience is to sayThat is a thing for you to do yourselves but he offers to provide an overseer and give tools for the work in various cases
Yes
In the year  when the potato disease came upon us there was expended upon meal and seed and grain by the Duke of Sutherland for this district  s  d  and in   s d
Of these sums there were recovered or received by work or labour or money  s d leaving a balance of  Is d which never was paid
In these years there was spent on emigration  s d by the Duke of Sutherland in sending people at their own special request to America
On trenching and draining there was laid out  over the district
No partly upon the crofts and partly on the large farmsall set agoing however for the employment of the people
The poor rates and school rates are a very heavy burden on this district
That may be but we consider it very heavy
In Assynt  s d on account of the poor
I know he attempted to remove people and I know by tradition and the talk of the country that there was a very disagreeable riot in Durness in consequence
That is so
Oh dear no
Yes
I can easily understand that this is a very sore subject with them
I dont concur in that opinion
I think their condition this year has been bad and that that is working very much on their minds
I think they are materially better off a good deal than they were before
It has and I think it has been a very great improvement that it has done so
I think there is that upon every estate you will go to
I never saw an estate yet where there was constant satisfaction and I am sure that is your own experience
Under every proprietor and factor let them be as kind and good and liberal as they may there will be some dissatisfied spirits
The rents of this district were never better paid than they were last year
The arrears at this moment are a mere bagatelle
I dont think they are much over  But we are very particular about the payment of the rents not for the value of the rents but for the benefit of the people themselves because we consider that it is a very great stimulus to exertion on the part of the tenant that he knows he must pay his rent at the proper timeit makes him industrious and strive to earn it
I have not the least doubt but a number do that
I think so
The fact is the crop here is a very small affair compared with the stock
There are cases of people without stock
They never paid a farthing for the making of these roads but they pay for keeping them up
Yes
The county of Sutherland has a special Road Act for itself in which Road Act there was a clause to the effect that no new roads were to be made
The consequence was that all new roads made were made at the expense of the landlord
The landlord paid them wholly out of his own pocket and maintained them a great many years
But we came to have a general Road Act which passed a few years ago and a number of these roads were added to the county roads and are now under the management of the Road Trustees
There were from Bonar Bridge to Tongue and from Bonar Bridge to the boundary of Caithness
The Road Trustees
I suppose they had but that was before my day
When I came here there were Road Trustees
To the Road Trustees
Every farmer paying over a certain sum was a trustee and every heritor was a trustee
No
These new schools principally but not wholly
It is the law
Because it was the crofting population that created the necessity for the outlay
Well I think education has deteriorated since the departure from the old parochial system
It is a new subject to me
He would and that is the fault of the law because formerly every parish schoolmaster was obliged to submit to examination in order to ascertain if he was able to teach Greek Latin and Mathematics and all subjects suited to enable him to go into the profession at present many of the teachers have no Latin or Greek or any of the classics
The whole or a very large portion of the county of Sutherland here is under sheep farms and has a very small population and the population such as it is is very much dotted on the seacoast
That is going back to a time before you or I was born and it is a subject upon which I have no knowledge whatever
There has been no such removal in my time
I think if the people were living in a bad climate and poor circumstances where they could not support themselves it was not such a cruel thing to remove them to where they could live better
I have heard that stated
There was a great complaint made that there was no pier at Rispond but there is a pier at Rispond for which the Duke of Sutherland paid a great deal of money
I cannot answer that question it was before my day
There are very fine natural harbours
There was a number of fishermen from that county fishing from Loch Laxford this year
I suppose here at Loch Inchard there is a very good harbour
Just inside where the steamer is anchored they come and they can get to sea very easily from there
There are a great many places they come from
But I grant you this that there is a great want of piers and I think that is very much more felt since steam communication become so common because steamers must have piers to go to at all times of the tide
They cannot remain till the tide will rise they must go away and there is an absence of piers along the coast of this district which I have myself represented to the Duke of Sutherland
I consider there is a necessity and I think if there were those piers there would be much more likelihood of curers and fishing coming to the place
Their communication is almost wholly by sea with Thurso
They are very large farms
That is not in my district but they are large farms
There have been a few crofters placed on that ground also as well as farmers
Well it is a very adverse climate
It has been found that the climate about Lairg is very unsuitable for arable farming
I can only speak for my own district and I dont consider there is any soil or climate in my district to which crofters could go and where I could say they could farm with advantage
I dont profess to be so
I have a very small farm
I cannot say they are for they sell very cheap
I dont think there is any which has ever been turned over with the plough
It may have been with the caschcrom and spade
No I dont think there is  acres in the three parishes which you could say had been so cultivated
No I dont think there is
The Duke of Sutherland came round this district to search for land and he went away with the impression that there was no such thing to be had
And then the expense of taking in any land in a rocky stony country of this sort is such that it will never pay either the landlord or the tenant
I would recommend a number of people to do what I have practised myself
I am the father of seven sons and not one of these seven sons has remained with me
They went to India and Australia and Cape of Good Hope and to England they went to fight their battle in the world and I would recommend very strongly to the crofters of this county that their families should go and do the same
I would but I had no way for him
I could not afford to keep him at home
I wish that were the case
If you give a new farm say to twenty crofters this year in twenty years you will have forty families on it
Let you lay down all the rules and laws you can
It has been the most trying subject with the management of this district and I am sure it is the same on every other large estate upon the west coast
I can only speak as to this district
Yes
Yes
I think for their own good and the good of those who remain one half  should go away
They are going away in spite of us
We cannot get the farms let
We will have all the sheep farms in the country on our own hands in a short time
I may tell you that the Duke advertised two farms this year and there never was a single candidate for either
No I dont think it is it was a profitable business for a number of years a number of people made fortunes on them but it is very much the reverse now
The benefit to the country is that it is always desirable for the landlord and the country that the tenantry should be thriving and prosperous
There is nothing more trying than a poor tenantry to the proprietor
I want no more if they will conduct themselves according to the rules of the estate
I have every sympathy and every kind feeling towards them
I have been brought up amongst the same class all my life and anything I recommend I recommend for their good
Perhaps his farm was not adapted for anything else
There are sheep farms in this district that you could not make ten acres of arable ground out of
He drains his land
If there is arable land upon it but it is a very scarce article I am sorry to say
Oh yes for his own good and when he is bound by his lease he wishes to perform the conditions of it
I think every tenant is exacting if you come to that
A tenant who pays  or  a year must have a good house
We charge a fixed rent and lay on a certain sum and charge no interest
We put everything into good order at the beginning of the lease and we fix the same which should be laid out and the tenant is bound during his lease to keep the houses dykes and everything in good order and so to leave them at the end of the lease
I dont know any case of that kind in this district
I can give you particulars of the improvements in Assynt but I think it would be more proper to give them there rather than here
I dont think that because we are in the habit of giving away slates and lime to the tenants and rebuilding their houses if they are going to build
No doubt the crofters have to lay out a good deal of money in building the houses
It is a serious matter for a crofter to build a house
I dont think so that is not my opinion
I dont know what they are in Tongue
If a tenant is going to build a new house he gets wood and glass and slate on credit payable in three instalments at the end of three years and a very large sum has been expended in the parish on slates and given to the people and a very great part has not been paid
No but he gets couples for the roof and wood for the windows and doors that is all
Yes Mr George Loch
Yes there have been very few houses built in Durness and there has not been so much given there as in other parishes but there have been one or two good houses built in Durness and the people have been assisted in the way I have described
The crofts are perhaps too small as a rule but where the croft has anything like  or  acres and a man pays close attention to it he can do
I suppose it is a necessity of their situation
What I should do would be to enlarge the crofts by adding vacant ones to others but it rarely happens that we can do that
Some have and some have too much
Very nearly but not quite
I think not more
I think so
They are limited to a certain number according to the rents and they can only keep that number however prosperous they are
I think they had a few years ago
Yes a great many cattle were sold last year owing to the good prices in the latter end and even now that is going on
There are high prices going just now for cattle
Well there is only the one doctor for the two parishes of Eddrachillis and Durness
The house built for him was at Badcall and it is the fact that it is not in a central position
It was proposed that he should be brought to a central position at the head of Loch Inchard but when we came to consider what it would cost it was found that it would take  and the Duke declined to be at that outlay
 from each of the parishes and the Duke of Sutherland gives   and a free house and he has his chance of practice besides
I would like extremely that such an arrangement could be carried out but it is want of means that is the difficulty
Yes but a man of sufficient education and intelligence would be difficult to find
I think it would be very unlikely for them to agree
There would be very apt to be such a feeling
I think as a rule in this district the people have every cause to have confidence in the School Boards as they exist
I should think so their own clergyman  and I have always been most anxious that there should be one of their own clergy upon every board
I deny the truth of that
It was the Duke of Sutherland they referred to but I deny the truth of the statement
I think it is a most unfounded assertion I think it was a very unfair statement
Rev
Mr Ross
That is an inference made from a statement of mine
It is in my written statement what I mentioned about the doctor
I made a motion the terms of which I forget and I mentioned in my evidence in answer to questions that General Scobie always supported me and that Mr Clark always supported me but that when I made the motion it was not seconded
It was a statement of my own easily explained that the farmers were near the time of renewing their leases and the inference which has been stated from my examination I dont concur in
You had your own examination which was of considerable length and you had a fair share of our time and I dont think that I can take your examination over again
Two years only
Invernessshire  I was born there
No this is my first charge
No but I want to make a few remarks about secondary education
We are at a disadvantage about that boys that are getting up after thirteen cannot be educated here
The teacher is willing to educate them if there was room to teach them but the schoolroom seems to be too small
The boys last year wished to go for education during winter and the teacher could not take them he has enough to do to teach the children under thirteen
I heard it stated that the rooms are too small
Down here at Insheigra there are a great many past age but there is no room in the school for them
I was told so
There are sixtysix scholars within school age in the district
Yes I think it is pretty large
I dont know as to the regularity of the attendance I am not a member of the School Board and have not been often in the school
Yes I was told so by the boys
They went to the other school in this end of the parish and the teacher there has more room but the parents in that end objected to children from this end of the parish going to be educated there and sent in a petition to the teacher so that he had to dismiss them and not allow them into his school
They must be selftaught I suppose
We have a very clever boy here at present
He was the first in the examination of the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge
He used to attend school until now that he is over school age
He is past the age now
I am not aware if the teacher would take him in after this and be is too delicate his father considers to send him from home
I dont know what he is to do in winter
I think so but I am not quite sure
Yes I think that is the fact
There are two Board Schools in this districtone at Insheigra and the other at Old Shore
I dont hear any complaints of one of them being too small but I have heard it repeatedly said that it is the smallness of the schoolroom at Insheigra that is the difficulty
It is quite crowded with children within school age
I am not aware
I was not here at the time it was built
No except the doctor
We would join to get a doctor
That is a general complaint although we are not so far from him as the Durness people
The doctor is about nineteen miles from us
Another grievance is that we have not a smith in this place and have to send for him seventeen miles to Scourie
I have heard it said that no smith could be had without a croft
I heard it stated that no one could be got that he could not support himself with what he could earn at his trade without a croft
Yes seventeen miles
As to the means of communication if we could get the railway which the former delegate spoke of it would be of the greatest benefit to this district and also a telegraph line
Lairg fortysix miles
I think the telegraph would benefit the fishing class
The telegraph and the railway would be the making of the place
The means of communication here are very bad
We have to get all our goods from Thurso by smack
The vessel goes round by Cape Wrath and is often a long time by the way
Last winter the people sometimes ran out of meal and had to use the seed they were keeping and turn it into meal
A good many small ones but there is not a general one which keeps a large stock of everything
Three of them deal in meal
Yes by the smack and from Wick too
It would be a great benefit to have the steamer which goes in to Badcall three miles from Scourie
Nineteen
Thirty miles
Not since I came here but I suppose there have been
He is very often needed down here
The doctor himself is not well this season  he was nearly dead with going about so much
To Kyle Sku I believe
He has not many people on the other side
Yes I believe it has
I believe not
Yes
Close on two miles
Yes
No I think not
I should think so
There are a great many boys above school age
Some of them did I am not aware if they do now
Some boys would like to attend school in winter
It has been built since the new Act came into force
I am not aware that they have
I have not heard that they did
No
Mr Mlver
Three
One at Scourie
I am not aware that they have
Is it the compulsory officer you mean
No I was not appointed
Perhaps they have appointed the other minister Mr Lundie who is a member of the board
I am not a member of the board
I am not aware but the parents have been often complaining to me about the want of secondary education
I did not do anything
Perhaps they have done it themselves before my coming here
I am not long here
Ninepencefourpence halfpenny on tenants and fourpence halfpenny on landlords
The teacher stated to me that he would have difficulty even if he had room
I suppose so
I dont know as to the other schools
I suppose Scourie school is very well taught
I think there is plenty of room there but I dont know
I think there should be some way of getting secondary education
That would be desirable there is no doubt of that
We are so far away from any town here to send them to that the parents cannot afford to send their children should they be willing and there is no one rising up
The people say that clever boys got on far better under the old system
Several boys from here became teachers and some of them preachers during the old time
In the parish lay schools and now there is no one rising above the common level
I am speaking generally
Yes
I should say they are better off here than in the south end of MullRoss of Mull
No
The houses are inferior here some of them
Yes
I should say so they have more pasture
I dont know as to the rents
No but there are some of the people very poor there
No
Yes I agree with what our own delegates stated and I agree also with the statements of the Durness people generally as to the medical officer and so on
Yes I do because it is impossible for them to winter their cattle that is the great complaint
More arable land is what is needed and I think their pasture land might be improved if it were drained
Very few of them have I think but I think the houses should be improved and that would increase the comfort of the people in every way
The cattle go in by the same door in some of the houses and in some instances there are two families in one house which is very undesirable
No not in one room I think they generally have two at least
In some houses there are the family of the father and of an elder married son
That seems to have been allowed by the laws of the estate
I think they live in family
I think they live just like one family and have sleeping apartments
Some of them have a closet and two rooms
Yes in some cases
Yes I know one in this very place a pauper and she lives in a house where there is no partition between her and the cow
Yes her daughter is with her
It is her daughter who has the cow
The old woman is the pauper
I should think so at any rate but I dont hear complaints
I would not like to live in such a place
I am not aware that such is the case I never heard of our having such an official as a health officer
I never heard of his going round  but there may be such an officer
The inspector of poor Mr Mlver informs me is sanitary officer
Mr Chisholm Scourie
He lives at Scourie seventeen miles from here
He comes I think occasionally
I dont know him very well yet
I have not but he may have done it
I think he would get plenty of work to do in that way
Not since I came here
I have not but I have never inquired about that
I suppose there has been fever but not in my time
Mr Mackenzie Established Church minister of Eddrachillis Mr MIver  the factor chairman Mr Louis Mlver Rev
Mr Lundie and the Free Church minister of Scourie
Yes 
In Scourie
Yes
Yes
Yes
I dont know I never was there  but I dont think he has
I cannot say
I think the people belong to the Free Church generally
I dont think so
Mr Mlver asked me to go on it but I declined at the time and gave my reasons to Mr Mlver
I had too much of it
Yes
No
No
Mr Chisholm
Mr Lundie is here but not Mr Mackenzie
I would like to speak of the condition of the poor fishermen in the district
In the first place they have bad boats and they have no lines nor herring nets so as to pursue the fishing with success
The harbour is bad and the land is bad
Many a time the people could work perfectly at sea when they could not come ashore the coast is so rocky
If we had a ready market for the fish the people could get a little money which they cannot get at the present time for their families and themselves
If the railway was extended to the head of Loch Laxford it would form an admirable centre for the districts of Durness and this parish of Eddriachillis and so the people would be able to send their fresh fish to the market
That is about all I have got to say
Yes as good a crew as is to be had in the north of Scotland
There was a curer who came here different times but because there was no suitable landing place and no suitable boats that could pursue the fishing with success the scheme did not succeed
Some do
I tried myself the fishing in that way but when I got into the curers debt then the price of the fish was reduced and having to get supplies all the same that put an end to that state of matters
Yes it would within the loch but the loch is very far inshore and distant from the fishing grounds
At Old Shore but it would be very expensive
A very suitable place could be erected at  Kinlochbervie for a moderate amount of money
Three or four of my neighbours
A boat of thirty feet keel
No
Five
At times she was  but of course a decked boat could go oftener to the banks than she was able to go
He used to give less for fish to those who were in his debt than to those who were not
Yes from Wick and Stornoway
Yes but herein is the difference the people upon the east coast get their supplies for perhaps about half the price that we pay for them
Our lines and nets and every thing we need it is so difficult to bring things here
by the curer giving us an orderand so advantage was taken of us by means of this line that the curer cave us
No because there is a moderate number of wealthy people round about him who would give him  assistance to buy his boat and material may be with ready cash
Yes but we have not the boats
They were not fishing with the same kind of boats when I went to the east coast fishing that they have now they are much larger now
Again they go further out fishing and they require a bigger class of boat
There is one in Scourie but none in this place
Between here and the end of the loch
No not altogether
Caithness
At times
I could not say if they were sent away but I knew they went away
I believe they were
I could not say exactly I do not wish to interfere with the like of that
Nothing else but the fishing
My lot is about two acres some are smaller and some larger than mine
One horse two cows and about twenty sheep
 I have only two cows now but I used to have more formerly
Nothing except that the rent is increased at a change of the tenure of bath father and son
There are eight widows in the place and their time is near about out like mine and when an increase of rent is put on the crofts will be too dear
I have been in the township for sixtyeight years and I have paid this rent for fiftyfour years altogether and my father paid it before me
We dont say it is too dear just now we complain of the smallness of the holdings
When the potatoes fail our crofts dont support us for three months
They would be too small supposing we had twice the amount of land we have
I used to fish as long as I was able but now I can neither fish nor till the land
Some make it out of their stock and some make it out of their fishing
In general they are very poor
They are getting worse
Last year was an exceptional year and the crofts would not keep them a month
That they have nothing in the world to support them and the smallness of the holding
The lots were the same but there are more people on them now the people are more crowded than they were then
The crofts are getting worse the croft cannot yield as good crop
The crofts are not sufficiently large to enable us to leave out some of the land to give it a rest
No not by the proprietor but there are some lots with two families upon them all the same
At that time the proprietor was not opposed to there being two families upon one lot
No
One family would require three of the lots
I dont think it right that the lots should be subdivided there too many upon them as it is
The price of stock is higher now but there are some of the people without any stock
What benefit would that be to a man who has no stock at all there are some without stock
The people are very much poorer and if it was not for gentlemen sending us money the merchant in Thurso and the merchant in Wick there would be famine in the land some years
The cause of the poverty is that the people have so little land to support them
There are some of the houses very bad
I have myself built a house that would suit if the other things were all right
I got from Mr MIver   to assist in building a house
He offered me also slate but I would not undertake the repayment of it in three years
I could not buy wood either for   would go but a little way in buying wood
To give the people more land
We are so poor we cannot build houses
That would be a great matter to do and the people would need it but I dont want such an arrangement
No
Yes by the people of Tarbert and Eddriachillis
That the crofters of this parish had been evicted by their proprietor from their comfortable dwellings to the most barren spots of the parish that the small quantity of that same is quite inadequate to support the life of those who does labour it
The smallness of it leaves no room for rotation so that constant cultivation of it weakens the soil that it cannot yield crop to the advantage of the crofter
Therefore year by year their condition is getting more deplorable
There are plenty of good land in this parish under sheep which if properly divided and cultivated would give the crofters ample room for to live comfortable by their own industry
The way in which this could be effected is that ten acres of good arable land would be given to each tenant with a lease of nineteen years at a reasonable rent by a competent and impartial judge under Government control as the land should pay its own rent
As seasons is coming across every country that some failure may appear in the crop every tenant should have some sheep so as to enable him to have support from his stock
Through the poverty prevailed among the crofters they are unfit to buy sheep for their land
But the Government should buy sheep for them at three and half per cent per annum and the full amount to be paid in ten years time in various instalments
Their whole proceedings is carried on in the name of the Duke of Sutherland
If grudge or objections is offered by the crofters the alternative is quit the estate
We were paying roads on rent for fortynine years back but no part is granted as yet
There was a great praise given by his own officials to the second Duke of Sutherland for granting a free passage to many people from his estate
But as far as known to me not a foot of that peoples land was given to the remaining crofters turned to a sheep walk
Another grievance is deeply felt hereWhen the heads of the families are going to their long home an additional rent is charged upon the croft say fr om ten to twenty shillings more
If asked why is this extra rent charged a crooked answer is given that will not stand the light of truth
Through the illiterate condition of our forefathers no recourse was obtained through the publick prints of face land so that our forefathers were branded by false reports and defamation of character
But the just judge showed his displeasure against those who depopulated the people reduced them to beggary and sent them off the face of the earth with the besom of destruction as he foretold in his holy Word
The most stout and healthy lads belonging to this parish had to quit their native country as no room was allowed for them to build houses and marriage being prohibited so that the most weak and helpless of them are left
In regard of fishing in this part of the country there lies in the main ocean a bank say from twenty to thirty miles off where cod and ling is plentiful the only way among us to hive the benefit of that fish is large decked boats and a small boat to work their lines but very few of us can obtain such boats as no fishcurers are residing in this part of the country and no markets for them neither a harbour but what is formed by nature so that various drawbacks is meeting our fishermen
The amount of money paid for meal annually by this parish is great so that clothing and food is not what it ought to be
All that privations is attributed to the want of land to support the people by their own industry
Southwest from here
I was born in the parish of Assynt and went to Tarbert in  for causes which I am not willing to mention here
Yes
Yes
Yes
It is pretty fair in regard to cattle
I have four cows a horse and about seven sheep but of late a good many of these had to be sold for meal not by me but off the lot
Formerly it was    s but now it is raised with dues and things of that description to    s d taking poor rates and school rates together
Yes
Yes
Rather too high as rents go
I dont know a crofter whose land supports him more than five months in the year
If there is one in our parish I should like to know him
We must live by meal or starve
I can hardly state that with any at curacy
Yes
It would not support me
Once upon a time when I was able but old age and other disabilities prevent me now
Yes and the herring fishing
If people had proper boats and a proper way of curing fish the fishing is very productive but also very precarious
February March and April and sometimes it is carried on until June
Excellent men from Banffshire Morayshire and various parts are inhabiting our country at that season of the year
A lot of fish
They get money in their own country for the fish
They do
Yes and doing well according to the materials they have
Those who are doing well can but they must take it from Banff Aberdeen or Peterhead  such materials are not got in this country to the same advantage as on the east coast
Who would buy their fish but the factor
There is none to buy them there is no one able to buy them
Yes to Aberdeen or Stornoway or Peterhead and various parts
There is one farm
Mr Gunns farm Kyle Strome and I hold that would supply all the crofters in Eddriachillis
Yes
Kylesku where people could live although for the last few years there have not been many
I have had thoughts of that at times for a man is at liberty to have his own thoughts though they are not correct sometimes
A good many
It was all done under the Sutherland familys name there were inferiors under them but it was all done in their name
Mr Charles Clark who lived in Glendhu and was a scourge to the country in his lifetime
He belonged to this same country but for all that he died a beggar
There were many of them away at the east coast fishing so that many of them were not present
Those who were present sent me as one to this place in order to meet the Commission and their words are set down by me in my paper in my own broken English
Certainly it was
Yes a few townships Eddrachillis Tarbert Foindale and others in this end of the parish
But there are more people to speak after me
Yes and a factor and a clerk and a poor inspector and what not
No we dont
No but because he is an inferior and therefore should submit to his superior
Of course my lord whether you are a lord or a gentleman you would be displeased if your servants did not do your bidding  a servant must obey
No
Part of it I am rather dull of hearing
Certainly the rest would but my days are numbered and with all the good the Commission can do it would be madness for me to try it
I dont speak for myself but for the rest of my country
Quite glad
It is not consistent with reason that men reduced to poverty would be able to buy stock at first but in such a good pasture the stock would pay itself
A great deal under sheep and in deer forest
No
We are quite close to the shore we are not allowed to go up where they are
There is a road through the forest we have nothing to say about the man who occupies the forest
He is a kind nobleman the Duke of Westminster
No
I think I have said enough if well considered
I am glad such a competent judge would give me that character
At home I have been once or twice in Glasgow but it was little learning I got there
No
I attended the old parochial school in Assynt
In childhood I was such a long distance from school that I did not attend but in my young days I was bestowed with a good memory and I learned some of my English from books
It is not very easy for me to remember owing to the shortness of my memory
I stated the extent of the parish of Durness
It contains more acreage than any other parish around acres
I took that from what are said to be Government returns and the rental according to the rent roll is  All that the crofters from s to   of rental pay is  The population of Durness is the smallest in this county namely  and it has been always diminishing for several decades
There are  crofters paying as I said from s to  Their holdings are very small some I learn having only one or one and a half acres to two and a half and perhaps up to five acres
My own glebe which I hold under his Grace is about four acres in extent and I pay  minus cL The holdings are small
No one family could make a livelihood on the produce of their crop neither could any fisherman make a livelihood by his labour and the produce from the sea according to the present arrangementthat is the want of road transit to the market besides the wild nature of the coast and the want of sufficient boats and fishing gear
They have no road to the market and the lobsters are often lost
If it is cold frosty weather they die while they are being sent to London and often they lose them in the sea
In February last they lost their gear round Cape Wrath and out of  which was returned to them from Billingsgate for lobsters they had to pay about  in replacing their fishing gear
The crofts are not subdivided
The system pursued is this that where parents get old and frail the son or soninlaw goes into the house with the understanding that he will support the parents but this son and his young family growing up finds it hard and difficult to get on as the croft will not maintain one family and there are two on it
There are several complaints of shortcomings and tightness and of tenants murmuring as to their being deprived long ago of strips of arable land which was added to the sheep farms
There was a case from Durinia big park which they had thirty years ago for putting in their lambs or calvesthat was before the present management and some scores of acres were taken from them and added to Balnoskail
The tenants resisted that but without avail
They maintain that they got no reduction of rent or compensation for the loss of this park except that the Balnoskail farm dropped the custom of sending their sheep up the hill to a loch to be washed and dried on the grazing
I have also been told that in addition to the crofters and small farmers the large farmers when they get arable land that is the tacksmenclaim a share of the grazing on the hill
The tenants dispute their right and say part of the grazing on the hill was cut off and added to the large farms
These are disputed points between them
Last year also they were deprived of grazing of their horses at Foinaven
They had an ancient right or privilege of sending a horse to the grazing ground for the number of tenants is limited
Now they had the privilege of grazing a horse on Foinaven for ages past and they were deprived of that last year
They got an order and some were to be ejected and some did not obey
They got notice from the factors office
I took part in this and helped to write the petition not to send horses last year but some did send them
Those who did send them were fined s
I assisted them in writing a petition to the Duke but I quite forgot the matter when the Duke was in the parish last year and did not speak to him about it
The result was that this s tax was made perpetual for herding and grazing
Formerly the tenants paid Is d for each horse for herding them and now they are bound under an obligationthey do not get a copy of it themselves but there is a paper sent to them individually to sign an agreement of that sortto pay s yearly
The proprietor undertook then both to allow the grazing of a horse and also the herding for s a horse
Formerly they paid Is d
They remove the horses about the first week of August before the shooting commences
Some of the people demurred to sign this paper because there were some blanks in it not filled up
Then there was a threat that if they did not sign it they would be reported to the office as disloyal and this frequently happens
I may say however that there might be explanations as to some parts of it and those who had this right before any change was made in the law of the estate got their horses I believe for s d but there are very few of these surviving
The rest pay s
They paid it the first year as a fine
They thought they had the right to the grazing and the right was resisted
As to Sangobeg and Laidh I am pretty familiar with the people and their circumstances
They are poor and no family can live on their croft alone
They must provide the rent large or small and most of their livelihood they get from other sources either at home or from home
The fishing classes go to the herring fishing in the summer and they generally fish lobsters in the winter and  spring
The land is not fit for cultivation
The people have no facilities for fishing but Loch Eriboll and their stock are fed on the seaware on the shore and on the hill pastureheather
Their stock have pretty fair advantages so far as the summer and autumn are concerned and partly in spring feeding on the seaware and also on the heather but they will have very little off the crofts but provender to support them in winter and they make very little
Their only resource if the potatoes succeed and they get fish is potatoes and fish particularly if they succeed in the herring fishing
With the privileges of country air and home and plenty water and milk and potatoes and fish they could live comfortable as to the necessaries of life but when these fail the people are very badly off
Last year the potatoes failed and much of the little crop they had was destroyed by the severe gale of October st
The produce failed and the fishing has failed for two or three years and the little meal people had last year they used in spring
They were accordingly in want of seed as well as meal
It was for seed that I was mainly apprehensive
We applied to the Mansion House Fund for aid mainly for seed but in some cases a few families are and always will be poor
We got  of a grant from the Mansion House Fund  from the Duke of Westminster and   from other sportsmenaltogether about  We also got fifty bolls of meal from the Glasgow committee and employment was given at road making
Some poor people if they were in destitute circumstances also got a little meal
Any little oats they grew they must keep for their horses
The Durnie people have horses but not the people at Sangobeg
Some of them have two cows and a calf the same as myself
I keep no horse
Once or twice only have I put some bailey to the mill during the last twelve years
I am a member of the Parochial Board and always have pleaded for having a doctor nearer than thirty miles off
Several cases of emergency would pass the crisis before the doctor could be got
Sometimes a foot runner is sent off to Scourie and sometimes a rider and it might be the second or third day before the doctor came and several times the disease has been at the crisis before the doctor could reach the place
Since I came here eight sen years ago we have had I think seven doctors
One died and the next had to leaveI was told he was ordered to leaveanother Dr Smith had a dispute with the factor
The doctors stand on their professional etiquette and do not like to take orders
Even from a duke I suppose
I tried to make things quiet
The next one left too in some huff or other
Dr MCallum left of his own accord
Dr Ross left a year or two ago and went to Islay and now we have the seventh doctor
The late General Scobie supported me always in trying to get a doctor for the parish and we applied to the Duke through the factor to get a share of the grant which he gives
The Duke gives  to help to get a doctor for the two parishes of Eddrachillis and Durness
If we got  from the Duke and  from the Lighthouse Commissioners we agreed that we would assist the parish to make up a salary for a doctor
Mr Mlver sometimes saidwhat would we do with Eddrachillis
and I said that was their look out We pay half of the doctors salary and the doctor lives three miles from Scourie
We never have a contested election for anything
The way that it is done is this I believe the order comes up to Durness and the ground officer gets two men or his son who is inspector of poor
Formerly we had not a resident inspector of poor and I objected to that
He used to be resident at Scourie
He was given to intemperance and when he came to pay the paupers at Durness he was very often incompetent and I objected to that
We have now a resident inspector the ground officers son
That is another office which is in the same family but I do not object to that at all
I am satisfied with the fact that he is resident
No we had not at any time
So far as I know they are not satisfied with the school arrangements but as to the School Board they often wish me to return to it
They are not satisfied in that respect but I did not return to it
Mr Mlver wished me to return but I would not
There are very few electors resident
I suppose they require to pay a rent of   before they can get a vote and there are very few of that class
Yes
Very few
No very few pay  and  is the usual
There may be a dozen paying  but not more
The Board was elected according to statute
Five Mr Mlver is chairman
He represents the Duke of Sutherland on both boards
Mr Clark Emboli Mr Swanson Rispond and myself
Yes
Two
Yes
There are no elders in the parish
Yes
I often said so but it happened that it would be of no avail
At every change of doctor I voted for it and once I made a motion but it was not seconded
It was very near the renewal of the leases and the large farmers quite naturally avowed they did not like to oppose the authorities at the time of renewal of the lease
It would be according to the requirements of the statute
I am not aware at this moment j I am not positive that I can answer the question directly
The smallness of crofts
the labour and work and toil arising makes the whole produce of the crofter accordingly dear
The rents considering other matters are not too high
As regards my own croft I would not cultivate it at all if I could get dairy produce
I am ordered to live on  milk and I keep a cow or two but I pay for all the work on the croft horse work and peoples work and the produce of the ground costs me double more than I could buy it for anywhere else
So that the produce is very dear considering the labour but the rents are not
Oh 
yes mine can be ploughed 
The subject is a very poor one and as I have no horse I cannot collect manure
The soil is poor and gets exhausted from continual cropping and seaware the soil gets thinner and poorer and  consequently the crop is poorer and weaker and is more subject to be driven by the gales in autumn
Some of the larger crofts now sow grass and turnips but although they sow grass they would need to have lots fenced to keep the sheep off from destroying the young grass and corn
This was resisted
By the representative of the proprietor
I remember my neighbour putting a wire round to keep sheep off and the ground officer came and insisted that it should be taken down
Some of the neighbours are opposed to fences because all the crofts are not fenced and if the croft of one were fenced their sheep would not get in on his grass to use it as common and they hold that his sheep would get on to their ground that it would require all the crofts to be fenced
Quite so on the arable land
In this case he was not
Those who fenced took in their own sheep in time of lambing and kept them on their own ground and if they have any yeald sheep they put them on the hill and the people pay so much for a shepherd and the ground officer has the management of the sheep
I lost all my barley this year at the time of clipping
The shepherd put all the clipped sheep west near my park and went away to dinner and when some person came they were all in my barley and they could not get them out
The ground officer has to keep up the sheep and those who fence their crofts can keep the sheep at the time of lambing on their own crofts and with regard to the yeald sheep the ground  officer having a shepherd it is his duty to keep them off
I do not know his reason but that is the reason so far as we can interpret it and so far as we can learn it that no one croft should be fenced because his ground was then shut out from the other sheep
The ground officer himself has a larger flock than several of the tenants
No
I was not so well conversant with that but I heard of cases where they were improving and building houses and I heard of cases where the ground officer stopped them for taking the drift sand along the seashore and then he said they might go on with it
I know another where the ground officer stopped a man from building his house and afterwards let him go off
It is a delicate matter and I would not like to tell the names because the people are under intimidation from the influence I mentioned whether well founded or not they are afraid of such influences
It was not the man himself who told me of the second case but his neighbour and as I am not well versed or grounded in it perhaps it would not be wise to mention the names
It was read at the meeting on Tuesday
There would be about forty men present
The substance of it was mentioned at previous meetings at which there were fifty or sixty crofters present
I had a meeting called about the Commissioners visit
The people were hesitatingand I readily got a person to be a delegate
There was another meeting at which I was not present
About nine or ten of them came up to my house but the things in the paper were discussed at the meeting at which there were fifty or sixty people present men and lads
Yes Mr Murdoch of the Highlander was at one meeting last week
I knew him in Islay nearly forty years ago and he wrote me and came to my house
He was at the meeting for a short time
My mind is not cast entirely in his mould
I was for a short time at his meeting but it was so heated that I did not stay long
I saw him he passed through
He wrote me a card and I came up and saw him
I must have met him in Gairloch when I was visiting the schools
I did not know who he was but he thinks I must have met him at Gairloch
No but he had a meeting with the delegates
He saw some of them in my presence and I heard that he saw others
I am not sure if he saw them all
I am not aware of that
Not personally
No I am dissatisfied with the system
I would not go that length
I do not think my statement would go that length
The teacher I believe does his best and does not spare himself
No
No
I think I stated the reverse
I said I had no objection to the poor inspector
The former one was intemperate but I was dissatisfied with this part of it that the late inspector when the change was made got a pension off Durness parish
He is still inspector at Scourie
Yes
I am not dissatisfied with the people generally
I mentioned some things in the system and in the actings that have in my opinion a prejudicial effect upon the spirit of the people
I wont go that length
No it would not be right
I resisted a few things
I hope I am understoodI stated a few things arising from these influences and this system
They tend to deteriorate the minds of the people and discourage them
The factor is there
I am not dissatisfied with himI think he is a competent man
I am not dissatisfied with him as chairman of the School Board but what I am dissatisfied with is his assuming authority without a fair consideration of the whole
Things seem to us as if they were branded in his office and come cut and dry to us
I think him the most competent and perhaps the best man for the place as I stated in my paper
Yes for several decades
Yes
It is the largest I have seen in the Government statement
It is larger than the neighbouring parishes according to the rent roll
There are some in Sutherland larger up to  or 
I am not satisfied with that
I presume it would be so
I did apply
I did
That is a thing I am not aware of as yet
The Duke of Sutherland supplied seed on the credit of this money and I cannot say how far the money may be applied to the payment of this seed
Some of the people got employment and the money they received may have been devoted to the payment of the seed or not we do not know
It was banked and the ground officers son is treasurer
It is in the bank in his name for the Relief Committee
John Gunn
He is not a native
He comes from Caithness I believe
I believe it is but I am subject to correction in that
Nothing else occurs to me except that at present
I believe he does but I am not conversant with his dealings in that respect
I am not aware at present
Formerly he used to keep tea and butter
He used to take cattle and lambs and sheep he used to sell these and in some cases got the money and any work that was going would be got from him
I believe that is the case so far as I know
He has a pretty large croft larger than ours
It is not on the roll so far as I can discover
It is not in the roll so far as I am aware
I believe not
I am not aware
The Durnie lands are pretty goodthree or four acres but the other townships are of a very poor description and very small narrow strips
No only at Loch Erriboll but it is  miles up the loch from us
The crofter population is within  miles of the road in a triangle a small spot
Laid Loch Erriboll I believe was gathered up from part of Rispond and the land connected with it
Yes
Very poor principally on the Loch Erriboll side
There are four sheep farms and part of another
The largest sheep farm I think pays 
Mr Scott of Bulnaskail but he is not there in winter
Erriboll pays  I think
He used to be but he stays in Rossshire a good deal in winter
Keoldale
Mr Scobie I think is paying the same rent for Keoldale as Erriboll but part of that is in Kinlochbervie
Mr John Scobie is and his brother General Scobie was before him
Yes
Well yes
There are various standards of goodness
Rispond a smaller farm
 The other portion of the rental is all over the side of Loch Erriboll and a portion of Melness
The portion belonging to Durness pays upwards of 
There is no room to increase there can be no marriages no house or land can be got
It is against the law of the estate and perhaps it is a good law
am not against everybody and everything and although it is a hardship that young people cannot marry yet the law of the estate is good that they should not marry without a house and lands and no houses or land can be got
They must leave when they rise in the world they cannot settle
If they were educated to trades they would leave
The land at present is tied under lease and there is no room for extension of the population
Certainly
There must be slices taken off the large farms around both arable land and hill share and share
Yes
As to the dates of the historical part of it I do not think I am competent to answer as I was not resident here
They have not been getting larger since I came here
I am not sure as to the dateswhether they were larger before the Sutherland family came into possession or under Lord Reay
I rather think that many of them were placed there by the Reay family but my memory does not serve me accurately upon that
I did not myself
Yes
Generally I know the statute requires a medical officer but in my opinion and that of a great many the law of the estate is sufficient for many things
For instance the superannuation of the inspector of poor
I used to see a discussion in Parliament to enable boards to grant a superannuation allowance
Durness did not need an Act of Parliament to do so
The Board of Supervision has large powers I believe but what they are I am not competent to say
My time is about done I am an invalid
Yes that was in  or
There was the Established Church minister and factors and Mr George Clark
I forget who was the fifth but I think it was Mr Swanson of Rispond
Scarcely that but I was more in contact with the parents of the children
No doubt I would think that
Yes
I suppose there was
I think for the time being it was Mr Mlvera son but I am not sure
Yes
I think it was by the members of the board as far as I recollect
I cannot think that
I think so
I do not think so
I was getting into delicate health and I did not think I would succeed in doing any good
If I thought it would be of any use I would do it
There is one in Tongue a native of Durness
His parents were attendants and adherents of my church
I am not aware of any so far as I recollect at this moment
There is none known to me
There is a side school to Loch Erriboll which is taught by a pupil teacher from Durness School
He is three months on this side of the Loch and three months on the other
I have been a carpenter amongst the crofters
Yes
From Sangobeg
The whole townthirty or forty of them altogether
Ithink there is one with Rev
Mr Ross if he comes round
I have been forty years at Sangobeg
There were tenants upon the whole of our ground and Rispond was a fishing port
There were twentyfive families removed to make a sheep farm
Twelve of them were sent in to Sangobeg
There are now twelve families in Sangobeg and there were only six before the change was made
We are deprived of the privileges of sea and land
The seaport is taken from us it is two miles for the nearest fisherman
We fish for every kind of fish that is needed and we dont get the proper use of them because we have no proper means of conveying them to the market
The lobsters die before they reach the market
The lobsters require to go alive to the market and we are sixty miles from the nearest railway station
There may be a merchant at hand for the fish which are brought ashore who will give an offer for what he wants himself but the rest are left in our hands
If we had a pier a telegraph station a doctor and some more of the land which has been taken from us we think we might get through as our forefathers did
We are without any privilege and it is very hard upon poor people
We must build houses and we only get one rent for building a house which will cost between  and  we buying lime from the Duke
It is only one rent that is granted us for the house and a thing that is very strangeupon the Tongue side they there get from glass which goes into the window to the floor that goes under their feet all the wood they required and we have the same proprietor
The slates for the house are paid in three instalments
There were six in Rispond farm brought into Sangobeg in addition to the six who were there previously
No new ground could be made it was the old ground that was given them
Yes two lots were made out of the one
About forty years
None since
There are no more now than forty years ago there is no place for them
One
The rent was divided amongst themequal rent
The two crofters had only to pay the rent of the one that was there previously
No
No
None from our township
Yes
Yes
A pier that a steamer could come to
Yes
Yes
Thirtyone miles
Send for him
At Scourie
I cannot answer that
I cannot tell
I do not know that part of the country
No
I think they would be better of one as we have often to send for one
Yes
No
There is no need for them
Yes
That very often happens
None but the back of a man
He must first go to the ware and then to the spade he must sow the seed and then harrow the ground after that and go threequarters of a mile up the hill for a creel of peats to make a fire that will make ready his breakfast
Yes
Yes
Yes it is
Everyone is so poor that he can scarcely make a living upon it

Fiftythree years

I forwarded it to the secretary Mr MNeill
I think last night
I forwarded it to Kinlochbervie as I scarcely expected to be present

Yes
Exactly
Yes
Yes he is present
Yes one Mr Anderson was here at the timethe previous factor
They were forced in upon us
It was too small
Yes
They were very poor
It was a loss to them
Many a time
We neither spoke nor wrote
No it is not a big farm
I cannot tell
It was a great loss
A great deal more in the condition in which they were
The reason is because anything we asked of him we never got
To the present Duke
We never got an answer to any application we ever made
In our township we have stopped
There are others here who know more about them than I
Alexander Swanson
I am certain it would make one and a half acres
Yes
Two cows and a calf but I cannot rear these upon the produce of my own ground
Yes
Twelve
 s
No
I donot think the rent too much but what sort of a living can a man make out of s worth of ground and when he has to work it with his own hands
About the same size
There are two in the township whose rents have been raised
I do not know
That is the reason ascribed to us for it that the rent is raised on the son succeeding
Ten shillings on s of rent
Yes although it would be   it would be easier for me to pay than s at present
It is just patches here and there
Yes
I was inside and outside at the same time
Mr MacHardy was in and outside and he spoke of it outside too
The words mentioned as far as I can remember were these that the factor sent him on purpose for her not to go out to vote that election dayif we wanted the factors favour not to go
Yes
Yes true

She understood it that he did not want her to go to vote for the person she intended to give her vote to
Yes
Not at the time
I dont recollectsome years
I cannot say only there were no arrears except one and there were others two years in arrears who were not summoned out
It was given to her son
Yes
He did not get it because the widow was not put out but he was ordered to get it by the factor
Yes
Yes
Ten years
I have
I have
I do
In the case of widow Murray on which so much stress has been laid it is stated that I intimidated her
The old woman told me before the election that she wished to vote for Mr Crawford
She was an old frail creature and on the morning of the election in case of any blame being attached to me for taking her out I called and wished her to stay at home
I had no idea Mr Mackenzie had her vote
It is said that we wished to put her out of her home
That is a wrong statement altogether because after the election when her horse died I gave her a foal myself and took the money by instalments
I wish to make that statement because it will go forth that we have been intimidating people
We did not wish to turn her out but the croft was to be transferred to her eldest son and a widow and eight children were staying there
Her eldest son is here
He was to give his mother so much weekly if he got charge of the lot and now we have heard that we wished to turn the widow adrift
She did but it was to give the charge of the lot to her eldest son
She was not to be removed from the house but the charge of the lot was to be conveyed to her eldest son
It was nearly three years after
None
She told me she would give her right hand upon it that she would vote for Mr Crawford but I knew he had plenty of votes without it and told her to stay at home
In her own house
I am in amongst the tenants houses every day and there was a good deal of influence tried at that election and the people were speaking to me and I was speaking to them about it when the widow told me she was to vote for Mr Crawford
I told her on the morning of the election I did not think there was any necessity for her coming out
I was going past and was not going into the house at all but I happened to see her son and if it had not been for that I dont think I would have gone in at all
I cannot be sure about that
Perhaps I spoke to her because there were four ministers wanting in and a fifth offering and it was a general desire of the parish not to put in five clerical members
I may
I am a ratepayer and a parent and I have a good right I think to speak to anybody I think proper  about that
I pay   of rent
I am aware of that 
Perfect liberty I said to her that we did not want her vote as I was sure Mr Crawford had plenty of votes
She did not tell me she was going to vote for the minister
I did not know she was going to do that
I told her if she was to vote for the factor not to go out
Yes
I asked her not to come
No
I never mentioned any other soul upon earth
Yes
The good people of this district knowing the interest I take in the  class from which I sprang elected me a delegate and sent for me to come  here from England
But I am also a delegate appointed by the natives of  Sutherland in Canada New Zealand Australia Queensland and Ceylon  to represent them before this Commission when it visited Sutherland
Having regard to your time now I shall defer making any observations  that I had to make to another occasion when I hope I shall have the pleasure of meeting you in another district and of submitting myself to any examination the members may wish
Very likely in Inverness
No but I represent two districts Tongue proper and what remains of Strathnaver Invernaverthat is a piece of land a short distance above the hotel
I was appointed delegate for Strathnaver and in the first place I shall deal with Strathnaver and if you should wish to put any questions to me I shall try to answer them
After that I shall deal with Tongue as their case is quite different
The complaint of oppression which I have to make as far as Tongue is concerned is not against the present or the late factor but against the loch laws some imaginary laws we know nothing about
The people of Strathnaver are in great need of more land and they are greatly in need of more pasturage
The best of the grazings or common is now under sand and the fifteen crofters with their cattle are settled on a miserable fringe of land
Mr Horsburgh the late factor when the Borgie lease was being renewed took it upon himself to deprive the crofters of Invernaver at Borgie of their hill pasture and added it to Borgie sheep farm
The people of Invernaver remonstrated with himthis is more than thirty years agosaying they would have to complain to the Duke
He answered that they might go over the rocks for all he cared and that he would show the people that he was there as factor
There is an old man here who was present when these words were usedold John Munro
The people also complain that they are closed in on every side while two sheep farmers have a run of forty miles in one direction
The people have petitioned his Grace twice for more landthe first time being when the grazing ground was given to Borgie farm
The late Mr Loch in answering the petition  wrote that Mr Crawford the factor said it would spoil Borgie farm
Now if it spoiled Borgie farm to part with that land to the poor people why was it taken from them first and given to Borgie
The people petitioned again last year when Auchnaburin was out of lease but the officials did not condescend to reply to the petition
The people complain also that they are fined for cutting divots on the sheep farm their own land being so poor that what is low of it is covered with sand
Their upper pasture is something like a human being covered with smallpoxall over with rocks in every direction
The average rental is  s
The crofters are prepared to take as much land off Auchnaburin farm as they have at present and to pay the same rent as they do for their crofts which is more than the sheep farmer pays for what he has
The average acreage is   acres per croft
The whole crofts in Invernaver are cultivated  the whole of the land the crofters hold is cultivated with the exception of about five acres
Again the mountain pasture which I have describedrocks and cliffsis a mile and a half by three quarters of a mile and the general average of cattle is two cattle and following which means perhaps a heifera calf one horse and five sheep
In this district there is only one pauper
A great complaint of the people also is in relation to the school but I shall leave the school for the present and shall dwell upon the amount of land in Strathnaver and as I know it well and wrought it and examined it I am very glad to know that your lordship is to go up the strath
You will not see the whole of the land of Strathnaver
I heard you asking why the people were turned out a jargon was got up at the time that the people were lazy
I wish to give the Commission every honour and shall bow to your Lordships ruling but as I have visited the place and formed an opinion I thought I might tell your Lordship the result of my examinations so that it might throw a little light upon the subject
I have placed the Invernaver case before you
Then I shall go on to Tongue
Tongue proper is supposed in this part of the country to contain the most comfortable class of tenants we have
There is a law there which applies to all his Graces estate in this part of the country and it stops all improvements
A son if he assists his parents and spends his time and his labour in improving the croft under these land laws the moment his father dies and he comes into the croft there is a rise of rental
I can instance one case here and another in Tongue
On entering Tongue by the Thurso road one is at once struck by a pretty line of villalike cottages on Brae Tongue
The first that catches the eye is a long white slated house with large slated shop and stabling which were occupied by the late Mr George Mackenzie merchant
More than threefourths of that lot was trenched and drained at his own expense
Nor did the house shops outbuildings or dykes ever cost the Duke one sixpence although they cost poor Mr Mackenzie several hundred pounds
After his death one of his sons applied to get his name entered as tenant
He could not get it unless he paid  s of a rise of rent
The young man thought this a great hardship that he should have to pay the Duke for the improvement his father made for if his father had left the lot as he got it it would not have been worth   a year instead of  What is the consequence
The widow now has only a room closet and garrets with her married daughter who may have any day to join her husband in America
The widows sons are the eldest in Manitoba and the other in Queensland
Both left about twelve months ago
The father only died four years ago
Another man has got the rest of the premises and lot for the sum asked of the son
We will now go to the extreme end of Tongue village
There we will see a large lot on a beautiful flat and we will probably consider this crofter very fortunate
But on making inquiry we find that there are two and that the one who ought to be the real crofter has only onethird of the lot namely the widow of James Mackay
The whole of this lot was made by her father brother and her first husband William Mackintosh during his lifetime
During her first widowhood and part of her second husbands time this lot was shared equally between them and her brother
Her brother went to Australia about twenty years ago
She naturally expected to get the lot and applied for it but no another tenant got twothirds while she had to be content with onethird
And the worst of the matter is that neither she nor her husband ever owed a penny of rent
Her aged mother lived in the house occupied by her brother which had only two rooms
When her mother died the factor ordered her to give up possession of the house which was found for her and when she refused to do so as she wished her married daughter to live there she was summoned out of it legally
But instead of their taking legal steps for the removal of her furniture the ground officer was sent with assistance and broke open the door and took possession of the houses built a wall across the centre cut out another door gave one room to her married daughter and turned the other into a house for paupers
The houses trenching and draining of this lot never cost the Duke a farthing
My reason for instancing this case is to prove that instead of the people wishing to have the lots subdivided in certain cases it is the Duke who subdivides the lots and not the people
The people are entirely against the subdivision of the lots
In other districts I know of no case of voluntary subdivision
Bythebye a large drain was cut across the brow of the hill above the Kirkebol lots which cost the Duke something and the widow something too as it greatly assisted to destroy their lot
For instancing these two cases of oppression I ask no guarantee from Mr Purves as I believe that neither Duke nor factor dare take these poor widows lives and they cannot do them more injury than they have done
Then there are two crofts adjoining Tongue woods the one on the Brae Tongue side and the other on the Rhi Tongue side
Both had to do away with their sheep because they were going into the woods which were not properly fenced
These tenants had a right to keep thirty sheep each
They were not ordered to part with them but they were continually getting letters from the factor
I have other complaints but I shall not trouble you with them just now
Only I should wish to say as to the district which we represent that what the people want in general is more land
The Farm of Ribigill adjoining is suitable to have eight crofts and I have not the slightest doubt but that it would pay his Grace and at the same time keep down this cry of poverty because Ribigill farm alone gives more employment than any other works about there
As far as his Grace is concerned and according to the people here any office it does not matter what it is from gamekeeper to contractorno man belonging to this place or native or inhabitant of Tongue proper or about it can get any position not even gamekeeper under his Grace no native get into any position under his Grace except perhaps a common daylabourer
It has been asked whether the people are industrious
I say the people are industrious and I was sorry to notice that the Rev
Mr MNeil did not say directly that they were
The people would work if they had the work to do
They will walk many a mile to work if they can get it and I am sure at the present time I am justified in saying that most of the people in this church who are not employed would walk three or four miles to employment if they could get it
Thirteen years
Yes
It was publicly intimated and a large section of the church was occupied
I have
I have
Yes
I do as far as my information goes
No of Rossshire
Well it has been reanimated and revived but it has been slumbering in our minds for years
We required no one from the outside to come and agitate us upon this question
Yes but it is more common among the young who go south and mingle with the people in the south and labour there
Our young men go there for a season and some of them even go across the Atlantic
They get no work or employment here
There are eight or a dozen young men heads of families who crossed the Atlantic and worked there for a season and then came home
Very strong
Some of those young men have gone across the Atlantic
One of them a man who had learned his trade and had a good knowledge of building extended his hand and said he had never earned on the Dukes estate more than s d and that was for putting in a grate into a public school
There is no work here
No prospect
It does to a very great deal
It does and there is this in it I have heard some of the other delegates refer to itlast year a good deal of our corn was threshed and it was blown over the rocks
A numerously signed petition was prepared in the parish of Farr and sent to his Grace
It was sent to Dunrobin where it was understood the Duke was and we never got any acknowledgement of it
No one connected with his Grace had the grace to acknowledge receipt of the petition
The petition was sent away in October last
It was forwarded at that time and we thought it would be taken into consideration at the rent collection in November
That is the fact  all that we are allowed is to gaze with admiration on the retreating wheels of his  carriage when he is going away
Last year was an exception
He spent three days here at that time an unprecedented thing in the Tongue management
He did more freely than he was ever known to come before
Much appreciated and it was looked upon as perhaps a sign of good times coming
I have
Yes
I have
The accounts of old men living in Aird and in the different townships about are more graphic and vivid and harrowing than anything that has ever been written on the subject
Credible men whose word one would take for anything
I see nothing
My belief is that it would be the very opposite
Yes
Yes and also Mr Cumming and others
Decidedly not
They dont consider their present rents high but really although they got the crofts for nothing what good would it do them
There are  crofters who pay a rental of  s d
Divide that among the whole and you have an average rent of  s d
Now how much land can they have for that  It is nothing one way or another it would not keep them a couple of months
Decidedly above three months in the year during the other nine months they would die
That is a general thing I believe
more than ten times to induce her to vote in a particular direction
She got weak and trembled because the loss of the factors favour was the loss of house and home but before the close of the poll she felt better and was able to come out
It is very much in the territorial interest
Mr Crawford the factor is chairman
Five Mr Purves Mr Sellar Rev
Mr Munro Strathy and myself
It is all the territorial interest and so it is at the Parochial Board it is all the territorial interest that is represented
Of course whatever interest our friends the sheepfarmers have in education our children get the benefit of it
But they are absent the most of the year and their interest is rather to keep down the rates and we suffer
But I should complete what I had to say about widow Murray
This happened in the election of  Had they succeeded ia preventing that woman coining out they would have excluded me from the School Board
When the state of the poll was declared well might Mr Purves say with a cynical smile  This is the result of compulsory educationputting a fools cap upon all the proceedings
I dont object to canvassing in a reasonable way but the canvassing in this case was abusing the Dukes influence to suppress the liberties of the people
By the next election the woman got a summons of ejection
She had paid her rent and after paying her rent and after the factor received it she still was ejected cut of her lot and her lot was given to another and this was the case of an aged woman upwards of eighty
The community who knew the circumstances looked upon that as the following out of the threat at the previous election
This took place upon the eve of the following election
Between the nomination and the election day she was evicted and the lot given to another
It is fair to say of Mr Crawford that he said he did not authorise the ground officer to go and my reply to that was that I did not say who authorised him but that the ground officer himself said Mr Crawford authorised him and the intimidation was all the same as he went there as his masters servant
They looked upon me as the cause of her losing her croft and I wrote Sir Arnold perhaps more earnestly than I should have done for my own matter and stated that this woman had been paying rent for sixty years on his Graces estate and that she was not a single sixpence in arrears
She had her son and daughter in beside her besides her daughterinlaw and some seven or eight orphans  and on taking the case into consideration Sir Arnold allowed her to remain and she will be there I hope until she dies
That is the case
I know nothing between myself and the Dukes representative here but that I am not simpleminded enough to say  No when he chooses to say  No and  Yes when he chooses to say  Yes
I know of nothing more against me
I know that people are in fear and terror and I only hope that the meeting of this Commission will enable them to assert their independence
They have a feeling of being cowed down and trampled upon
I may mention that the factor who is chairman and clerk to the School Board got a present of some  or  The other gentleman besides me who was obnoxious Mr Mackay Skelpick opposed that
I did not oppose it but I was understood to sympathise with Mr Mackays view and the first thing done as soon as the new board was elected was to vote  to the factor as clerk to the School Board
I did not oppose it
I said I saw the reasonableness of it and that I would not do the work for the money
But by the next meeting of the board I saw in the Code that it was illegal to give any of the ratepayers money to a member of the board and I then dissented
I did not object
But Mr Crawford hearing that and that others were opposed to it accepted the money and returned thanks for it and I did not object to it
But at the next meeting I had a copy of the Code where it was stated that it was illegal to give any of the ratepayers money to a member of the board
Mr Crawford then declined to accept it and returned the money
Yes and he occupies the same positions in connection with the Parochial Board
Mr Crawford is chairman and the ground officer is a member also
The landed interest comes in so that the only thing any other person can do is simply to object
Mr Macdougall Inspector of poor and public teacher
No but the woman who had voted and who had been accused of not voting rightnot voting as she had promised went to him and said  Do you not remember how I voted could you bring evidence to show how I voted
She was illiterate and required his assistance to enable her to vote
I was thirtyfive years a builder carrying on slater work and carpenter work
Yes
Yes and Dalchurn and Blundy which only contain thirteen crofters altogether
They have been townships since before my recollection but only occupied by one tenantone tenant in each of them
They were brought from the heights of the strath in order to make way for extending sheep farms at two or three different times till at last they got their farm to their own mind and put all the people to the breadth of the seashore where they are in danger of losing their stock and even their children over the rocks
The subdivision went one again in  There were then six crofters
Again in  there were other six put in and lately by the present factor there was one lot divided into two making thirteen altogether
It is about eighteen years since the last lot was divided
He had the half of a croft in Dalcharn the next township and he was turned out by the present factor for a soninlaw of the ground officer and the factor gave him a croft in Blandy
The last great increase was in  but I am not quite sure of the date because an old man is apt to get rusty and my memory would require to be assisted
There were a great many built in  more than the people required and far more than their means could bear
The most of those who were tenants at that time are in their graves now and went to their graves insolvent
Other people have built houses and have never got a thing from the Duke for them but the bare rent
In
They were inhabited by the people at that time but in a few years afterwards some of the people emigrated to America and the houses were valued by the Dukes factor and some of the people had to pay   for the houses for which they had never got a farthing from the Duke  others were valued at   and so on
They are still standing
Yes
I did not mean that they were too good for the people but that the people would have done with less accommodation the houses were too good for their means
Yes
Yes he only gave the roof
They only got planted timber which is now gone away this long time
It was not foreign timber but planted timber from Inverness and this place
At that time mostIy except one or two houses they were covered with divots and thatch
A few people who were getting better up in the world by having good dutiful sons got their houses slated
They were not able to do that themselves but it was done through their family coming up and being by good example and training dutiful sons who helped their parents to slate their houses
Most of the houses however are still under thatch and many a drop the people have upon their head too
No they are not all the same size
First it was my father who got the croft and there is a map in the Dukes Tongue office which will show how much arable land there was in the croft at that time
I think there would not be two acres of arable land altogether when I got it
I improved the lot and made it one piece
The factor gave me a piece of very bad ground se steep that I could not work it and I promised that I would improve part of it and I improved twelve acres of new ground between the old lot and the new one
Yes I have fully thatabout fourteen
 s d
No we have not
We have hill pasture
We have about six square miles of heather pasturenothing but heather which is divided between  crofters
We have double the number of the cattle upon it for the number of crofters and it is of no avail to us for that reason
Yes we do
It is eight sheep I have myself
I keep three cows
May be a calf and stirk  that is all I have just now
Two horses because the ground I have is so steep that I require a good pair of horses to work it but they are idle with me a great part of the year
Since
Yes four or five times by some trifles at one time s at another time and s at another time
About fortyfour years
Yes as far as my recollection serves me
No not from that present sum
Yes
I have been improving the ground and I built a mill for the tenants of which I have only had the benefit as one of the tenants
I was promised many a thing when I built it but never got it
I laid out  upon the new ground and buildings which left my rent without altering
I do not count the value of my labour at all but the labour of those who did the work whom I paid with money
Every farthing I say between labour and timber and slate and lime and smithy expenses upon these  improvementsaltogether clear and clean cash
For substantial improvementswhat I have paid to tradesmen and labourers for building dykes making drains trenching and smithy expenses
I was promised by the late Duke that I would get a lease but I never got it and that led me to make these improvements more than I would otherwise have done
I petitioned the Duke last year to give me some compensation for all this money being an old man and my family being taken away by death except one daughter who is a widow and I cannot work a stroke but the factors were putting in things which were not true and spoiled the thing upon me altogether I was wanting some compensation while I was alive which would not be long but I did not get anything and I was blaming the factor for the whole the Duke being a childish fellow himself
He is a good man but very childish and takes factors to be infallible and will not come to investigate the case between the factor and his tenants
In one point to our present factor but in other things to his predecessors
But I may say he is the worst we have ever had
I may say that distinctly and I have many a reason for saying it
I cannot follow you in these figures because my father was thrown out of a good place into a croft of an acre and a half and had not means to give me education
He had to put me to herding and all the education I ever got was what I taught myself when herding
I would expect that
A good deal for keeping it in order
Those new things cost me as much as the rent and I am only keeping them up for the Duke
Yes with no use for them only for six weeks when laying down the crop but I would require to leave the place barren unless I had the horses
They are generally poor but according to Providence some of them will be in better circumstance than others
Some of them by having large families and dutiful sons get better on than others but that is not from the land
No that is the case with the three townships I represent and mostly in the whole district of Tongue it applies to the whole district of Tongue what I say
I would not get the rent I am paying for it
No it is bad ground
Sometimes I cannot get out of it the seed I put in
I cannot gather manure and I had to buy artificial manure and I was prohibited taking seaware by the factor and then I could not work at all
I was foolish and looked for better days and wished to be in the place that my father lived in
But I see myself a very foolish man today
He has gained by it because I improved his estate
It is worth more money for grazing but where would my crop be
I do not see that I would get any one to take it at all because they know the place to be so bad that they would not take it that is my real opinion
By measuring the land and drains and fences
I kept an account but I cannot say that I could gather it together now
But the very place will make it out the ground will show for itself
I do not mean anything I expended myself
Yes I never put d upon my own labour
I only kept account of the money I paid out not upon anything I have done myself
Trenching making drains building fences and houses and smithy expenses
It was this there were some parts where the gravel being so hard I had to pay more smithy expenses for picks and things than for the rood of ordinary trenchingowing to the ground being naturally stiff and hard
But the whole of the ground was not that
I think you would not expect I would include that
I have a house of two rooms and a little garret a good kitchen a carpenters shop stable byre and a good large barn and a good outer house for keeping timber in which I have no use for just now but only it cost me money
All the houses are good enough because I am a mason myself
Not outside
Slated the barn stable shop and byre are all slated
I did it was by my orders it was done
I was maybe only as one hand or providing things for the workmen
I had other masons doing it
Only for the dwelling house which is about  feet long by  broad
I only got the roof of the dwelling house I never got an inch for the other houses
No
Yes and I have never got a grain of lime from the factor and only now and then I would get that same
There are a few of them of the same sortmost of them are but they do not build those additions for the steading as I did
I had money about my hand and did this being foolish and I am at last left in the lurch
The Duke has the house and I am without money and without house when he likes to evict me
No not in my memory they were only huddled in with us not evicted
I am one of three delegates from the middle district of the parish of Tongue one of whom you have already heard and another of whom met with an accident this morning and is not able to be here
The one who is not able to be here sent me a statement which he had prepared to read before the Commission
He met with an accident this morning He handed me this paper produces paper
It is not my statement
It is both
I was appointed delegate at a meeting held in the Free Church on Wednesday th June  by the crofters of Coldbacke and RhiTongue
In the district I represent there are eleven crofters who  hold from one to five acres of arable land and pay from s to  between rent and taxes
Their common pasture is Cnocand Fhreiceadain Sentinel Hill
We want revaluation of our lots larger holdings security against evictions and compensation for unexhausted improvements
There are
Yes
It is
I cannot answer the question with that exactness I should like but I know that some of them are descendants of those who were evicted from Ribigill to make room for sheep
To the west of the district about four or five miles
Not quite
I think so that is my opinion
Only three and a half years
They are
It is my impression that they are high
 am not aware
I know that the proprietor has improved but I am not sure that it was in connection with the raising of the rents and I rather think not
He has given encouragement to them to build better houses
There is a road through to Coulbackiea county road
I am not aware
Generally speaking the people themselves drain and fence and trench their lots
No
There is time given to themat least in some cases
Not within my district
No they are better than the houses in the surrounding districts
They are
Some of them perhaps I should say most of them
Two rooms and a closet
Yes
Quite so that is the general statement made by the people themselves at a meeting we had at which I took down their statement
The proprietor did give some assistance
Yes
They have said so to me
From an earlier period
None whatever
I think so I am sure it would
I have to say that I know there are loud complaints that there is no encouragement given to the young people to stay at home and to get lots to work nor is there much encouragement given to those who do stay at home to seek employment
My meaning is that the young and ablebodied men have to leave the country during the larger half of the year to seek employment far from their homes
Consequently much of what they earn away from home is spent away from home and they do not therefore benefit their families by their earnings as they might otherwise do if they were enabled to earn their bread at home
I am not
Tyree
I may say I come from Skye but I happen to have been born in Tyree
I do
I think so
No not as far as I know
Yes
They are when they are at home but most of the people are away just now earning daily bread in the rest of the country
During the winter season when they are at home a good deal could be done in the way of giving them employment but I am sorry to say there is little being done
I do think so and I think it is a thing our young men are looking forit is what they would like
I believe it is not I believe they are warmly attached to their native country
It is
No provided the proprietor gave new land to the young men who asked for it
I think so
Very quiet very peaceable very intelligent and very orderly
Only one
At Tongue village
Not one so far as I am aware
I do I know that it is very difficult during the winter season especially to prosecute any kind of fishing
There is and I think the want of harbour accommodation is one of the great drawbacks of this coast
Often I know that his attention has been directed frequently to it
That is what I cannot tell
No
I do and also of Lewis and of the islands
In the district which I represent I think they are higher
It is difficult for one to speak for the whole island
I did not think of comparing them but I know Skye pretty well and Lewis and I know that Coulbackie and Scullourie are more highly rented than some places I could mention on those islands
They say so to me and I see no reason to doubt them
Some of them do work when they can get it
Not so wet
It is
Yes
Yes
Yes I do
It depends upon the nature of the soil
If there was very good soil of course they could live on it without any hill pasture
It is
It should
Some timber and slate until such time as they could relieve him and also some lime
The statement which I handed in refers not so much to the present as to the past
To be sure not
Yes and the fact is many of them do go abroad
Certainly not
I was making general statements
I know young men from this country have succeeded very well elsewhere
I have met with them in the south as well as in other parts of the country and I know that they do very well
Never
No I could expand upon it
Eight years
It was the residence once of the Mackays of Bighouse
They had a pump in the garden and they got water from the river also
No
Yes except when there was an overflow
When there is no overflow we have to dig wells for ourselves like the people of old
I am quite sure of it at times
No but there are men here who have seen it who can testify to it
Not in that place
Any well that is there the water is inferior and not near that place at all

Nine years
No
Yes
Yes
There is a piece of round of eight or nine acres just in front of my house that I was promised verbally by the factor would be reclaimed but that has not been done yet
Yes
No
I was to pay s d an acre besides interest on what was to be laid out
Yes and I have reminded the factor of it two or three times since
Yes I expended close on  on building
I have not built a dwelling house but I have built all the offices and had the factors hand of writing for timber for the offices
No lime but I had the factors writing for the rough timber for the offices which was never fulfilled and I had to go and buy timber at a cost of  to 
No
There was no statement about that I was only a tenant at will
Well I would not do it today
Not the least but then there is no security and that leaves matters that the tenants have no encouragement to improve
No and I have only one single room for a dwelling
I built a house seventyfour feet long of stone and lime and timber and also shed covers
For a byre barn stable and a room to dwell in
No
I didnt suppose I would get a lease
That is what I understood in my own mind
Every one in the locality
There is no land for the rest to reclaim in the position they are in just now
Some of them would
Of course they would
There are meadow lands where there are hundreds of bolls of meal lying in the soil
Yes
Grass
I have nothing special to say except that I will answer any questions that may be asked
Yessince the country road went by there
I cannot account for it unless they were crossing down at the foot of the river at Bighouse
They cross there still when the sea is out and there is no flood
Yes
There is that is the way the old road led before the county road was made
I suppose it would be about that time
There was no need of it before as there was no road there
Yes
A halfpenny for a foot passenger
A pony and cart l  d  but for a horse passing fifteen hands d
No it is not stopped but a horse with a load cannot go there a horse with an empty cart could go there
Yes
Not to my knowledge
About six feet at this time of the year
Yes
I never heard of any difficulty at all
Not to my knowledge but I suppose the matter has been considered at a meeting of the Road Trustees since a year or two ago but still we are without a bridge
I cannot say
As far as my knowledge goes the Road Trustees have nothing to do with it it is the proprietor as far as I understand
The assessment
The roads are contracted for by contractors who repair them
There are Road Trustees in the county who have management of these roads and who are elected by the ratepayers
Thank you my Lord
Fourteen
During this dry summer almost every second day we are wanting water
I do not draw my water from that spring
Yes
Yes
I just went round the crofters and every one of them told me
There are two in the township about  and I pay  all the rest pay from   to 
It keeps me from buying much but I have no family
A croft rented at from   to 
About that
Yes
No but they go to the east coast fishing
Yes and if there was a harbour at Port Skerra it would benefit Melvich also because the men at the seacoast are I believe all fishing
I could not answer that question
Mr Crawford at Tongue
John Mackay
They have represented it to the ground officer I know
That they would get the necessary supply of water
I could not say
He did not
I could not say
No
Yes
The people understood they would get the necessary supply of water from the same well
They expected that they would get their supply by a pipe that let it flow out on the same level with the pipe that leads to the sheep farmers residence
The pipe which leads to the sheep farmers residence is at the bottom of the cistern and the pipe that lets the overflow out is up near the brink
As far as I know any time that they spoke to the ground officer about it he answered in such a way that they expected to get what they wanted
No I was not personally there but I have heard what he said
Yes in general they are
From twelve to twenty
Fortyfour
Only one who pays rent and he has a few sheep
No I have no land at all I am living at the east side of Strathy Point and some old people wanted me to give information about the poor circumstances they were in
I was worse than a crofter I was a cottar a slave completely
To tell how poor they were
According to my judgment they are the poorest people under the Duke of Sutherland
Strathy Point is two miles in length on one side and three upon the other
The westerly wind blows upon it the northwest wind blows upon it the north wind blows upon it the northeast wind blows upon it and when a storm comes it blasts the croft and the people have no meat for the cattle or for themselves
Really it beats me to make that out I was only desired to state these peoples poverty and I am doing so
The place is allotted on both sides and there is pasture between the two lots and they have each of them a few sheep but they must have them in the house all night and out on the hill all day
Anything they have between cattle and sheep they keep on the hill during the day until eleven oclock at night
They have no pasture at all and the arable ground they have if you go there today you would see on it as bonnie a crop as there is in the country but if a storm comes on in a fortnight perhaps it might be blasted so as to be of no use
Very little it destroyed the crop he put in the ground
The people are in perfect poverty
They are something kind towards one another and when they see one destitute a small help what be given by the neighbours but it came to that state last year that they had to raise a collection in the Free Church to assist the poverty of the people
Blasted with the storm
No and I have been there thirty years
I came there from Ribigill
Yes an acre and a half from Mr Mitchell and I was paying  s
I had to pay not money but seventy days laboura shilling a day during the time the rent was to pay
Yes
By working at Caithness in the quarries and I was so unfortunate that one day I was working in the quarry a large flag which was supposed to be half a ton in weight fell upon me and made me useless to this day so that I have never won a penny since then
Give them more pasture for their cattle and more landland that would suit for cropping
At present they may have a crop one year but they will not get three years crop on it
It ought to be so done never a man should be put there at all
It is just a wild nasty place
There might be some six or seven and they might live comfortably but now there are beyond sixty
There are seven or eight people living in their goodmothers and goodfathers raising their family
Another thing is that you cannot see a lassie or a boy of from seven to ten years of age but must go away herding when they ought to be at school
They go to herd in Caithness and Strath Halladale or wherever they can get work
Yes from  to s
Yes they do that
That is a thing I did not ask them I am just a poor man amongst them
Yes just crowded like my fingers
I could not say I did not count I did not think it would better me
I only came to favour the people
There is a town holding three tenants in the place and the place might be a kind of living to one in a good year if the crop were got in
But there are three on it and they cannot get a right to their houses and they have to carry everything upon their back
In my opinion these three ought to be taken out and placed somewhere else and their places given to the rest of the crofters for pasture for their sheep or cattle but I have no business with it
In Strathnaver
I left when young and came to Strathy Point when the sheep commenced
Yes I was very nearly drowned that day 
Yes
I will remember it as long as I live
I got a terrible fright
It would be a very hard heart but would mourn to see the circumstances of the people that day
He would be a very cruel man who would not mourn for the people
If you were going up the strath now you would see on both sides of it the places where the towns were you would see a mile or half a mile between every town there were four or five families in each of these towns and bonnie haughs between the towns and hill pasture for miles as far as they could wish to go
The people had plenty of flocks of goats sheep horses and cattle and they were living happy
 The wood has been taken off the crofters houses and it was sent to Altnaharra for a house of revelry and drunkenness
The manse which the godly ministers of old occupied is now occupied by a fox hunter and his study is the dog kennel
The house which yourself had and the great big stone at which you were wont to pray the crow now builds its nest upon the top of it
Now I consider at that time the Gospel was preached at both ends of Strathnaver and in the middle of the strath and in several other towns the elders and those who were taking to themselves to be following the means of grace were keeping a meeting once a fortnighta prayer meeting amongst themselves and there were plenty gathering so that the houses would be full
I hope not
 Wont you wake up Sellar is burning at a place called Rhistog
We got such a fright that we started out of bed and ran down to the river because there was a friend of ours living upon the other side and we wished to go there for protection
I took my brother on my back and through the river I went and the water was that deep that when it came up upon his back he commenced crying and shaking himself upon my back and I fell and he gripped round about my neck and I could not rise nor move
We were both greeting and took a fright that we would be drowned
There was a poor woman coming with her family up the strath and she saw us and jumped into the river and swept us out of it
No I did not
I was naked when I went to the river and when they took me out of it my friends took such care of me that they dried me and put me into a bed
About eleven years of age
Three years of age
Oh 
yes yes
All from the river Owenmalloch and another river coming into Strathnaver on the east side down to Dunvedan Burn
That is said but I cannot say I saw nothing because I was in bed
Yes
You would have pitied them tumbling on the ground and greeting and tearing the ground with their hands
Any softminded person would have pitied them
I cannot give the number but yon was the first removal in Strathnaver
We will give you  or  out of that and move the people out of the place and give the money to you all at once and the people were removed
Sellar got it but in five years time we had a second removal
I believe Sellar
I was in Caithness herding at the time but I suppose it was just Sellar who got it
What would I do there
Nothing at all I want nothing but raiment and daily bread if the Lord provide that for me
I never heard any cause for it
No I never did no reasonable or lawful cause about it at all
Yes
Yes
Yes
Because we were weak and young and they were sure we would sleep to nine or ten oclock when they would be back again
My father was back before I was ten minutes out of the river
About a mile and a half to the place called Wood of Skail which was an uncultivated piece of ground until then
It was a place that never was laboured before
No he had to build his house with feal and no stone at all
No
Nothing in the world
Five years when he got a second removal
To Strathy Point to the worst place there is in the district
Yes
About ten miles
Yes
I have a written statement which embraces the grievances between Strathy and Armadale
I acted as secretary for five townships
Not exactly but I will be able to answer any questions
There are crofters from the several townships to speak for themselves 
Yes
I have acted as secretary for the people and prepared these statements in the presence of the crofters themselves and that is how the writing is all in the same hand
No it was not necessary
We assembled in Strathy Free Church and the delegates drew up the statement there
I dont mean to say the whole of them but a good majority of them
They came to a meeting in the Free Church and appointed delegates
I did for the whole district
There is a want of hill pasture and of more arable ground
Well the rents are not perhaps excessive but when you consider the small size of the holdings they are
The rents would not be excessive supposing we had two or three crofts at the present rate
Exactly so
A croft of about  acre is too small at merely a nominal rent
There are no cases of rackrenting
It includes both
We want more arable land to give us a holding of ten or fifteen acres and we want also a sufficient amount of hill pasture to enable us to keep some stock
Of hill pasture we may say we have nothing it is of inferior qualitythe worst patches were given to us because they were of no other use in the world
No but we want to migrate to the strath our forefathers had  and some of us could then remain in the several townships by getting the neighbouring crofts along with our own
But the majority of them would require to migrate
Certainly
Well no they would require some help because they are at present in poverty and it could not be expected that they should be able
They are verging on pauperism the most of them
The most of them I should say are verging on poverty they have no money at their disposal
They may be able to get help from the south and some go elsewhere to earn money but most of them have no money at their disposal and could not build houses all at once
No I think not
Certainly
They would require more stock they have scarcely any stock at all in sheep in these townships
Yes
Well with respect to stock some of them might be able to put on about thirty sheep each and I think if they got the hill pasture the whole of them might in a few years be able to stock it some of them to do it might require help from Government but we have had to contend with difficulties in the past and I think we would be able to do it again and stock the land ourselves
No
Yes
Perhaps they might do it in conjunction with the large sheep farmer in the vicinity provided there is one
The large sheep farmer might do one half and they might do the other
There would be no occasion if there was no tacksman in the vicinity
Yes
Not at once
Because they are people with whom the fates will have to bargain before they are annihilated or succumb to bad usage
No twenty years ago they were much the same I think
Of course there is a downward tendency so far as the value of the crofts themselves is concerned because the land is deteriorating and they dont raise the crops they did at that time
Of late years there has been more employment in the shape of making roads to villages which have for seventy years had to do without them and to which the people had to carry their meal and everything on their back a distance of two or three miles
Of late years roads have been made and consequently some of the men have got employment
The reclaiming of such farms as Ribigill and Kildonan has given employment to some of the people in the district
Certainly it has last year at any rate
But their crofts dont produce the same amount as they did formerly and it is only a limited number of people who are employed on the roadsnothing at all to the large population of the several townships only a few men here and there perhaps twenty or so
That is true
Yes I have heard it said it is the most suitable place between Cape Wrath and Dunnet Head
I have been told that
Yes
Yes and be able in a short time to build better boats
They cannot compete with the east coast fishermen now owing to the small size of their boats and if they could prosecute the fishing at home they could provide themselves with better boats so as to compete with the east coast fishermen
I cannot say
Several times
I think so and the grievances also which the people had to endure owing to the want of it
There is a man present with a written statement who will tell these grievances
Yes
Yes
Certainly
Certainly it is the only way to remedy the present condition of things I think
I dont know I am sure
I think so it is such a wide place
He is not alive
Yes I am at present
My mother
I am a student as well
Yes
St Andrews
I am not sure
I have
Not any written statement
I have to state on behalf of the people that they complain of the smallness of their lots the uncertainty of tenure and that they are subject to annoyances if they happen to offend any official
Yes
They also complain of lack of harbour accommodation which shuts up the district from intercourse with other parts of the empire
That is true of the whole coast as well as to the district of Melness
The people are so located that in the greater number of cases their lots cannot be extended unless twothirds or at least onethird of them were removed so as to make room for the remainder to be somewhat comfortable
They are also subject to fines not by the Sheriff or according to the laws of the empire but according to estate laws
If a man receives a lodger into his househis soninlaw or his daughter in lawhe is subject to a fine and that fine in some instances if not in all gradually finds its way into his rent and becomes an increase of rent
More and James Munroold men between seventy and eighty years of age interest on the capital labour and money which they had laid out upon the ground had to be paid
These are only specimens of what has created a feeling of insecurity which prevents the people from exerting themselves in any case when it is possible to do so
It prevents them from making an effort to improve their condition and make themselves more comfortable
The fact is that there is such a spirit of dissatisfaction and such a sense of insecurity gone abroad that it may become dangerous on the part of the Government if they dont do something to ameliorate the condition of the people
The people feel that they have no country that they have no right
If they are known to have a gun or if they are known to transgress any of what are called the byelaws of the estate there are a dozen ways which cannot be formulated in which their condition is made intolerable and it is tantamount to punishment to them
There is not a bit of ground which a countryman can call his own or build a bothy on from the top of Kilbreck down to the sands of Naver
And that is a very unhappy condition for the whole of the people to be in
There are so far as I can make out between  and  people in the Reay countrythat is the country of Lord Reay or the Mackay country and all that population I had not an opportunity of very accurately making it outhave only somewhere about onethirteenth part of the Reay country allowed to them or  people and the rest is under sheep under deer under hares under rabbits and under grouse and other unprofitable occupants of the soil
I think it is time on account of all these things for some higher power to interfere
We are in fact under an absolute despotism
It is quite true that the House of Dunrobin in intention at least is a benevolent house
As a rule their crofters are not rackrented but then the agents of his Grace are his hands his eyes his ears and his feet and in their dealings with people they are constantly like a wall of ice between his Grace and his Graces people
And this is not the case in a single instance or with respect to one individual but it has been the case for the last fifty or sixty years
There may be in a locality here and there and in the case of one individual now and again an exception but what I have said describes the district as a whole
Now our Government is a constitutional one
Her Majesty cannot fix a single farthing of rent upon a proprietor of the soil without the consent of the House of Commons it must be done by Act of Parliament
She cannot advertise any of the estates
Well the practical matter is this that we should have some security analagous to occupiers of the soil and subjects that we should have some security analagous to that which proprietors have from the Crown that is the sum and substance of what we want
They were
I am not very sure but it occurred generally speaking between the years  and
I cannot answer that question but I think it was much about the same time the same spirit prevailed upon the two sides of the country
No I cannot answer that question
Yes
The people were infinitely worse off on account of the smallness of the lots
From the district called Strathmore I believe and most of these families found a location at Melness
At a remote day before my day they were divided but not during the last forty or fifty years
The latter principally
They emigrate there is a constant stream of emigration from the locality
All of them
They go south to America to New Zealand and to Australia
Very much
The lots are so small they are scarcely worth fencing in but the houses have made a great advance in the direction of being improved especially since this Commission was appointed 
It strikes me to see so many cottages covered with slate and wood given and a great variety of privileges freely bestowed compared with the grudging manner in which such things were granted before
The latter
I am told his Grace gives timber for the roof and allows the tenant two or three years to pay the slates
They pay the slates in instalments that is the ordinary way
No nor asked nor expected
That an independent party or parties such as a land court or by whatever name it may be called should be intrusted with authority to say whether or not a change was desirable whether it be called an eviction or dividing of one lot into two or whether it be any other change contemplated that so long as the occupant ia a loyal subject and pays his rent he should not be disturbed without some good moral or social cause and that another than the factor should be the judge as to whether the change was desirable or not
That is a mystery to me
They are called the Loch laws and who executes them or what the code is or to what extent they may be strained or extended or contracted is known only to those who put them in force
That is it
That may be graciously allowed if the factor is consulted if the tenant does it without consulting his superiors he is liable to be puuished by a fine 
I think the very reverse and it is rarely or never done with the view of its being the permanent order of things
All along the coast
I have heard seagoing people point out Talmin at Melness as the best and fittest place
It has but the factor put his finger on it and spoiled the whole affair
His Grace expended between  and  on a harbour on the Tougue side of the Kyle at a place called Scullomie
The reason the pier was put there is popularly believed to have been the followingMr Bremner the engineer at Wick had finished building the harbour there and had a great deal of plant on hand and the factor that was wished to have the harbour on the Tongue side and tampered with the engineer so to appoint it
The engineer declined and pointed out Talmin as the best place but the factor told him  Well if you do so I will not advise Mr Loch to purchase your plant for the building of the harbour
This would have been a loss of several hundreds of pounds to the engineer and between that and votingMr Bremner had considerable influence in procuring votes at Wick for the member for the Northern Burghs of the daythey agreed to put the harbour at Scullomie and it has been of no service to the world
No
It is described in what a Scullomie man said to his Grace on one occasion shortly after it was built
His Grace remarked  I hope you will find this harbour of great use to you and to the whole locality and the man not willing to be too rude said Oh yes my Lord its very good for catching sillocks
There is the case of Hugh Maclean Dalnafie West Melness
His daughter married a neighbours son who was a militiaman and he lived with his brotherinlaw
He has since then got a lot which became vacant for himself but the increase of rent which was put on on account of his staying with his fatherinlaw has been continued down to the present date
That is my opinion
Yes an indefinite amount but it is under a large farm
Yes thousands of acres
If they would labour it for a generation it would
Yes
There is this difference that the further one resides from the seacoast the snow is apt to lie longer and to be heavier on the inland portions of the county but a very large part of the ground with that abatement is superior to the fringe of the country occupied by the people
Almost wholly
I am not sure that I see the drift of the question
If you mean that a slice should be taken off one of these large farms and that the remainder would be still fitted for breeding sheep I most certainly think that could be done in most cases
A sheep farm requires a certain amount of low ground along with the high ground
Yes for the crofters would need outrun for their stock as surely as the sheep farmers require it
No in Durness you will get information about that at Kinloch Bervie
No harbour except the one at Scullomie which is of no use until one goes I dont know how fur round Cape Wrath
There is a jetty or something at Rispond but it is not easily taken
A harbour at Talmin would prove a harbour of refuge for any vessel that might be in distress between Cape Wrath and Strathy Point
On the west side of the Kyle of Tongue
It is but although it is very safe when vessels get in it is very difficult to sail out
I cannot give any idea as to that but it would cost much less to make a secure harbour than it cost to make the one at Scullomie
I cannot say they pay up and down between  and  and some possibly may reach close upon 
Yes and some of them may be less than 
Probably about   acres each
I dont suppose it will average  acres
A  crofter would keep a pony and two or sometimes three poor hill cows and perhaps a stirk or two and he might have a setae of sheep or perhaps sometimes as many as thirty
There have been instances of persons who were very careful of their flocks and who have many more sheep than that
We have a very good outrun at Melnessthe best outrun on the whole coast
That is my opinion
I am not sure it was subsequent to the general migration
From other places
On the east side of Loch Hope and in the district called Strathmorethe district of Fresgell up to Inverhope
If I stated that it is not what I intended to state
Very much
Certainly not if there be more than one representative
Most certainly I do
I dont think it
The general feeling so far as I know it is that one representative of the old people is all that ought to be looked forward to as a permanent successor
It is a harsh rule and against the laws of nature and therefore cannot be a good one
I think not
Since  the people are better educated and will emigrate as they in fact do
Sometimes it is
Easy
I dont remember of any case within my knowledge
The people themselves instinctively shrink from more than one family settling down upon one lot
Because it takes them at a disadvantage
For the last twentytwo years
Melness and Erriboll
It is partly in the parish of Tongue and partly in the parish of Durness quoad civilia
No the Erriboll district
Every one that could come out was present so as to deliberate on what was to be done
So far as known to me
It represents my own certainly
I have it is of it I principally spoke
There is
No my memory is somewhat treacherous but so far as known to me it is between  and  acres
It is
Eleven shepherds and a ploughman
I did
All between Kyle Sku and Holstenhill
I referred to the Reay country between Kyle Sku and Holstenhill along the course of the coast on the Sutherland property
It is it is in the Reay district
It is very large I cannot give any idea of its extent
Not that I am aware of
There are one or two superannuated peoplea superannuated shepherd and gamekeeperliving upon it
I cannot condescend upon its extent
It is it is a days journey to go through it
Parts of it but I am not locally acquainted so as to point out the particular districts
It was a forest from time immemorialat least parts of it
Yes there is not a year in which people are not emigrating
All the people of spirit and enterprise leave the country for everything done in Sutherland must be under the eye of the factor and in the interest of Dunrobin
It is the Duke 
the Duke 
the Duke 
There is no room for enterprise or any independent spirit a man cannot trench a rood of ground without asking leave of the ground officer or some such official
All Highland people are
No doubt about that
I see many reasons to the contrarynot to empty our country of its population it would be suicide
I am not aware
I never saw a copy if they are
They are printed on the peoples minds and the people feel them if they cannot understand them
I dont agree with the last clause
I cannot say as I have not perused the lawsI have not seen them
I only know that they produce a feeling of discomfort
They are not reckoned good laws and in many instances they are made to neutralise imperial laws
The most of our people are seagoing people
They have no opportunity at all
They are a most unhappy people in that respect
Everything they export they export at a rate of  or  or  per cent of loss and everything they import they import at an equal loss on their side againthat is it costs that more than in general centres and places where there is access to the markets
I dont know any part of the British coast that is so ill provided with means of communication with the world outside as the district between Cape Wrath and Holstenhill
I dont believe they would
They are quite alive to the pauperising effect of subdividing their crofts
Not now
Yes
The last meeting was on Saturday last
Yes
Yes
I had the first land when I was twentysix years of age
No I was one of those who were put out for sheep pasture
I was in a small bit of house and then I got liberty to build a house on Sourin
I had to leave the place
To where I am yet
Between three and four miles round about it will be more
When I married the rent was s and I took off the roof and made some improvement on it and there was s raised on me
I cannot say about an acre I think
Yes
Yes and there was s raised on me
Yes
A cow and some sheep
I could not say
They were running at large they were merely small things
That is what my wife paid when I came to the house
There was sraised on me
I took off the roof and put on a new one and I improved some of the land and then there was s raised on me
Half a year after I think
It was an old woman and my wife who were in it and it was low rented
But I improved again and as soon as I improved the second time there was s put on again
About two acres I think of hill pasture
Yes
I was in it somewhere between ten and eleven years
None
I could not be sure
I think so
It was  when I got it
There was about an acre of ground and I built houses
There were no houses on it then they were down and I built houses and occupied the ground for some years and then I improved it
I could not say
I think I had about three acres then and I had a fourteen years lease
I think about an acre
Yes
Yes
Yes
I couldnt just say
I think about two or three acres
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Generally two cattle
Two or three sheep too
I did not consider it was high then
Six guineas
Not so many because the pasture was taken from me to a great extent
There is a small portion of the ground yet in peatmoss and bracken but nothing worth
Yes for seven years
When the lease was out and I paid my rent I asked for a lease again
I got the answer that I would get a lease for seven years
I had to take it
I said I had to take it
No doubt I did that I did so
Yes
I had to take it because I had built a house and improved the ground and what could I do
I had nowhere to go to
No
Just so
Another pound was put on
Just the same
Yes
Yes
Yes I heard of that
I cannot it was in a different district from where I stay
No I just heard of them
No but I think they broke some farm utensils  I dont remember of them injuring any cattle
Much the same I think
I would have allowed a little but I think it was increased too much
Yes I would be willing to give what a conscientious man would say it was worth but I would not like to give the rent I was giving before
When I was young and fit to work I could give it but now I am getting old
Yes and I would have put up better houses too
The houses are generally very little worth now since I built them thirty years ago and I liave no lease but hold from year to year
I am sure of it
If they had any security of the property there is no doubt of it and they would have built better houses too
But if you built houses and improved the property the rent was raised and if you didnt pay it you were put away
I think we did but I am not perfectly sure
I think we wanted them to be for fourteen years
I think I got another seven years lease
Always
I cannot say
I was told that the whole place was offered to another big farm to make sheep pasture
I was told by the man who holds the farm that he had an offer of the whole place to add it on to his farm
I did
Well Mr Balfour factor in Shapinshay was there and I understand he was looking at the place I spoke to him as I thought he was a man of consciencehe is dead nowand he asked me what rent I paid
I told him four guineas and he wanted to know how I could live on the place
He just wanted me to describe how I could hold the place and make a living out of it

Yes and I think an excellent man
He was that
 or four guineas I would not wish to ask it for less I would be willing to give what a man of conscience would say it was worth as long as I could
I would
Where would I go
I would remain as long as I could because when I had nothing to give I would have to be supported some way
No
No I could not do that
Well I only have my wife now my children are all awayand I might make a bit of endeavour to live in that way too
Still that would be a good deal
I used to go to the fishing and I used to make shoes and carry on any kind of work but now I am not fit for that and it takes me my whole time to work on the croft
In that way I ask for nothing
Cattle
There are not many of them here now
Just cross breed
I have three
Just crosses
It must be relied on that indeed
I have four head of cattle at the present time
But I must only keep two for this season because we have no crop which is worth
Cruelly bad I think we have just about half what we had last year
Yes owing to this piece of outbreak of hill above us
We drive them to it but it just keeps them alive and no more it is only heather and peat moss
But we buy for them in winter
Yes
Yes
I cannot make any improvement on the place because I have no security
No
It was measured to me for ten and a half acres the whole in a square
There may be about six or seven acres under the plough
We try it as far as possible
I do when I can get any of it
In the mill a short distance from us but I have not ground any for some years
No but I am giving a little to the hens or anything of that sort
Well I think it is that a great many of the young men have left the island because they have no way of stepping into the old people cannot go
Both herring and cod
I remember a great many fishing boats and I had one of them too
A great deal they could have done little with the rents if they had not gone to the fishing
I would not have had so many this year only I had an old cow and I had to keep a young one to fill its place
Yes I have but a yearold just now
The last I sold for  but it was a yearold
I never sold one at two years old
Yes
I intend to work it
Yes
I take another mans and I plough to him again
I could not keep a horse a week
They are better in some cases but I must do with it as I can
Some do and some who have pasture get horses as they are required
Yes
Yes with the hardiest ones
The cross breed of course we must use what we have
They may be powerfuller bigger and stouter sometimes
It depends on its condition
The flesh on it is not great and we have no grass to give it
Maybe about  or  I have sold one at that and I have sold one at 
It is just as we can get another one raised
I have had the one I have just now  about nine years
At six or seven years old
Yes
Fine that but it takes more to feed him
Yes
Just the same
They had another way
They had a yoke on the oxs necka piece of iron round its neck and fastened to the shafts of the cart
I cannot say but I have seen it that way and worked it too
Yes
Some are convenient and some are a long way from them
No we cart them
It is the custom now carrying on the back used to be the practice
Some poor people who have not carts and cannot get them home in spring have to carry them in winter
I get none because I have no road to the seaware
I have none but what I buy and a little dung from the cattle
I drive a little moss from the hill
Not very far
Because there is not much to get and the roads are so wet in winter that I cannot travel to the mill without going on my neighbours land
Not in my district
In the district I was in before they were but not in this district
None now
Yes I was at that trade too once on a time
I think about forty years ago
As far as I understand I do
I do
Yes
No
Just the same I think there are about a dozen or more in the same position
The man told me so
The whole square about us
About a dozen I think
No
I think so
I was employed by some of the big farmers chiefly as a servant
Yes
By the crofters and cottars
I was first elected by the south end and then approved of by the whole
At Mr Peter Muirs the first one in the room belonging to the central schooL
Yes
No
Yes
The chief grievance I can gather from the whole of these meetings is that we have too little land and that what there is of it is too poor and that we want fixity of tenure and compensation
There is also a grievance about the seaweed which is used as manure for the land and another about the kelp
The first I mentioned was that we have too little land
I suppose a crofter to have say  or  acres of good land
Well the disadvantages which the crofter feels is that he requires to buy a horse and cart a plough and harrow and several other implements before he can cultivate even these  or  acres
He has that horse to get and then the croft does not supply onehalf or onethird the work for which he has the material
One horse cannot plough and consequently he has to join with another crofter having about his own dimensions of the farm and the consequence is that it is only every alternate day he can get in the labouring season to go on with his own work
He is idle when his neighbour is at work unless he can get a job from a big farmer or from some one else
This is very well while he is young and strong then he may perhaps find a job but not when he gets old upon this small croft and when his family are all grown up and away they go one by one and the last one has to go because there is nothing for him to live by or to clothe him perhaps not even so much bread as will be food enough from so small a lot of land
The consequence is that the old man as long as he is able must labour away at his small croft and when he is entirely failed he must give it up to the proprietor and he has no chance now except indeed he calls upon the Parochial Board for relief whereas had he a few acres more he could have retained a son and perhaps a daughter along with him had there been anything for food and clothes for them
He applies to the Parochial Board and they send him to the poorhouse and he gets board for himself and his wife
In this way he is a burden upon the parish but if he had only a little more land his son and daughter might keep the thing going and the public at large and the man himself would be much better
That is all I shall say about the man who has a small croft of good land
But there are other crofters who have poor land
That mainly consists of heath reclaimed and ploughed and cultivated
Well even then it yields very little
There is some of it lying bare at this day
Now the quantity of grain obtained from that is so very little that although the rent is not high it can never yield very much
I have seen some of that land which has been cultivated now for twenty years and I dont believe it is any better than when the first crop came off it in some cases it is worse
Then another kind of poor land is that adjoining these shores where the cliffs are high and where the waves break over these cliffs and the waves saturate the ground when it is just about to blossom and in that ground there is never any grain nothing for meal nor anything and I have even seen it so saturated that is was of no use even for fodder for animals
Another kind of poor land is the sandy land
There are several crofts of that kind which yield fairish crops but the grain is not heavy
But although it beats heath in grain crops they have I believe a greater  disadvantage because those who occupy the sand can raise neither cattle nor sheep to be any help to them for if they attempt to keep any beyond a few months they die on their hands
I spoke also of fixity of tenure
I have seen what I should call ravages committed amongst the crofters and cottars in that matter
I have seen just wholesale evictions whereby the whole district was depopulated to make way for a large farm
Of these men there remains not one now with the single exception of an old man who occupies a house on the farm of Howe he and his sister are all who remain out of  or  cottars holding from the principal farmer
When the principal farmer left and a new farmer came that was the time when this wholesale eviction took place
That was the largest eviction I have ever witnessed but now and again I have seen evictions
I have seen them often I have seen them in the south end
I remember a man called Richard Peace was evicted for some dispute there are men here who can explain why he was summoned to remove the information could be got but I think it was some dispute about seaweed or kelp
Somewhere between twenty and thirty years ago maybe nearer thirty but the case of Richard Peace is more recent
There was an eviction in Burness where three families were evicted apparently for no public cause at any rate
But I will give an illustration of that as I am personally acquainted with it
I rented a small croft from Colonel Balfour or at least from his factor I had been three years there and the barn was useless and there never had been any stable
I asked the factor to put up a new barn and a stable and he answered that if I required a new barn and a stable I could put them up for myself
But I forgot to say that I would do it myself if I got security
I was told about that that if the security I already had did not please me I could leave
Well I saw no chance for myself or family so I built the barn the one year and I built the stable the next
By this time I had a pair of horses
I had occupied this barn and stable two years when I was summoned to remove at Martinmas
I had no place to go to my old mother was alive and I asked her liberty to get myself and family in the end of her small croft so that I could get time to look out some other way
I asked that at the factor but was completely refused and sent out
One neighbour took one horse in beside his own and another took my other horse and there was an old hole of a byre which contained my cow and calf
Now my fodder got done at the end of the year and I had nothing to give my horse
I sold the youngest one for  s and the man who bought him I believe he is here just now kept him a very short time until he was offered  for him
Now these were losses I sustained from being summoned to remove
There was no reason I was not due them a farthing
I was not having any row with a neighbour but simply I believe because my old mother had a small croft alongside and I suppose they thought because she had that that I was getting a byre and horses with a view to assist her as well as doing my own work
I dont know that
I cannot answer that question further than that it was thought that that was the reason
To a Robert Cursitor
At the same rent
About the seaweed the large farmers generally claim most of it and if the small crofter requires any he wont be allowed or if the large fanner has a ton he will perhaps sell it to the small crofter and I believe that is only to those on the same estate
But since the kelp has been discussed I dont think I need delay you about it
But there are some things I may be allowed to mention
A man had not stored his kelp and the consequence was that when he went into the market he got s less for it because it had not been storedthat was the man who made it
Well there was no store supplied by the proprietor yet because of not storing he lost s a ton
I think that is the most of what I have to say
Yes that was pretty freely discussed
She was paying it
She was in receipt of parochial relief for an imbecile sister she had none for herself
Yes of a good kind at least of the arable
Yes if that were possible
There is plenty of land in the parish
There is a farm which I believe is some  or  acres and the one next that is three or four farms thrown together and I could not say how many acres it might containperhaps  to  And the next would be perhaps  and another  or  acres
These are only approximate figures
The last mentioned farm is Howe on which the wholesale eviction took place
Yes
Yes
Yes
They are forced to do that when there is nothing for them to live upon
They might if they remained cultivate the croft
But what I meant was there is a family say take mine for instance I have several sons one is in England and another is in Kirkwall and another was engaged at a mill and I have just one little boy forbye
I am able to work as much as I have been doing yet but the croft I have and my wife alive would not be able to support us unless I was to make some other shift for work Now it comes to be hard if a young man has to be hampered like this and some of them feel it to be so
They think that if they have got a little ground they would prefer to stick with the old folks if they could make a living
Well unmarried and if the proprietor should agree about that there could be no objection
I suppose he might
I am only supposing it to be when the man is very old and if the son gets married about that time it is not likely the old man would fash them or be any hindrance to the young man
I would consider it much better for the old man to be beside his son than in the poorhouse
About six weeks
Not then I was never requested to support her
No
Mr Calder
No he is dead
I have
I did
Which part of it
In the first place in regard to the meliorations and improvements upon the estate here I believe Mr Traill my constituent is as indulgent to the tenants on the property in Sanday and Stronsay as any other landlord all over the north of Scotland
I may mention that I am connected with the county of Caithness where he has large property with a rental of  or  and he treats his tenants in Orkney on the same principle as he does the tenants there
The late Mr George Traill when he was proprietor did increase the rent occasionally but he never did so without getting a valuation made by a competent party
The improvements consisted principally of drainage and a good deal of the money was spent in building good substantial houses upon the estate
The proprietor took up the greater part of the money he borrowed and a good amount from his own private income
The tenants did not insist upon getting their houses done until their land was first improved and I think very wisely too so that we are still going on spending money in building and providing good house accommodation in the way of dwelling houses and office houses for the tenants on the estate
It is a rule upon the estate that leases are always granted for  or  years as the tenants may prefer
I always recommend them to take a long term as I believe it to be of most benefit to themselves and I find it a very curious thing that when I enter into a lease with an Orkney tenant he always insists upon having a break at the end of the first second or third year and I never hesitate to give them that option because I know it is never taken advautage of
It never has been taken advantage of
I am very much astonished to hear as I have done today certain grievances stated
It quite surprised me to hear there was any grievance at all on this estate
It is stated that the laud is too high rented
I now hold in my hand the last valuation Mr Traill got from a gentleman whom you will all recollectthe late Mr MPhee of Elgin who was I believe supposed to be one of the best valuators in the north of Scotland
And I may state that the crofters of whom there are fiftyone on Mr Traills estate in this island alone are paying at present from  to  per cent less rent than Mr MPhee valued these crofts at in  and these rents have still remained at the same amount so that so far as the complaint of overrenting is concerned I think there is no ground for it
The next complaint they make is with regard to the kelp
The price paid to the tenants for the manufacture of kelp is said to be  s
That is correct to a certain extent but they leave out of view that the tenants deliver at the rate of  cwt to one ton whereas the marketable amount is  cwt so that the real price is  s d
I make up generally every year a statement with observations so that Mr Charles Traills property or income tax be as assessed upon it and I have brought with me the statement for the last two years
There I find that for the year  the amount of kelp made upon Mr Traills estate both in Sanday and Stronsay was  tons the proceeds of which had a market value of  s d
Of that sum he paid away in expenses  s d and he paid to the crofters who gathered and manufactured and burnt the kelp  s d so that the balance coming to himself was only  s d for the year
But from that there remains to be deducted the taxes he paid upon the rent charged him for the kelp shores
I believe it is not generally known among the tenantsand I think they should know itthat the proprietor is assessedcharged with a rent for his kelp shoresin proportion to the amount of the profits made out of them that is the quantity of kelp manufactured so that out of the  compared with the  paid to the people who wrought the kelp Mr Traill has to pay all the taxes falling upon him as proprietor in connection with the proceeds of the kelp
Yes he first pays the due and then the income tax upon the profits
He pays upon the  income tax and then the property tax upon the rent put upon the sharesthat is onehalf of the net profits
For the year  the manufacture of kelp was much less  tons  cwt the market value of which was  s d
The expense of keeping up the kelp tools and shipping and other expenses connected with it amounted to   s d and that year there was paid to the tenants  s d having a balance of  s d for the proprietor subject to those deductions I have already mentioned for public burdens and taxes
I have not been able to get that as the vouchers are out of my hands but perhaps  or   so that for the year  he would really not have  and the tenants get  s d
This year I am glad to say it will be a little better it will come up to about  tons instead of  I may mention the fact that some years ago the profits of the kelp were such when prices came down that Mr Traill had some thoughts of giving up the manufacture of it altogether
But I spoke to him on the subject and said that from my knowledge of the tenants in Sanday which extends back now since  nearly a quarter of a century that I did not think they would be able to pay their rents unless they were employed in the manufacture of kelp so that he has still been carrying it on simply and purely for the benefit of the tenants to enable them to pay their rents and support themselves
This year I am sorry to say we have been threatened with a reduction in the prices
The price formerly was  s a ton
This year all over all we could get was  s only we have made an arrangement with Mr Fairley who purchases the kelp that if he gives a higher price to any proprietor in Orkney we will get the benefit of it so that the tenants will benefit by getting the full profits that can be made out of the kelp that is that he will make the best bargain he can for them
I may mention that some of the tenants recently sent a petition to Mr Traill somewhat in the lines they have taken today stating that the crofts were high rented and that they wanted to get the kelp handed over to themselves to gather manufacture and sell in any way they thought proper
I do not think taking into account the interests of the tenants themselves that that would be a good arrangement because they could not sell it at the same advantage that the proprietor could do and as I have said the kelp manufacture here is carried on by the proprietor not for his own interest but simply as a source of revenue to his tenants on his estate here
I dont think I have anything more to say
The benefit he derives will bo under  but that does not take into account the trouble I have with it in selling and corresponding and making up accounts I charge the estate with my own factors fee and expenses
I was very much astonished today to hear from these witnesses who came from Mr Trails property in Stronsay on his estate of the Housebay the statement made in the first place that their rents were too high I have to make the same remark with regard to that which I did with regard to the Sanday property
Mr MPhee valued these properties and their rents are in the same proportion as those of the Sanday tenants
With reference to the charge that the proprietor has done nothing to assist the crofters I may mention that in the case of James Shearer who pays a rent of  s I have actually incurred accounts to the amount of  s d in connection with his holding
In the same way an expenditure has been incurred in assisting the witness Maxwell to erect a dwelling house on his croft
The rule in regard to the dwelling houses on Mr Traills estate is this that the tenant puts the stones upon the ground and builds them aud the proprietor provides wood woodwork slates flags and lime
That is done for the purpose of keeping down taxes
On many estates the proprietor incurs the whole outlay and charges interest on it but I adopted the arrangement I have mentioned for the purpose of keeping down the rates of the tenants so that their rents are not increased any further
We have assisted these cottars as we do upon the whole estates in Stronsay and Sanday in draining and improving their ground and we have done that in some cases by getting them to do the half of the work for example the proprietor opens the drains and the tenant fills them and in other cases where the ground is shallow we provide them in addition with tiles and they do the filling in
Another thing we have done there is that the proprietor paid the late tenant of Housebay when these lands at Housebay were being improved for ploughing up their ground to them
Their own horses were weak and the horses of the larger farm were much stronger for ploughing up the rough ground and they got assistance in that way to improve the land for themselves
I may mention that the quality of the land at Housebay is very superior except in the island of South Ronaldshay there is no better land in Orkney
There is a vein of red clay which touches Orkney and which runs into Forfarshire and East Lothian and forms the richest soil in the kingdom
If the land had been in East Lothian it would have been worth  or  an acre but they dont pay anything like that and I am glad they derive benefit from it
I am always willing to encourage the smaller tenants more especially and I very frequently get it thrown up to me that I am kinder to the smaller tenants and crofters than to the big ones
That was said to me by one of the largest tenants on Mr Traills estates in Orkney on my way north a few days ago
Then there is another grievance which I may explain in regard to working for larger farmers
Some years ago all these cottars at Housebay were cottars holding directly from the tenant of the farm
At the end of the last lease the tenants requested me to take them out of the hands of the tenant and allow them to come directly under the proprietor
I consented to do that because I believed it would be for their benefit and one principal reason of that was that the proprietor would spend and actually did spend more money than any tenant would do in improving their lands and houses and making them more comfortable than they had been hitherto
The obligation with regard to the working is simply this the tenant of the farm there who holds a farm of over  acres of land said to me If you take these cottars from us I cannot carry on this farm and cannot take a new lease unless you make some arrangement whereby I can have the benefit of their work and labour in the farm
The arrangement I made was as simple and easy for them in the circumstances as it was possible to make and that arrangement was this that these tenants were bound to give labour that is to supply a woman in the spring season of the year when the crops were being laid down and at the thinning of the turnips and during harvestthat they were bound to supply a handand that the tenant of the large farm was bound to pay them the current wages of the district
I thought that was the fairest arrangement I could make in the circumstances
At the time these crofters expressed themselves as quite satisfied with the arrangement knowing as I believe they do know that unless some arrangement of that kind is made the large tenant would not be able to hold his farm or to work it properly
That is the position of matters
I leave that as a matter of arrangement between the large tenants and the crofters but as I said the crofters are quite entitled to get as high wages as any other person in the island
They have and I have spoken to the tenant about i t not so much to the present tenant as to the former tenant his late father
The wages have been increased
I think s a day and s d for drainers
I have been making inquiries and I believe that is the current wages in this island as well as in Stronsay
Yes
I understand s d is current wages in Caithness too
Yes but s d is the sum for a skilled workman
My understanding of that arrangement was this that it was generally a member of their own family they did supply but any girl would be taken to help in farm work
But I have known in one or two instances of a man whose family was grown up and left who has been obliged to supply a woman
That is part of the arrangement
I have said I requested him to do so
He had some thoughts of giving it up altogether because prices were going down and for all he got out of it it was little worth
Yes but that is subject to deduction of the burdens paid upon rent of the kelp shores
Perhaps that year about 
Yes for his rent of the kelp shores but you have to bear in mind he advances the money before the kelp is sold the tenants are paid immediately after the kelp is made at the Martinmas term and it may be months after that before he gets the proceeds of the kelp
We dont consider  a very large sum but it is still a source of income but I am much afraid the kelp will go out altogether
We increased the prices some years ago and gave them a higher price
It will be double what it was
The late Mr Purves my predecessor fixed the rents
Housebay is rather a peculiar case it was lying in a state of nature almost when the present tenants father entered upon it
He and Mr Macrae took a lease of it for twentyfive years and the proprietor and they spent a large sum of money in improving it
After breaking the surface of the soil they came upon the superior red clav I alluded to and they continued to improve the place so much that they set an example to the whole of Orkney and gave an impetus to the improvement of the whole of the north islands on that occasion
And to provide work for the place he built a wall across the back of the farm leaving out what was supposed to be sufficient allotments for fourteen of these crofters and assisted them to build houses
That would be between thirty and forty years ago
Of course these old houses had at first thatched roofs which are now out of order and we are in the course of assisting the tenants to build new and more comfortable houses with slated roofs
That is not the case he got assistance to make drains and build his houses
No if I had known I could have dons it
But as I have said I have actually paid the late tenant of the farm of Housebay for the use of his horses in ploughing up the ground for all these small cottars and assisting them in improving the land
I mean that and the father of the present tenant told me he could not keep the farm at all if he did not get the labour
He could not otherwise get the labour to work it
It is an arable farm
He could not unless a lot of Irishmen
Much less rent
I dont believe he could pay half the rent if he had to import the labour
No because they have a certain portion of labour it is only in one or two cases that they have to import it
He could go to another estate
But supposing he lost the whole of them he could not get the whole of them in the island that was the statement made to me when that arrangement was entered into
No most of them are natives they went across from Sanday a year or two ago
Mr Macrae thirtyfive years ago imported labour to make his drains and enclosures and build his houses but the usual farm work was done by people belonging to the island
Or their predecessors
Not so well because he only requires them at a certain time of the year and he could not provide them with accommodation for all the year round
You could not get a hirer for a month or two from the mainland of Orkney or Sanday
There is a small village in Stronsay where I believe they can get them there are a number of people there who earn their living during the herring fishing season and in the spring season before the herring fishing these women are to be got
Yes but the difficulty is this the large farmer told me he could not get the number
You may get a few or one or two
No doubt about that and I enter into these feelings of the small tenants in this respect that I emancipated them from the tenant and took them to hold directly from the landlord
He just spoke to me saying he might give it up altogether
Unless he provided some other source of employment for them
Yes
Yes
Oh yes it was
Certainly it was looking to his interest as much as to that of the tenants
Not altogether it was keeping the joint interests in view
The small crofters made a complaint to me but you must keep in view that they got the houses and small crofts under this stipulation
Very different from a monetary point of view
No there is none
I should be very happy if it could be to make the tenants more contented and at the same time supply the labour required for the work of the large farm
I should be very much pleased indeed and I have thought of that very frequently but I cannot get the means
In fact large farmers they cannot get labour themselves
No not at the time because I make it a rule when the lease of a tenant holding a farm runs out he shall not leave the property
I never like to advertise a farm if I can make a reasonable arrangement with the sitting tenant
I think that is easily explained by any person acquainted with the manufacture of kelp
They would not manufacture it of the same quality
I have seen fresh kelp in Glasgow which I would be ashamed to see come from Sanday in consequence of the mixture of stones
The same thing has been tried here and we have to send a man round to see that the kelp is properly made and I am glad to say that the quality of the kelp manufactured here is now much appreciated
There are shores we have to keep up connected with it and in former times we had to incur  considerable expense with the kelp boats until a pier was erected so that a ship could come alongside
Yes
There is current outlay and although the kelp shores were valued I suppose the profit the proprietor takes would not be equal to the rent of the kelp shores
In the island of Sanday they all hold from the proprietor directly with the exception I think of two or three upon a farm in the immediate neighbourhood of this place but those houses were left to the tenant for the accommodation of his farm servants
I understand however he has let them to some of his bowmen and given them a little land and a small wage for working on the farm
They all hold directly from himself
I may mention with regard to these three small cottars or bowmen on this farm that the lease is out at Martinmas first and they have applied now to hold directly from the proprietor himself
Very little since my connection with the property all that was done during the management of the late Mr Purves
Fully forty years ago at least more than thirty years ago
One of the best antiquaries in the island will explain that Mr Denison
He says bow is the old Norse name for the principal farm of a township and the  bowmen were men or servants living or working upon the bow
Merely farm servants in farm towns
Another derivation some people say is that farm servants used to be paid in kind with so many bolls of meal and that it was from bollmen the people drew the term but I believe the true derivation is from bow man or the principal man on a farm
A man of family who works a pair of horses
Yes the property at that time was not properly divided and little or no improvements were made upon it
The properties were then divided into small farms and a better class of houses built and a considerable amount of draiuage made at a large expenditure of money
I believe there was
They certainly did not at that time
So they have told me
Well to a certain extent it is
But on the large farms with which I am connected these small people were not
For instance the farm of Housebay was occupied by one or two tenants
No I dont wonder at it
He made a valuation but did not fix the rents
Yes
That is a personal matter
No Mr Trail had some thoughts of selling his estates and his agents in Edinburgh thought it would be better that a neutral person should make a valuation of the estates and fix the rents which should be paid rather than that his own employees should do it
I was told that Mr Traill had the intention of selling or at least thoughts of selling it
Of course not
Of course Mr Traill would expect that would be done
Well so far as I am concerned I always object to it as far as I can I dont look with favour upon it
Yes it is the only case I know when Mr MBey was asked to come
It has never been done on any estate I am connected with except one in Caithness the estate of the Scotscalder a good many years ago
One or two proprietors in the north of Scotland have done it but it is not a general rule
A reasonable factor could arrange a new rent under lease
He is dead
Yes
Yes
No in Sutherland just now
He has a farm in Sutherland and another in Caithness
I suppose you are aware of the fact that the present proprietor only came into possession of the estate a few years ago
In former times the price of kelp was very high and large amounts of money were to be made out of it
Of late years it has been falling off considerably
No I dont think so I had quite an opposite view from the fact that I believe the quality of the kelp would deteriorate
I believe that argument would have no effect at all from the simple reason that there is no competition for the purchase
There is only one man who will buy Orkney kelp and that is Mr Fairlie and if he got it in bad condition he would not take it I think it is the interest of the people to keep up the quality
It would do this harm that the proprietor would not get the rents
In some cases that is correct but not in every case
In some cases the big farmer pays the higher rent but I know other cases where it is the reverse
I have made a calculation of that
Orkney but the same remark applies to Caithness
I know there is but whenever there is a farm vacant there is a large amount of competitionfor every farm large or small
The thing does not apply to farms in Caithness only to one or two farms in Orkney where they have not the same population to fall back upon for labour
I would be glad to do away with it if it could be supplied by any other means
That is a question I can hardly answer
In some cases the small farmer does pay a larger rent but in other cases he does not
This may be explained for this reason that the large farms generally have a pretty large amount of hill ground and rough pasture which is not so valuable as the arable ground and taking the average the rent is less
But for the arable ground I believe it is about equal or as nearly so as possible
No Sanday is not an island adapted for sheep
Stronsay is and on Housebay there are a good many
I do
I believe they are in fact I have a great objection to charge one shilling more than a man is able to pay or than the land is worth
No I find as a rule that the Orkney tenants once we got an arrangement completed with them and a lease entered into give us no further trouble
That has not been the practice since I had the management
There was something of the kind in former years and perhaps I may explain how it occurred
When the improvements first began to be made there was a certain number of acres of land allotted and the tenants either built a house or houses themselves upon the place or they were assisted by the landlord
The rent was purely nominal perhaps s d or s for a few acres of land at the end of a fourteen years lease that was the duration of lease in former times an arrangement was made by which the rent was increased to  and s and in some cases the meliorations were sunk but I have been making it a rule to buy up the meliorations of the tenantswhich comes very heavy upon the landlord I have been doing it by degrees and then the property becomes the landlords
Then we charge a fair rent
There is a case where the lease is out at Martinmas and  was expended by the tenant on buildings when he got his last lease nineteen years ago he got the farm for less rent but I have now arranged to pay him that  and we will get the full fair rent
From the same family
Yes
I would try to answer any questions put in reference to it
Yes
No
I do consider that to a certain extent
Yes
Yes
The labourer himself sends the substitute
s per day ands d for draining
I dont know
In some parts perhaps it is better
Nine years
They do
They used to get d per hourd aday but now they get s
Yes
Just the same
When they have them they send women of their own family and when they have not they have to hire them
In most cases they have them within their own family
Yes
No I dont think so
Yes in our island
Yes I could not find it without them because I am isolated in one end of the island
No
I would not get them
Not out of the place
Yes it would
Yes it does
If I could find the labourers it would not matter to me
I believe they are dissatisfied
I could not say I have not had the experience
Yes some
About twenty or thirty tons
Yes
I cannot say because they make it at times that are suitable and they are not counting their time I suppose and it is according to the weather and how the ware comes
Yes the time suitable for making kelpthe dry weather
Yes
Yes it may be
There is a little
Not so much it is down this year from what it was last year
 s per ton
At Falkirk to Fairlie  Co
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
No there are some of them not there now but where they are I dont know
In place of some of them
Yes
Yes
Yes I could
Some of them went to Kirkwall and some of them are in the island still
Some of them left of their own free will
Yes
Yes
No I have the plan of the farm
No I could not
I could not
Yes
Yes
Yes if it is the day for threshing with the mill
I have a steam mill and if it is the day for it which is one day in the week I generally want them to come that day but not any other day
Yes
I have an agreement with them in regard to their holdings
They pay their rent to me and furnish the labour
Yes
Yes
There is no exact number of days stated
No
No
I dont require it
Nothing
  s d
I cannot say
Oh yes
I could not give a definite answer to that
I could not give a definite answer
Yes a good deal less
Yes
No
I dont think he does
Yes
Yes that is of cottars
 acres
That is squared off they dont hold that
Some of them were taken into the farm
The places of the others were supplied by other people
There is part of the east side of the hill which the proprietor wished to have removed for the purpose of taking in sheep
Yes I have the power
No they occupy from year to year
Yes
Yes
No I dont suppose he does
Yes the female labour is for the six months in the summer
Is a day
No because I could not get labour for it
No
From a ton or upwards each house
Yes or as much more as they like
No
Yes
 s per ton
From a ton to three or four tons
Yes
Yes
Yes
I cannot say exactly the quantity of kelp generally ranges from  to  tons in the year but I have had it as high as  tons
Mr Hebden
Yes
It was a commonit was added to the sheep farm
Yes of course there is some on which there is nothing but it was intended for sheep purposes
Of course we all use the peats
Yes the privilege was taken
South to several places
Not I but in other parts of the island they are
Yes so much
They are paid by the fathom
Yes
Yes
They must do it
Of course
It is chiefly the factor
Yes
Chieflythe most of it
Yes
About s and s the cwt or   or   the ton
Yes
Then it is the same here I am wrong
Yes they mean to say so
Three I think
My complaint is chiefly that we should have compensation for improvements in the building of houses and we complain that we are rented too dear
I dont know according to your own idea
Well I suppose so
I could not just say
It is chiefly nineteen years that is given
Yes
I suppose it is
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
It is the low rate of wages too
Yes
They could
There is a good part of Eday not cultivated
Yes
But there is an immense amount of common you know
Chiefly in winter they spoil the turnips
They dont spoil the turnips in summer
Of course they spoil the whole
Yes
They dont do so much harm so far as I know
I dont know I cannot say
There are a good many but a great quantity are killed
There is chiefly a trapper who kills them
No one gets leave to kill them
In certain cases
No
I suppose so if they could be got
Yes
No I dont know
A good lot
The most of them
Herring and cod
No
Yes
A good many
No
 s
I think
I could not say about three and I brought most of it in myself
Over three or four
Yes
I have one cow and a calf
No I cannot keep a horse
One sheep
There are some who have more and some less
Yes I put up the houses myself
None
None
Thirteen or fourteen years ago
Sitting in the house without any land
Yes there are a good many
Yes
I could not just say
About eight or ten in one season
They were fully biggerfrom  to   and 
For a farm
Yes
Some got leases in the island and some went out of it
Just hardly some were maybe nearly as good but some were far worse
Some new ground and some empty places
Some did and some did not and some got wood and lime and some did not
I dont see any way unless I were getting an addition from my neighbour
No I dont want to take it from my neighbour
Part of it is
Yes it is in part but not in a way that creatures could not go over it
Yes
No I have it to myself it is only separated from my neighbours by a mark
It is a small bit of a ditch or drain it is not a fence to speak of
I dug and made it with the spade
It will never be cultivated
Mostly
Of course there are places
Most of the crofters are along the shore and this is up on the hill and that would not do very well they are far from where we are these patches and if we did not get them we could not buy them
With seaweed
I dont know it is the best we can get and it is not very good to keep sometimes
Just the common breed
Yes
About threequarters of a mile
Most of them at the present time
Yes
No
A man who is dead long ago
A small bit of a house but it is down I reckon
The roof was off it
No
I dont know
I am aware I can kill them on my own property
Yes they can do that with their own
I dont know but we have not the liberty on the island to keep a gun
We dont get the liberty
Yes
It is because we cannot get leave to do it
We would just be put out
Yes on our own property I know that
They are shipped
South
Yes
I dont know it is chiefly I think for distilleries and things of that kind
Yes but I dont think they use any of them at Kirkwall I think they go south
I dont know
In a schooner
I dont know to towns and places as perhaps Leith or some of these towns
I could not tell you there is surely that or they would not be wanted
Since I first remember
It is a plentiful place for peats
Yes
No but we have complained at certain times
They have been complained of many a time but no complaint has ever been brought by the whole of us
There was no allowance for it
There is no allowance to kill them at all
Yes
No
No
The most of them are now getting new ones
Some of them were bad enough
In the earlier times that was the case I suppose with some of them
Most of them
Built and repaired
No
No not so far as I know
Yes
There are two of them not very large
Of course there are four but one of them is not so big
Greentoft
Carrick
I suppose it will be Stenoway
Stiel
Yes it is quite distinct
Away on the west side of the island
Yes on a part of each
No on the commons it is not in their boundaries it is outside
Yes at the one big farm
It was Mr Hebden who took them to the island
Maybe about twenty years ago or there about
No they were natives of the island
Yes
Yes
No
Yes at present
Yes
Yes a ewe and a lamb
Yes
Yes
Some of them have that and some have more
Some have a cow and maybe two cattle and maybe a horse and maybe some have two cowsand up and down that way
It was for the sake of the grouud being made into bigger farms
I dont think it
I think maybe three acres or thereabout but I could not just say  never measured it
I make it out of the sea
They could not live
Five children and my wife
No there is no chance it is all hill ground
I dont know not very able
I make my living out of the sea
The one year is good and the next year is bad and the bad year takes away the benefit of the good one
Pharay and Eday go together perhaps
I am not certain at all
I could not say for the island lies in that way that the greater part of the people are along the shore
I could not say
It will be the four big farmers I suppose
Some of it is
There is one of them has five pairs of horses
And they will have  sheep
I dont know there are nothing but bowmen and those who work out
It is mostly young men who are working at the farm and maybe a bowman or two
Not a great many
Two but most of the people are away at the fishing
No it was not the first
I dont know I think it was Rousay but I am not certain altogether
It lies away to the westward
No I dont think it they will perhaps be in Kirkwall
I think about a dozen or a score the people were away at the herring fishing this week
I dont mind altogether
Yes in the house with my father the laud was taken from him he was not fit to labour it and I was sitting with him
And then I went to the big farm and sat in the house four years on the ground of the big farm and wrought in the harvest for the rent
Yes
It is near the shore for the fishing that is the main thing
No there are not very many except poor people who are not fit to work all the others have a little land
He was just sitting under a man who had it and we just gave them so much work when required but it was in Mr Laings time that he had the land
Nothing but the value of our work to the man who had the land
Just any time he required my services
We got leave to live and work in the house
We did not get wages we just got leave to sit in the house
I dont know rightly it is chiefly wrought with a pair of horses and one fordel chiel
Sometimes two
The farmer
We are delegates from the district of Rothiesholm Stronsay to represent the state of the cottars in that district whose farms are sublet to them by the tenant of the main farm Rothiesholm
First we wish to make known that the farms we occupy have been cultivated by us and our ancestors except two from ground not arable most of it hill in its natural state which for the first three years could not pay for its cultivation by its produce  and some part of what we had cultivated has been taken and put into the main farm and hill given in exchange but no payment for cultivating the ground taken from us or rent diminished because we got hill in exchange
At present our farms differ in size between five and eleven acres or thereby of what we call arable and from six to twelve or thereby of hill
Putting them all collectively we pay about s per acre
Our houses we have to build at our own expense and if taken from us we have no compensation so this gives us little encouragement for improvement
The next we would make known is that which is felt to be slavery in the district
Most of us during winter and spring however necessary our work at home or if we should have an opportunity of earning five or teu shillings elsewhere must go when called to work on the main farm for s for ten hours of ordinary work and s d for draining
Also we have to make one ton of kelp and as much more as we can and sell it to the tenant of the main farm for    s per ton or  whatever price kelp is in the markets
During summer and autumn except about five weeks in harvest we feed and lodge a woman to work on the main farm
Her wages is Is for ten hours work
During the weeks referred to in harvest we have to send a man along with the woman to work on the main farm both have their cost for each day they work and whether their work should be five weeks or more the mans wages is    s and the womans    s
Also we require a cook to prepare and carry their food to the harvest fields her we have to feed and pay
Our desire is that in the future we may be free from bondage and have the ground we have cultivated let to us by a proprietor and not sublet by a tenant
There are eleveu families in that case but we have two more though we have not their signatures
We only represent one district but there is another report from another district lent it is not the same as ours for which reason we could not put it collectively
Yes
There may be a little difference but that is the general substance of their condition
From five to eleven acres of arable land and some six to twelve acres of hill uncultivated and I may remark that in my seniors day about fourteen of the little farmers were put into one farm and many more before his day
The tenants have most of them had to sesk a home where they best could
The last case was about five years ago I think
It is about forty years ago since it commenced
A few of them did
Many were old men who had spent their strength in cultivating the hill ground
They might have got a bit of hill ground but they could not cultivate it
And if it were cultivated it might have been taken into the main farm again
Yes partly it is about  acres now
Something over  but I would not say distinctly
 s for my own place
It is according to the size
The average rent taking the whole is about  s per acre and the arable ground is about 
The general stock is about two or three cowssome a horse and a cow and some perhaps have a heifer in addition
Yes if we could support them ourselves
The time was when we were at liberty to go through the hill but now there is more exemption from that
Yes among the crofters in that district at least
Not in my day
It was all common in my day
I remember the flocks being on it from different districts
It was all of course counted common
Yes and no man to hinder them
Yes our farms are too small to support and us without our devoting part of our time to the fishing
No
Some for a year and some for only eight or ten months according to the size of the farm
And many of us have to maintain a woman
I mean we have to buy her food and also to support her family
About five years ago
The present tenant we are not in connection with the proprietor at all we hold altogether from the present tenant
Yes
The cod fishing during the winter and the cod herring and lobster fishing in the summer
Almost that is we attend so far as we can to our ground we cultivate our ground in the first place
Yes I believe that is the wish of all we represent
Just so
Not too crowded but we are always driven out to the hill
If we were not driven out there would be plenty of room
The district is about  acres or thereby and there is only about thirteen of these cottars on the main farm
Yes
Yes
Yes I think it is
If we had opportunity of going to the fishing and making s if the farmer requires us We must go to the farm if called upon and get s
And when we want to go to the farm we are not required
We would like to have our liberty to hold from the proprietor and not under a subletnot to be in bondage and we would like more groundas much as could keep a family without our having to  spend part of our time at the fishing
No we want to hold from the proprietor as the farmer does
Yes we would be willing to work for him if he required us to work for pay
Just the current wages
Yes it is not always current wages for a mans work to get s
Yes in general they are
Yes I believe that

Yes
Yes it would be no difficulty for him to get labourers for all his work out of the district
James Cooper J
Heddle
James Twatt
We are quite at liberty in regard to the fishing we can sell to any salesman we think fit
We have no connection with the proprietor or tenant in regard to the fishing
No
Yes but we are not bound to one more than to another
Yes there are two cod curers and different herring curers
Yes and if not we can send them to Kirkwall
That is the main farm Rothiesholm but there are different main farms in other districts
Yes
It has always been there from the first I can remember but many little farms have been put into the big farm
Yes
Yes
Free from the bondage of the tenant so that we should not be obliged to go at his pleasure
So far as I am aware there is no subletting in our island except in this district
Yes I understand it is a general rule
Yes
Yes taxes accordingly
Yes plenty
Yes hill and arable
No he pays less
Yes I believe it would give more money for his ground if we all paid it to himself
No
Yes pretty well off they had the hill before them and they had their sheep and cattle and they were paying nothing
Perhaps in some places they paid Is or only d a head
No to the tenant
No m and

According to the circumstances the weather and the place we get the seaweed in
I can scarcely calculate on that because at some of the stands we have to carry it away twice and then cart it out
We cannot spread it out where it comes
I cannot say how long it takes to make a ton
I think not often below  so far as I am aware
At least it is as high as that often I know
It is more than that
Yes but it is best kelp not tang kelp
If we have one and if we have not one of our own we have to get another and feed and lodge her and all she gets is Is a day
We get no benefit by her in the least
I think about Kirkwall it is more than Is
No they have to provide their own food
No
Yes
Yes and it takes about  s to feed her and there is no compensation for her it is a gift
A few men servants
About six generally
Yes and perhaps a cattle man and perhaps an old man for other work
Yes
We must be ready any day in the course of the six winter months when called upon
Sometimes it may occur frequently and sometimes not for a while but whenever he calls we must be ready to go
Yes man and woman
Much more
Not all of us all of us are not exactly under that bond
There are eight under that full bond
All have not to keep a woman but almost all of us have to work ourselves
I cannot say
My fellow delegate might be called upon more than me
Some may be called of oftener and some fewer when the farmer thinks proper
When we are settling the rent at Hallowmas termabout the th November
Yes
I never get money I have always to pay
 s
No never
Yes
Yes we would be willing to do it only we would want the current prices for it
Oh no we would not wish it to cease

Yes
Mr Muir
At the request of Mr Grant I appear but not officially for North Ronaldshay
Yes
Part of the parish of Lady
Yes part of Lady parish
It is separate from the other two parishes in this island
A civil parish
Yes
I have
I may explain that the most of what I have to say is contained in this statement
I may also add that I am not intimately acquainted with all the small details of how the people are situated and therefore I am less able to give information than many of those who are present at this moment
By myself
With the delegates who were appointed
They were not counted but it appeared in the public prints that there were somewhere about forty present
No I am responsible for the statement
Yes I think so
No I am entirely responsible for it
 The soil on which the most of the people who have grievances in this locality live  is common which the proprietors have questionably taken possession of
Some if not all of those who built houses on this barren ground entered upon a nineteen years lease with the promise of valuation at the expiry of that time
 This promise of valuation was not fulfilled by the factor instead of paying this valuation he has claimed the buildings and charged in some cases more than double the original rent
 The system of letting and renting which applies to large and small farms alike is entirely at the option of the owner
The tenant is no free agent but must submit to the owners terms or be ejected
Tenants have reclaimed lands and have been punished for so doing by rise of rent
 There is or rather there was another class who were so unfortunate as to have a few acres of fairly good soil in close proximity to a farm of some pretentions whenever the opportunity offered itself those small holdings were swallowed up by the larger farm
This practice has been carried out to such an extent that now there are five farms almost joining on to each other to the extent of eight miles which means that many families have had to leave their homes
 Then there is another class called cottars who hold a piece of ground from the large farmer and at any time is liable to be called upon when he must leave his own work and attend to that of his masters
 The extremely large farm and the extremely small one are the evils which chiefly lead to our pauperism
The large farmer employs those termed  bowmen  when these men get old and unable to work they are cast aside like some old wornout machinery and are compelled to apply to the Parochial Board for support the same thing applies to the occupier of a few acres of ground which is incapable of supporting a family
 The manufacturing of kelp is compulsory on many of those small crofters and they do not consider that they get a fair share of the profits made on that article
 The law protects the lower animals against cruel and improper treatment much more do we think should it protect man against cruel oppression and tyranny
Yes
It was all heather the poorest soil on the island and nothing but heather
I suspect it does but I dont know
It was occupied in common by the people all over the parish I believe
I am not able to answer that question the proprietors arranged or divided what was considered common by themselves and the inhabitants and by what authority they divided it I am not able to say
I am not
No I dont believe they did
Many of them did I cannot say that all did
Consigned in writing
No not in every case
I know some cases in which it was not
I dont know of any cases in which it was fulfilled
I have this document here 
The party from whom I received this did not wish his name to be made public
Not one
They have whether rightly or not they are under the apprehension that they have no law to support them in case of injury
The common injury from which they suffer is I understand that when the nineteen years lease is entered into with the promise that they are to receive a valuation at the end of that time when the lease is out the proprietors say you must allow this valuation to sink and we will only charge you so much rent in future and it usually is an advance on the past rent so that instead of receiving the promised valuation they receive nothing and an advance of rent is put on for their own improvements during the last nineteen years
The farmer has no encouragement to improve his soil because he is actually punished for improving it
Yes
Yes it is so far but the tenant has invariably to fall in with the proprietor simply because he does not wish to leave his home and it is ejectment if he does not fall in with the proprietors arrangement
I dont know of a single case in which a removal of that kind has taken place and I am therefore unable to answer
Wherever they get a chance they do that
In which they received valuation I dont know of any case in which they received valuation and went away
There may have been some cases but I have not thought over that matter
Yes I have been told by many of the older people that that is the case
As a rule he has been thrown out on the world
I dont deny but there may be cases of that kind but at the present moment I dont know of them
I believe there are those here who can name cases of that kind
I am under the impression that he pays him nothing but I am not prepared to say that that is the case
I know some of them who pay their rent to the tenant and receive payment for their labour besides
There are others I believe on a different footing but I am not perfectly acquainted with those cases and therefore I am not able to give much information on the point
It was merely the general grievances I put down not being so well acquainted with the matter as the most of those present
Bowmen are married men who have houses given them to live in by the tenant and they work to the farmer the year through and receive so much money as wages and so much meal and so much milk during the year
Yes a farmservant
I am unable to say
I understand he pays a rent for a small croft but is in addition to that compelled to make kelp and he receives pay for that labour at so much per ton of kelp
It is not specified but there is a certain season of the year at which it must be made or it is of no service
Usually it is about seedtime when they are required to work kelp
I believe so
When the cottar who works for a farmer sends a representative he pays that representative himself
He pays the farmer a sum of money for the soil he has from him and he receives wages for the work which he gives to the farmer I know that is so in some cases
So far as that goes he is perfectly satisfied with his bargain
But there are those I am told who are not so well off in that respect but I am not able to explain the exact nature of their grievances
There are others here able to explain that
The labourer himself pays the representative because as I understand it he is like a small tenant on the large tenants estate who pays his rent to that tenant with the provision that he gives him labour when asked to do so and if he is unable himself to do the work he has to send a representative
I am unable to answer that question
I am not prepared to say what I would substitute
No certainly not but I merely state that that request of some of these men who feel it is a burden upon them and some of those receiving fair wages
In other cases I believe they are placed at a greater disadvantage for when old age sets in upon them their wages have been so low that they have not been able to lay past anything for their own support and therefore when they are unable to work they are quite helpless
I am not aware
No
I merely state the grievances which the people have suffered from
I am unable to state the remedy
Separate cottages
Yes
They are often so kept when they have sons who are able to support them
Yes he is sometimes taken on and he to a certain extent largely supports his father when the latter is unable to work
In some cases the son supports the father
No there is no work for them
No small industry here to support them
I am not able to say I should think about four
But perhaps I am wrong I have not considered the question
I am unable to say
I dont think there will be that
The party is willing to have the facts of the case recorded
Yes
Yes
Yes I think that is so
Yes
Well he was compelled to do so
He did not wish to pay his advance because he did not think the place worth it but he says he was told that if he did not accept of this they would pay him his valuation and let him go and rather than do so he agreed to the arrangement
Yes

Yes
There is no valuation put upon it
The house I live in is separate in some respects I just bought it and paid a small amount for it so that is separate from the farm house
Between four and five years
Yes
No
I was
I dont think that is so they selected me because they could not get any one who would  communicate with the Royal Commissioner and I agreed to do what I was able for them I think that was the reason
Not that I was acquainted with the state of affairs for I told them I was not because I had been out of the place for a good many years and did not know the circumstances
I am not aware that they did
Well I think that may have had something to do with it
I am not able to state the reason because I am in the dark regarding that
Yes they are engaged I understand from year to year they have no other holding
Not always
He may if it is arranged with the farmer
Quite so
That may be so I believe it is so
I think in every case they are natives
There may be one or two exceptions that is all
I think the latter is the way
I think that is the reason
I said so
These farms I may explain are not all in this parish but one begins in this parish that is the firm of Hamarbreck the others are Howe Backeskail Worselter and Stone
I am unable to say
It has been a thing of gradual growth
I am unable to answer that question
No I think they go far back comparatively a number of years
I could not
These points were never spoken of and therefore I am not able to answer
There have been such cases but I am not able just now to state their names because it goes further back than my day
Yes
Yes it was so
Some of them I believe are in Australia and some in other parts of the world and some are in different parts of Orkney
It is doubtful
I am quite unable to answer that question
Yes I have heard them say so and some people have remained here but what number I am unable to say
 I think
Yes there are
Yes a good number but not a very large number
I do not know exactly what is called a croft
They would occupy I think fully a third of the island
I am unable to answer that question
Some do complain of it but generally the complaints are about their own places being too small
But they as a rule dont suggest how they are to be put into a better position
I am not aware of any case of that kind
Yes they were better off I daresay pretty far back
I understand that a great many of these small tenants were put off the arable land at that time and put out on the common to cultivate that soil or leave as they chose and to make the best of it and it is to a great extent these small crofters who have cultivated the common and who consider themselves aggrieved by the rents being raised upon them after they had got it into a condition to bear a croft
I dont know that they were compelled to take it in they were allowed to build upon the common pasture and they did so and for a number of years they received nothing for their labour simply because they had to live upon their crop
I think it was voluntary in every case that they did build on the common
Yes
Because they would rather try to live there than leave their native place
Yes
Yes
The principal grievance I understand is that the holding each has is so small that they cannot  live upon it and it occupies their time so much that they cannot properly attend to anything else to make money
It is a miserable life for them to be living upon the few acres they have of that soil
There is very little that I am aware of
That seems to be the impression amongst a numberthat it should be at the expense of the big farmers
Every man has been defeated by the landlord
Yes that is what they feel
Yes I believe that is about how it stands
Yes
Yes I think that is how it stands
They are disposed to cling to the island very much
I think they are very general in the island
Fourteen years is I think very common
They do believe so
I do
J
C
Trail
No
He does
He allows so much when they put up buildings
He allows a certain proportion of the building but the tenant has to do the quarrying and carting and the building of the steading and at the end of his lease and when he leaves they consider this steading their own
It is then the proprietors
There has been a good deal of that in the past and it is still going on
It is not considered good fishing
There is a number of small boats going out but it is not considered a fishing place
Entirely so
There are of proprietors of any size five
One resides in the island for a good part of the year
During the last two or three years his principal residence has been on the island
None whatever that I am aware of
I am not very certain
I think it is Is in the pound
No it is not complained of much
Four
The statement I have to make about North Ronaldshay is rather an unsatisfactory one because I expected a statement from Mr Grant who is now away and I have not received it
The grievance there I think is principally the tyranny of their proprietor
They have no roads on the islandnot a single foots breadthand their houses are miserable there cannot be worse I think in the country
To look at them from the outside they are mostly like the stone dykes that we have here
They have seen no lime and the proprietor will not be at the expense of improving them
He gives them no encouragement to improve
They have no leases and they are living in such a way that they may be put out any day and the people feel that
Then two or three years ago if I remember rightly to show how they are oppressed by the proprietor they went into Kirkwall with a boatthey had arranged before going to start a fishing stationthey went into Kirkwall and brought out a boat full of salt and engaged an agent in Kirkwall for their fish
They then came back to North Ronaldshay and went to Dr Traill the proprietor of the island and told him what they had done and asked him if he would give the use of a store which was standing on the beach for the purpose of the fishcuring
He refused to give them the use of that store and without it they could not carry on their fishcuring
They sold part of their salt in the island for family use and the rest they sent back to Kirkwall and sold it there at a disadvantage
Now they considered that a very great grievance because it deprived them of means of livelihood or of making an addition to their means of livelihood from their small crofts
They feel it hard that they have not the liberty to do what they wish
As to the complaints which they have about their farms and their rents I am unable to say anything about that and only regret I have not the particulars to lay before your Lordship
Fishermen and farmers
About
They are mostly all small crofters and they go to the fishing as well
I am unable to answer the question
Yes
No
No
I dont know what object he had in it but they looked upon it as an arbitrary act without a cause
I dont think there is
I am unable to answer that question
It occurs to me now whether it was the actual reason or not I dont knowbut it occurs to me that there was some reason given that there was a small dealer there who bought fish from these people and who complained to the proprietor l a m told that if he allowed the people to start a fishing station it would deprive him of the small business he did in exchanging goods for fish
A dealer you cannot call him a curer
That was the report
There is one man I am told who was evicted or his father and who is now living in Kirkwall
I am not aware because I have not inquired
I dont know
The only reason they attribute for it is the helpless state they are in they are afraid of offending the proprietor and they are under the impression that for the last offence he may possibly put them out
I cannot answer that question
There are other two but they are both smaller
I sent a notice over there
I think one very strong reasonperhaps the principal is that they are afraid they may offend their proprietor
They have in some respects more reason because some have leases and in some of the other islands they have none
I think the people are more retiring than the Highlandersmore timid
Perhaps not
I am
 A meeting of crofters was held at Vassa on Saturday the th day June for the purpose of discussing any grievances that might be found to exist in the district and to appoint delegates to present the same before the Royal Commissioners presently inquiring into the condition of crofters in the Highlands and Islands
Mr John Spence inspector of poor was called to the chair
The crofters entered into a long and lucid discussion of the land question and it was moved and unanimously agreed to that the chief causes for complaint are st High rents  nd Insecurity of tenure  rd Want of compensation for improvement  th  Inferior quality of dwellings  th The landlords claim to a share of whales captured in the areas of the sea around the coast  th No roads
The chairman was appointed to draw up a statement embodying the foregoing resolutions and to lay the same before a meeting to be held on an early day
The crofts consist of from three to six acres
The people understand merks as the measurement
The labour I refer to is chiefly carried on by women who work daily on the crofts
Yes the old woman of the house probably attends to that while the younger portion of the family are constantly engaged in carrying turf from the hills and seaweed from the shore and breaking up the green and other thingsall the land being handwrought with the spade and without machinery
Everything is carried in baskets on their backs ponies are not used because there are no roads
Fifteen years
Yes
Yes
They attend pretty well but the roads are a great drawback
No children can attend during the winter season because of the want of roads
On the average the children travel two miles
A few
Perhaps two and a half or three miles at the most
Very often
Occasionally they are by a person appointed by the School Board but the people have a great many excuses such as distance and so on
No it is diminishing almost at a ratio it is about as low this year as I have seen
I dont think it is
The School Board seem to be doing all they can
The great complaint is the want of roads and crossing burns in the winter time
Seven gentlemen elected by the people
The factor on the estate of Symbister is the chairman
There are no clergymen on the board
We have a farmer and Mr Anderson merchant Lerwick Angus Donald Lerwick the minister of Whalsay Mr Zachary Hamilton and Mr Sutherland
No
No not to my knowledge
They dont consider themselves qualified to come forward on public matters they are chiefly seagoing men fisherman crofters and sailors
They wish to send forward people whom they consider better qualified
Wages have risen very much since the fishing industry developed
The common wages twenty years ago would have been d a day and victuals
About the fishing stations it may be more but in the country where I live I pay d a day for people working to me and victuals
More than that perhaps nearly d because we generally give them plenty of victuals
It does not produce more than that directly but it produces it indirectly by giving a house to the family and allowing one to be his own master
The fisherman can sit down and take his leisure for a few days whereas the man who is bound to work day by day must work continuously
Mr Clark has handed it in
About twelve or fourteen
Most of the men were at the fishing but those who were at home were at the meeting
Yes and Mr Clark was the chairman
Yes
Yes
I might say a little
The chief thing I want to lay before you is about our roads
I have paid road money for about twenty years and have got scarcely anything done except what we have done  ourselves
The next thing is Mr Bruces wire fence
It is quite broken down in many places
Sometimes our sheep go in on the estate and sometimes the tenants sheep are driven on to our scathold and that is very unjust I reckon
Yes
No
There should be a proper fence between because some of Mr Bruces tenants sheep feed upon our property and ours are poinded in his property
No because they have plenty meat inside and are bigger
We have to the factor
I never saw the proprietrix in my life
I dont think she ever saw her own property
Mr Sinclair Pottinger but he has only been factor for one year
The previous factor was there ten or twelve years
He says very little one way or another
Of course we reckoned he had but newly come in and could not know much about it
The present hill is in contemplation of being divided and if division takes place we dont know who may come on
It may be taken in altogether but we hope not
Both Bruce and Lady Nicolson
Not unless she is forced she is an old woman nearly off the stage of time
She will make little repair upon old houses and she wont build new ones
I dont know
It is not anyone in Shetland but somebody away in the south some relation of her late husband
None whatever
The people have just to do the best they can
Thirty or forty years
Just twenty years now
I wish to say a few words about the rackrent system in land
She has forty merks all in patches and where I live it is two miles from one side of the township to the other and my lot is divided up into above twenty pieces
On each piece I have four different neighbours all around me and I cannot get to my piece without tramping on my neighbours land and they cannot get to theirs without tramping on mine and the crop is hardly to be seen and we have to transport manure mostly on our backs
Yes
About twenty they spoke to me
Well there are two things which I would like to mention there is a want of leases and heavy rents and these prevent tenants from being so active as they otherwise would be
The land belongs to the estate of Symbister and Mr William Irvine is factor
Yes we have it yet
Nothing in the parish of South Nesting yet but only a piece of small ground which was not of much value
I keep two milk cowssmall Shetland cowsand one twoyear old quey and one calf
Twoa mare and a foal
Yes
I could not tell you
Nine or ten not exceeding that
Exclusive of rates I pay  s now
I suppose about  acres of very bad land
I only have about half an acre of good land and the animals I have are all of the old Shetland breedsmall
Yes my rent when I took the croft thirtytwo years ago was  s d and now rates and all it costs about 
No we have a small bit of branch road from the main road
Between two and three miles and we have a small bit of a branch road about half a mile in length of which we bear the expense ourselves
I expect the tenants paid for it
I dont know exactly whether he did any thing or not but they were always taking your money at rent day and at last in that way they accumulated some money and commenced the branch road for there was a large burn there and they had to make a road over it
There is a road over it now which cost I am informed  but I could not say certainly
I t was always collected at the time of rent paying
Yes by the tenants
I do not know whether the landlord put anything into the fund or not
Perhaps so he might have put in a good bit for all I know
There is one thing I complain of and that is the want of more labour
There is no encouragement to us to labour on our own land because I can prove that people have broken up their land and brought it under cultivation and when other people came and offered more money for that croft the tenant got a letter saying You must pay us the money offered by this man or be turned off and I will take the other man and it may be that the man who offered was a sluggard and the other an active man
I do
It was done in Nesting of late years when Mr John Budge was factor in Symbister
Mr William Irvine of Hay and Co in Lerwick and a very fine man he is
Not now
There is only myself and my brother alive and we are past that
Yes
I dont think it
I think they pay their way but I am not sure
I have no concern with their affairs and I dont know how their accounts stand
They certainly must have an agent somewhere in town
No I think they fish to a Scotchman who has a station here
I have heard none yet
They have done much good to Shetland and I will tell you how
They have raised mens wages
I was for eight years manager of a boat in Lerwick and I had never above Is a cran for taking charge
s amongst them
They are very much better paid
I am telling you I took charge of a boat and only got Is for each cran I caught and the other men in the boat got d
I think by their accounts they only get a  per cran
Four besides me
We got s d for the cran of herring and the fishcurers owned the boats and nets and we caught the fish and laboured for them and got s d amongst us
I could buy from any shop but I had to stop in Lerwick and pay for boarding out of my earnings
No
The principal complaint in Nesting is the want of leases and heavy rents
No but there is only myself and my old wife and two daughters and we have to buy our food one half the year
I am employed yet but I am fit for very little
Messrs Hay  Co employ me as a fishcurer or else I would be the worse off
They have not done good to me but to the fishermen
Yes my grandfather belonged to Caithness
This is a Scotch island but it is those who have come from the mainland of Scotland who have done good to Shetland
It is my belief that if they had not come fishermen would have been receiving now the same washes as that current when I was a lad
GEORGE CLARK chairman
The next witness can speak about the fishing
But the point I would like to call attention to is the state of the houses and with regard to that have prepared a short statement which I can read
When I speak about the houses I refer not to the houses in South Coningsburgh but to all the houses
 At a meeting of crofters connected with the estates of Lady Nicolson and Mr Bruce of Symbister held at Nith on the th of June the following statement was agreed upon and Laurence Halcrow for Lady Nicolsons estate and Magnus Manson for Symbister estate appointed to lay it before the Royal Commission   We wish to retain our scatholds
If they are taken from us our present stock must be greatly reduced
Without the scatholds we can keep no ponies
GEORGE CLARK chairman
I became tenant of the house I am now in in  at a rent of  sterling per year
I also got about two acres of waste land along with the bouse with the promise that it should follow or belong to the house at said rent of  sterling whenever I might get it cultivated as it was very barren
In the course of about five years I got the land under crop and then wanted a lease of the place
John Bruce Esq promised to give me a lease but after a time when he saw me commence to build houses on the place he would not do so but said my rent should not be raised for nineteen years after
I built or raised the dwellinghouse from one room high to what it now is viz two rooms high and built three other houses as can be seen
In doing so it has cost me  sterling
As soon as I had finished doing so which was fourteen years after I got the promise from Mr Bruce that my  rent should not be raised for nineteen years at least nor should I be evicted I got notice that my rent was to be in future  per year
I then remonstrated with the landlord but he would give me no compensation for my money but would allow me to remain in the house at  rent per year
You are at liberty to show this letter to the Commissioners if you want to do so 
On the estate of Mr Bruce of Symbister which is managed at present by trustees there is not so much overcrowding but there is the same discouragement to those who would build
I know a crofter on that estate who built a nice house quite lately but he has no lease or promise of compensation
Another that I know a seaman built a cottage a few years ago worth at least  taking into account the time and labour he spent on it
He got a lease which I have here
Lease exhibited to Commissioners
If this man leaves the place before the expiry of the lease he gets nothing
If he remains whatever extra improvements he may make he gets no value for them for  is all that is allowed him at the end of the lease
The roof is a thatched one just now
If he puts on a slate one by and by he knows that he can get nothing for it
It is no wonder that young men do not care to build on such conditions
An intelligent farmer well acquainted with Shetland tells me that unfavourable as this lease may be there are worse leases given in Shetland
In some cases compensation is not even promised he says
Let those who are not crofters be offered long and favourable leasesleases that they can sell if they have to leave the place
Let those who have crofts have security against evictions and too high rents with promise of compensation for buildings they may execute at their own expenses and a better state of things I am persuaded will soon be seen not only in Conigsburgh but in other places in Shetland
While things are as they are there is no hope of improvement
Things must go from bad to worse
As regards the matter of the local authority I am fully persuaded of it
It is what I feel to be conscientiously true
I am to be examined and I stand here today saying these statements are perfectly true
I have done all I could to ascertain the facts accurately and while I may be wrong in a figure or two I am satisfied that the statement is substantially true
I have read the statement to the men of Coningsburgh and I have myself made inquiry into the matter
I have and so far as any one knows she has never been upon her property
I suppose that means outhouses
No he is a merchant that man
No I think he rebuilt the old house and repaired it
Yes because the man could do nothing else
He was living in such a miserable hut that he had to build
No but quite near to it
Yes but no garden
Mr Bruce of Sumburgh is here today if you wish you may lay the statement before him
Not at the present unfortunately but the agent for Lady Nicolson is present and I think Mr Irvine factor for Symbister also
Yes
Mr Macgregor a writer
Mr Irvine and he is also factor for Whalsay
In the hope that they would get that
Yes what annoys them is that they have no leases
They say that they were led to believe they would get leases and leases have never been given
I know one of them never asked for a lease but for two years they were led to believe they would get them
One has occupied his house for seven years and the other four and these leases have never been forthcoming
It is not the custom
I dont say much blame lay on the proprietors for not building the houses but rather for not encouraging the men more to build houses by granting better leases or giving terms of compensation in which case they would build themselves
If the proprietor gave  or   they would put up a very good cottage indeed
Yes but I would rather have those who are not crofters to have a longer lease
I know the case of a man just now in the adjoining parish who has a nineteen years lease and at the end of that he gets half the house in value
If he should have sold that I am sure he could have got a higher price
I am not
Dumfriesshire
Nearly eight years
Yes
Yes my church is the only one in the district
None since I came and I am not aware of any
None
I have I may be wrong but if I am so in one or two figures it is unintentional
I have gone over it again and again and done my very best
I have been very anxious to put it in the most favourable light
I have said  houses there may be  but so far as I can make out there are
It was the death of these two children lying in the churchyard brought me here today but for that I would not have appeared before this Commission
Yes but that is what brought the thing to a head on my part
 members
Altogether I have probably a congregation of  to
The statement I have read I read to most of the men and put questions to them and asked them if they thought I had overstated anything and they all said You are speaking the truth
The meeting at South Connigsburgh was attended by about  but there were those who represented others and I think the statement I have made is one that represents the opinion of the people
The statement may be correct or incorrect but it expresses the opinion of the people I have no doubt about that
Quite so
That is what I think
Probably it would be better to have the consent of the proprietor
I dont know  only speak the opinion of the people when I say that Mr Bruce of Sumburgh is not willing to build new houses or repair the old ones
It is stated that although Lady Nicolson is not willing to build new houses she is willing to give a sum to repair old ones
Of course in stating this opinion I am only expressing the opinion of the peoplewhat the people told me
They have stated that again and again
In the month of March of the present year
If the fishing prosper that might do very well but of course if the fishing were not to prosper the state of things would just become worse under that
That is quite possible
In speaking of these matters I am taking into account the hope that the fishing may prosper and a better state of things come about
Of course one might be mistaken about these things
Yes
No but the men have large boats and can go a greater distance now
In accordance with the desire of the Commissioners I have the honour to submit the following notes on the peculiarities of the measurement and tenures of land in Shetland the condition of the  peasantry the valuation and population of the county and the development of the white and herring fisheries
The Norwegians in the time of Harold Harfagre  than what was suggested by the course woollen attire of the country called Wadnel
Eight pieces of this cloth each measuring  ells constituted a mark
The extent therefore of each Shetland site of land bearing the appellation of mark was originally determined by this rude standard of comparison its exact limits being described by loose stones or shells under the name of merkstones or meithesmany of which still remain undisturbed on the brown heaths of the county It was sometime after the colonisation of Shetland that it became necessary to reduce each measurement of ground into still smaller allotments
But although the division was into eight parts its correspondence to the similar one of a mark of Wadmel was not immediately derived from this measurement
A nearer standard of comparison had succeeded to the Wadmel formed of a certain weight of some inferior metal
The division therefore of a markweight of this substance into eight ures or ounces appears to have suggested a name for the same number of portions into which a mark of land began to be resolved
 The merks lands of Shetland are generally consideredalthough the point is not free from doubtto have been originally the arable only and were held at first by udal tenure
But in addition each proprietor of merks land within the  room or township was entitled to a share in the hill pasture adjoining and appertaining to the township proportionate to the extent of his merks land
This hill pasture was and is still known by the name of scattald or scathold because such lands paid scat or land tax to the crown an imposition from which udal lands were exempt
Lands reclaimed from the scattald were termed  outsets and were and are still regarded as the freehold of the reclaimer after an undisturbed possession of forty years
None so far as I am aware
I believe not
As I have stated the forms of feudal conveyance are generally adopted but that is just for the sake of the security afforded by registration of the conveyance
I believe not
As a matter of fact I believe it is generally the largest proprietor in the room or township who institutes the process of division of commonty and his share in the scathold would be very much larger than any others
The portions of land formerly pastured on by the small proprietors would therefore be taken away and put into the hands of the large proprietor
I fancy the answer to that very much depends upon the meaning of the words  taken away
It is difficult to understand what crofters have meant by the words  taken away
That of course is a case of taking away undoubtedly
I dont know
I cannot answer that question
I am afraid that is a question I ought not to answer
I may have a very strong private opinion upon the matter
I only referred to cases brought before my Court
Yes I think so
My recollection is that it is five per cent but I am not quite sure
I have known cases where interest has been changed
I dont know that I would give interest at all it is a doubtful legal point whether interest is due
As a matter of fact I have deducted interest in some cases
I dont know of any rate of interest above  per cent that has come under my notice

That is quite possible
In speaking of these matters I am taking into account the hope that the fishing may prosper and a better state of things come about
Of course one might be mistaken about these things
Yes
No but the men have large boats and can go a greater distance now
My great grandfather my grandfather my father and myself succeeded each other on the same croft and in the same cottage until the year  In the year  no change had taken place so far as known to me with the crofters
In the year  the crofters had from early childhood improved and cultivated a great deal of fallow groundbroken it up and cultivated it
The consequence was that in  the landlord overlooked and measured it up and planted in the township or district to which I belonged where twentytwo crofts existed eight more and did not reduce the rent
Previous and up to  we were charged what are called teinds
Our land then was twentyfive to thirty shillings for three merks
We were charged as corn teinds two gallons of oil on each merk we had and we were charged one gallon of oil for boat teind
Wre had to pay four pounds of butter for each milk cow annually and twopence a head for every sheep on the scathold
In  the land was laid out In crofts in a different form and put in fields patches or lots and no more crofters were put in on the land
The teinds were no more heard of and where I once paid s to s I was asked in the first place  In consequence of that I objected and the proprietor graciously gave me down s of the rent
I said That will be for the next man I got a house in the parish and stopped there three years and then in consequence of a member of my family being in delicate health the doctor advised me not to remove to the township
They were then planting down squatters and a man had planted down and stopped one year
Another succeeded him and when he left I squatted after him and I am there I think for the last sixteen years
My rent is  and the usual rates
The most of what I have under crop I have cultivated myself trenched and drained and cleared
I think the rent too high I not only speak for myself but for those who elected me to come here
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
The house was built by the man who squatted down first but the proprietor repaired it and made it better for me
But he dont charge any interest on the house
It didnt require a new roof it was only the walls that were a little weak but I built the outhouses
I dont say that the people are not in better circumstances now than formerly
But what is the reason
Many have gone away to the colonies of Australia where they dug gold and supported their old parents
Some have gono into the mercantile service where I was myself and got better wages
We had no communication with the south when I was a boy almost except with one little sloop now we have steam communication and the south country curers are being introduced and there is a competition with the curers
Formerly our fish when we were at a low rent were at s d per cwt for ling s d for tusk and Is d for cod
That continued untd our land rent was paid for with fish and then we had d more on each cwt that we caught over which was often very little
The boats were weak and puny and the gear was different
The gear was handed down from our forefathers it was coarse
We had not the same boats or oars or the means of getting them and he was a lucky man who got in a sixern five tons of fish in the summer months
Mr Bruce brought boats from the south
My father brought one from Leith
There were eight men in it and Mr Bruce fitted it out and found everything
What was realised from the herring was somewhere about s d a cran to each of the eight men
It is not in consequence of the better treatment or lower rents or better holdings that we are now in better circumstances
In  Mr Bruce did give better houses but we have to keep these up
He will give us lime to put on the outside but we must put it on
Latterly we have been refused windows and doors for the houses and I am not aware of anybody being allowed to take them away or get compensation
No
There was a statement made about Mr Hamiltons farm
There were four crofts put into that farm
The crofters who were put out all got holdings in the island and scarcely any have been put off for giving short rent
Just one man lately and he got a fine chance
They said Take what you have and go and he would not but he went and built a mud cabin on the hill and lived there
There was a disagreement between the proprietor and the man who was evicted from his holding
He was in some way refractory so far as I know
No
I have been for some time in the sailor line in my time
About a dozen years
No just before the mast
Yes
I quite agree with it
Yes more tenants put on the land than there were there formerly
 I think
Yes he was
The factor had not come in then the laird was alive
Yes
From the islands
Yes
Yes generally just the neighbours
Yes
No none of them came from that
Yes
Yes when the land was turned up the rents were raised and the pasture land taken away at the same time
In the first of my time I paid I paid s a merk which was about an acre
But for the very same land for which I paid  without tithe thirty years ago I now pay  s with rates
We had no rates at that time neither poor nor school rates
They are  now on me so that really I pay  for what I got for  thirty years ago
No
Yes the very same
Yes
Yes
Yes there would then be better encouragement
No
Yes
The principal grievance at the present time is that our rents are far too high
We can raise very few cattle for that money and the pasture being taken away from us
Some of our townships have not one foot of scathold
The cattle never know where the hill is they must be reduced to the byre the whole season
Yes but it is very poor
I could not say
Yes Mr Hamilton has by far the best part of the scathold
The whole of it
In my time we had freedom to put our stock on any part of the hill we pleased and when the scathold was taken off it was a grievous thing for me for I lost about seventy or eighty head of sheep which were in the property he took off
And after he took it in my sheep lay outside until they died
Yes we had plenty and freedom
We never thought but that every tenant was to have plenty of freedom of the pasture
Yes but it wont hold them
And in our neighbourhood where the scathold has been taken off they must put their animals in upon us and it is as bad for us as for them
Yes on account of want of sheep we must all get cotton
Once we had warm wool but now we have nothing to wear but cotton sheetings
Yes
Ling and herring fishing principally now since the large boats have come in but they follow the ling fishing in the spring
The small boats used to go to the Outer Skerries and in the first of my time we used to fish from the land
We got for ling s d for tusk s d and for cod Is d per cwt
But then we had our land at s a merklow land and low fish
Our beef was s per cwt and our days work was d and find yourself
But now every man has freedom to fish to the best advantage but his rent is heavy and on account of our losing the pasture we are considerably harassed
I could not say
The people think themselves better off now on account of the times being more enlightened and they can see better what they are doing
We have to buy a great deal of our living now  the crofts can do very little for us
Yes the earnings are better
It is better now if we only had fair play with our land and pasture
Yes and by having use of the pasture as before
Yes
Yes he is not of age
We have been under the factor for a good many years and a good man he is
I would not like to see him going naked or hungry
Yes Hay  Co
Yes he has been
Yes they have a fishing station on the island
Yes
That is the great evil
Hay  Co
No he would allow no one to sell but himself I suppose
The island being four miles perhaps we send our children to the shop and they may have to stand there from morning till nightthere is a great run of businessand that is the reason why our children and perhaps ourselves cannot get served
And likewise the firm have had all their own way no opposition
Yes
No about current prices
Yes
Yes
As for the curer they always make away with all we have to give them
No
No he has the whole there is no opposition on the island
No
Yes they try to get the boats to themselves
Messrs Hay  Co mostly keep a sixth share of the boat and they supply the fishermen with boats until they can pay but the interest is very heavy
Not in the old sixern only in the big boats frequently four or five men hold the sixerns
Yes
Well so far as they can purchase them they do but if they cannot do that Messrs Hay  Co generally supply them on credit and assist them until they are able to pay
I suppose it is three years credit that Messrs Hay  Co give and they charge I suppose  per cent for what is due on the boat and they dry and let the fish pay for the boat
I understand so
 dont know what they do then
I suppose it must stand for debt still and be charged interest still
They fish on the halfcatch system
Yes
Yes in some cases when they are big boats
Yes
But the material for white fishing is not nearly so expensive as the material for the herring fishing lines are not so dear as nets
Yes I know some of the men who go for shares in boats at halfcatch in ling fishing as well as in the herring fishing
Half the fish
Yes
The owner of the boat mentions his price for the boat and as for the nets we generally know what they cost
Yes
Yes
He is a brother I think
Groceries of all kinds and goods as welleverything
No
No there is no licence for it
No
I am
Yes
WALTER WILLIAMSON Chairman th June
West Burra
There are about eighty crofters
The Misses Scott
Perhaps in Edinburgh
Burra is under trust I understand and for several years has been managed by Mr Garriock at Scalloway
I dont know that
It is for both islands both islands are united
We do
 s d for the bit of croft I hold and the small bit of another croft I paid  s d but the actual rent is  s d exclusive of rates for the croft I am in exclusive of the half croft
I think it is rather below the average
Perhaps  I would suppose exclusive of rates
I think there is one croft at  but only one
I keep three cows but then I have a bit of grass more than thisI have a guineas worth of  land in another place
I could not keep the three cows without buying provisions until I got that guineas worth of land
The sheep upon Burra are in open pasture
The pasture is very poor and has never been taken from us
Everybody is at liberty to keep as many as he can maintain alive
Some have as many as a score of the Shetland breed and several crofters have none at all
About a dozen
I would fancy about a score or thereby
About four or five cows would be about the most
Some years ago perhaps nineteen years ago I think or thereby we had  of rent laid upon the island and we were very aggravated and thought it unfair and that is what we complain of
We were then in Burra island under the thraldom of the truck system and we felt it very much because we had no power over our fishing
We had to fish to the tacksman and never knew the price of the fish until we came to settle and the tacksman could give us just what he pleased
We felt very much aggrieved and had several meetings among ourselves to see what plan or principle we might honestly and legally decide upon to keep ourselves clear men and free like Englishmen
Englishmen have the boast of liberty we could boast of none although we were British men
We were in bondage and slavery and we had several meetings to get our liberty the thing desired by all men
At one of these meetings we proposed to the law agent of the Misses Scott to give us a lease of Burra Isle for ourselves and we would promise to pay the yearly rent in a day
Hay  Co were then the lessees or tacksmen for Burra
We did not know that they were getting  off the rents of the island for drawing up rents and bad debts
We offered the law agent in Edinburgh the same rent they were paying which turned out to be  more than the proprietor was actually getting
The law agent very likely thought it was better to get it from one gentleman than from a lot of rude fishermen and crofters and he offered the same tacksman the land again at a new lease for the rent we were offering
He took it at that rent and laid  more upon us in return and that is how we think we are paying too much rent
I was in a half croft in Burra before that which was in a poor state
The house was not worth calling a house it was nothing at all
The roof was like to come down and so also were the walls
I went to the proprietor wanting assistance to build the house and was told their laws were to give no assistance and I got none
I added twelve feet to the house and made its walls higher and gave it almost a new roof
The following year I had s added to my rent and that I think an unfair and unjust thing
The very year it happened after the enlarging of the house when we wanted to get our liberty
I dont say it was because I enlarged the house but the house being enlarged there was no mercy on account of that which I think was a very unjust thing indeed
The croft has not been of long standing
I remember the son sitting on it as a tenantthe son of the man who dragged it out of its virgin state and put it into a croft
It was very shallow ground I itched up a good deal and quarried out stones and improved it in many ways and took a great deal of sea ware and laid it upon it and improved it for giving a crop and I was indignant that after all my improvement it should have been immediately raised in rent
The  was laid over the land but chiefly on those who improved
No
I dont complain of Messrs Garriock  Co
Since the Truck Commission came we have little or no complaint to make
It is the only time we have ever got anything like the free liberty of free men
We act under him in every circumstance as we please under the bonds of the civil law
He does not want our fish unless we want to sell to him  and if we want to sell to him he gives as good a price as any
Two years ago he gave us  more than any other body
I dont come to complain against Mr Garriock but I come here to complain of the confounded laws which hurt the poor crofters
I know the crofters have had a hard and bitter time for a long time back
I am free to tell that
Just shortly after the Truck Commission came
We were watching it with a good deal of interest and it is from that time only that the Burra people have had either a stitch of clothes on their back or a morsel of food
Yes and a most blessed thing it is
We can do anything we like either go to the merchant who gives the highest price or cure our fish ourselves
Last winter but they made little progress because the weather was bad but now they are working pretty hard
Yes a few have horses in Burra island but I have none
No carts no roads and no carts
There is not a cart on the island
Everything and the poor women work a good deal harder than many of the rich mens horses
No true gentleman would work his horse so hard as our wives are wrought and we must needs do that to make a creditable living
I did not for my own part wish to come here but the meeting which was held wished me to come and I said if they wished me I would do so but my time was past
There is nobody in Shetland has a bit of pasture anywhere worth while to take
It is in great danger of being taken proprietors have taken it away yearly
No and we have never heard of it being taken
It is not worth taking
It is a strip of island and remarkably seagirt and a great amount of danger connected with stock on it
And the land is very bad
We believe the crofting population not only in Shetland but in Great Britain is a great power
There is an everlasting amount of national wealth among the crofters
In Scalloway alone there is not a gentleman or businessman or fisherman or  common labourer but his father or grandfather was a crofter and in Lerwick it has been crofters since it began to rise
The crofters in England Scotland and Ireland are I contend the wealth of the nation
They are there in war and peace and it is nothing but just and equitable that they should have more fair play when I am dead than they had before and it is the nation that must do it and not the landlords
Every man is a selfish man and why not the landlords as well as others
We want improvements on our crops aud also on our houses
W are living all through the country in hovels and not houses
The blame of it lies on the landlord laws
I dont say it is on the landlords but on the landlord laws
If I had been a landlord I am not sure but I should be as bad but there should be proper laws
No
Yes
No
I have to complain of the high rents and want of pasture
Mr Bruce of Whalsay and Mr William Irvine is factor
No he lives in Edinburgh a young boy
Yes he has property at Ness
Bruce of Symbister
About  I think I could not exactly say how many
 I think
Yes
 s for  acres of land
Bare rent and the taxes vary from s to s
I have paid  s and I have paid  s
The latter is the highest I have paid and the former the lowestthat is in twenty years
It was in  that the land was planted and overrented
I can keep two cows and a quey in winter
No
No sheep
No I have to buy six bolls of meal in the year
Four of a family
No mine is one of the least
Mine is the biggest unless one I think in the island
I think so
I think I have a worse place than some and a heavier rent
Some have better places and less rent
Yes
Yes
No but in the same town
I have been just once shifted
s or s for three merks of land
I could not do that
It was more but we were on a different system then we were going to the fishing and getting a very little for the fish and had a very low rent
Then when the land was planted we got an overrent to pay
Yes
Yes
Yes if there was any over but there never was very much over
I cannot say they were sobut if they are better now it is owing to the people getting their eyes enlightened
I think so
Messrs Irvine Hay  Co
Yes they are indeed
Yes
They give as good prices as another
Yes every man has a share in his boat
I suppose if Hay and Co own the boat they get halfcatch but generally the men own the boat themselves
I am too old a man to go I dont go in the boats
Three years
I have two
One of them lives with me but I am obliged to him or I could not live
Yes the full rent and the seathold taken off from us
It was taken off for the sheep farm on the island half of the island is taken off for that and so
No half the scathold is taken off from them
Yes
From his father the minister of Bressay
Yes
That is our grievance I have to complain of and I have no place to tether a cow in and cannot have a drop of milk
Very near not one in the town has more than one cow and there are twelve neighbours in the town
Yes
I could not exactly say
Yes but he had not got it then
About  if I remember right
No Mr Shepherd was the first there as a sheep farmer
I think about seven years
Yes he went south and took a far larger farm
Mr Hamilton I reckon is making as good a thing of it
No I am living on a small bare bit of land now for twenty years   acres of land for   s of rent
Three holdings
About that
No he keeps them lying for grazing sheep
Yes
The proprietor himself was badly when this took place and shortly after he died
He was not fit to manage the place himself and so he let it out to these gentlemen
I heard when Shepherd got it that he was to pay  but that might be true or it might not
Nothing like it
I dont think it
No it is greatly to our disadvantage for his sheep are on the heather of the hill and our sheep would eat it while his wont
His sheep never taste it
I believe it is getting no good
They met and sent delegates
I am not one I only wanted to come here to get a hearing if possible there are delegates here besides me
No but he wants a hearing
No
No but they want a hearing
Yes
We would require some compensation for our work
We are all fishermen and we spend part of the best time for fishing in procuring peats
Twentyfour days we calculate it takes to bring eight months fire from Papa Little and Aithness and that during the best part of our fishing time
Yes or to receive compensation for it in some way from the proprietor
If we spend our time carrying peats to the island we lose our fishing and if we lose our fishing we cannot pay our rents
There is little or nothing now it is all scalped bare and that has cleaned all the sort of pasture we had
We take about four months burning from a part of the island and about eight months from the other place we transport from 
I cannot exactly say
Thirtysix
Yes some more some less
I could hardly tell you four or three or perhaps not three in some cases
I was just removed to one there last season and I cannot tell you exactly
About the same size but it is inferior in quality
I removed of my own accord to try and better myself
I have three different times removed on the ground of the same proprietorLady Nicolson
Yes
No betterment yet
Yes
In some cases other tenants on the same proprietors ground got them and others were laid waste
It is occupied now but at a reduction of rent
Yes and I think about onethird of the people on the place have left on that account
They could not do with the fuel in the island without some from other places
No not without some of the better quality of fuel along with it
I cannot exactly say
No it is near about out altogether
Yes
Hardly
Mr Thomas Adie
No
It is not possible to do without it
It is
None nearer that they could have
Yes but none nearer or more suitable
None that I know of
Yes at present but some have only a few and some none
There was a rule a few years ago
It did not stand it was laid down but did not stand
The tenants just got their will the same as before
No
Yes
Yes if it were carried out
Yes those that had the stock put them on again and the others had not the ability to raise the stock
Yes it was after that when they wished to go back to the old rule
Yes
I could not tell you but the tenants wish to have it back again
It is a sheep farm
William Humphray crofter
Perhaps he was helped by the factor Mr Thomas Adie
He was a fisherman and crofter before
He did not have it of himself
Yes they went to Mr Adie and wished to have it as it was before but it was not granted
I could not tell that
I keep two Shetland milk cows one quey one calf one pony and about ten sheep and that is as many as can be kept on an average on the island
That is about the average of what can be kept some have none at all and some have double treble or quadruple that
There is a difference in the rents of the crofts but they all pay the same for the scathold there is no difference with respect to that
Partly and partly to not being able to begin they cannot take any sheep from the mainland on account of the sheep disease it is clearing the island
Scab
In some places it is
Always to some extent
Oh yes
Very likely it does but I cannot tell we are not using it
We are not troubled with it
Yes
Not the same
Perhaps some of them are aware of it
Just themselves
Yes
Yes there are some through Shetland but I dont know much about them
No I never heard that they did
 s
I think about four acres as far as I can learn
Yes I have been on four farms belonging to Lady Nicolson and I have got very little compensation for building a house  feet by  feet by  feet  inches  built it and left it without getting anything
Yes out of the quarry
I asked for it once and got a denial and I never asked again
For the most part
Yes
They think they may be better at one place than another
Some years there is not any change and some years there may be three or four shifting about
No there is hardly one to be seen
Yes there were plenty at one time but there is scarcely one now
I dont know perhaps they have lost their course or have been killed
No
Yes
It is a fine fishing place
All the inhabitants are fishermen and they dont wish to leave the island
We can hardly state that at present
Yes the whole ground is divided by the lairds a march is laid out between the properties
Voeto Mr Adies place or to Walls
No
There are two posts which come across every week in summer and one in winter
He has a small croft only he has a sheep farm along with it
About  was the rent
I cannot toll you
No
No
I could not tell you
He has a good stock on it of small sheep
It is at the North Ness
No
It is all the pasture in the island now
That was the northeast part his was where Mr Adies station is
No it would not do
Wr would need to cure our peats ourselves if he could put them on the island to us clear of labour
We would like if he put them on the island and then it woidd not take our time from the fishing
Yes clear of expense
No there was a tenant on it but it is under sheep pasture now
Mr Dickson
Yes
He has the island of Lunga and Vementray
It would be of no use as pasture unless we had it altogether
Falling off
The crofters are all leaving it on account of the want of peats
Yes
Yes
It is on the east side and we are on the west side
Probably I cannot tell you
I was only once ashore
None that I know of only this place where we cut peat
Yes
None on the island
None that I know of
No
The crofters themselves
They have had what we call the horse disease
No
Yes it wont affect the sheep so far as I know
No
Dry stones
A wood and earth roof
Yes
Yes
Yes in some cases they will get the chance to do it
In some places and in some places I left it
The tenant who came in paid for it
Yes
Yes
I could hardly tell you we never put any value upon them
Yes
There are plenty others but none belonging to the same proprietor
Sandness Voe
Yes
Mr Scott of Melby
Yes plenty but I suppose they are far up from the sea
Most part from Sandness Voe
Yes
Yes
Mr Adie
There is a good fishing Station and plenty of room for more
White fishing and herring fishing
To the west
Yes sometimes far out and sometimes not very far
Yes with the small boats and in summer with big boats
Yes
Yes
Yes but not altogether
To Sandness
Mr Adie
None
We will leave that to the management
For the reduction of the rent do the peats put over as I stated
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
No I dont suppose we could
I dont think we could manage
Yes
Yes
There was one but it has gone down now a Methodist chapel
No only one
There is a new school which they are commencing to build just now
Yes
Yes
There is one in the parish of Walls
Six miles and a mile across the sound
Yes we very seldom see him
He comes but not regularly
I dont think there are any
None at present that I know of
Yes there is great need for a doctor and very poorly we are served with him
Walls
Yes
Not very numerous
I am not able to fix the precise date
I think it is just about as old as the century
Under the influence of the late brothers Robert and James Haldane
Yes
Not in immediate connection but pretty close
Scarcely
They are very nearly amalgamated but there are some slight differences
Not at all
There may be individual cases of assistance in building churches but there is nothing done systematically
No certainly not

Since
Yes
Yes
Yes I think it has
The improvement is slow but I think it is visible
Yes
Yes I think so
I think it is better on the whole
I think they have improved considerably in morals since I can remember
No not as a rule
There have been some cases in the island but it is not general
No
Well I think it has always been much the same as it is
Not at all
I dont think it is felt to be a grievance
I dont know what they feel
No the young men here mainly go to sea
They go south and take service
No only lately
There were very few going south when I remember first but they go very largely now
I could not say
Some of the men that go to sea improve their condition very much and a number of them become masters mates and officers
I am not so well acquainted with the circumstances of the young men in regard to that
I dont think there is a great deal of improvement
There has been
There was the Parochial school and others were got up by private individuals or by public subscriptions
I dont remember that there was any other fixed school but that of the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge at Esha Ness
Yes a number
Yes but some have a considerable distance to go still
I think there are some that have fully three miles to go and the difficulty is increased by the want of roads and the existence of burns over which there are no bridges
And in the winter time the children are not able to go through the marshy ground without wetting their feet and being exposed to danger by afterwards sitting in school during the day
That has a considerable effect in lessening the attendance at school
Yes they are naturally morally disposed
I cannot say I do
Yes they do there may be individual cases of falling off and neglect but the people generally attend
I think it is possible some advantage may be reaped by the people from this Commissionat least I hope so
The principal matters of complaint have been referred to beforethe system that prevails beteen landlord and tenant the tenant at will systemthe tenant may be turned off on forty days warning
Then there is no compensation for improvement and that having existed from time immemorial has almost blotted out the disposition to improve and consequently improvement has almost stopped
There are a great many improvements which might be carried out if there were fixity of tenure and compensation for improvements
That grievance I think is universally felt throughout the Shetland Islands
The existing state of matters is not owing to the present proprietors or factors it has always been the same
At every reference I make to improvement I am met by this that they have no security and no prospect of compensation and the result is that the people spend many days in idleness when they might be improving their small crofts and making them better for themselves and the people
I think they would do a great deal which they dont do now
I am aware of that
I think a lease for nineteen or twentyone years
That would be settled according to the other conditions of the lease
Sometimes the one and sometimes the other generally the landlord if it is any great repair
Yes generally
To some extent but not upon a large scale
No not what may be properly called evictions none since I came to the parish
No
There have been some proprietors laying down grazing parks but generally speaking some provision has been made for the tenants
I would very much like if there was a right understanding about that at present there is no proper understanding about it
The people have always had the right to the pasture here and that has not been interfered with but in other parishes it has been taken from the people and there is still an understanding that they have a right to it and that creates a great deal of heartburning and dissatisfaction and makes the conditon of the people worse than it would otherwise be
There have been some questions about that but the conditions are tolerably satisfactory
One thing however is that the people do not know how long the existing state of things may last and no doubt a better arrangement or distribution might be made
There have been several questions put about the dissatisfaction of some of the tenants with regard to others having stock on the hill pasture and not allowing them the same chance and some better arrangement about that should be made
I have not because although I have conversed with the people about it they have never suggested anything that might be an improvement but I should think and I have suggested to the factor himself that if so many sheep were allowed the tenant for each of rent the tenants who have more might be taxed for their over stock
That they should pay so much for the sheep
In some places in Shetland the people pay as much as a shilling per head
It might be for ought I know
I think something of that kind would be judicious and right
At the present time there is a misunderstanding on the subject It seems to stand in this way the tenant is very apt to look at it from the custom which has existed from time immemorial
When for instance you see advertisements of land to be sold it is spoken of as so many acres or merks of arable land with the right of so much hill pasture
The hill pasture is not properly bought but it enhances the value of the arable land and from time immemorial the tenant has held the arable land and so much hill pastureit may be mentioned or it may be not
It was not paid for per se but it was held under scathold and was held to enhance the value of the arable land
Now in many cases it is taken from the tenants and they are told they are to pay for nothing but what is within the arable land
They dont believe that and hence the heartburning and dissatisfaction which prevail
That does not exist here but nobody knows how soon a change may take place
I have heard that
I dont know
I believe in some places it is something like a superstitious fear that it will take away the luck but I am not aware of that existing in my own neighbourhood nor do I think it exists in this parish
I think any person here would sell to anyone else whether a neighbour or not
I have no doubt of it
But I have known places in Shetland where the people would not do that
I think however that superstition is passing away mostly everywhere
That I believe arises from the depravity of human nature
No certainly not
No not so far as I know
They do nothing so far as I am aware
That is a thing which I think the proprietor should put right
They may speak about it but there is very seldom any interference upon his part
No I dont think there is
Yes
That is what I mean
And therefore their state is not satisfactory
It is not satisfactory
At a complete stand still
Yes
I dont think so I can hardly tell the reason
No I rather put it upon this that they are anxious to improve their conditionmore anxious than they were perhaps fifty years ago
I do not think it is overstocked
They generally find the remedy for overstocked pasture in a severe winter
Yes
Yes
Yes that is the worst of it
Yes there is inequality and there always must be for various reasons
Yes I should like some definite fixed thing
I think so
I dont know that the additional rent would be very acceptable
I think their rent is generally as high as it should be
Matters are very different indeed from what I remember in that respect
There is a greater equality now than there used to be forty or fifty years ago
Yes as regards equality and stock on the pasture
Far more but the difficulty would be to get that settled
Yes
Yes it is very largely
Nearly nine years
Yes I took up business about that time
Yes
Everybody who will give me custom
Very much
Generally I have the general turnover is much more
It depends very much on the season I mean on what they earn
Iu a prosperous year like last year or any year that is prosperous in crops or fishing they pay well but as a rule I dont allow debts to get into my books
No
I think so as far as our district is concerned they are very much improvedvery much better off than they were a few years ago
I do not mean that although I daresay their tastes advance with the advancing times
We dont encourage the sale of useless or showy flimsy articles but as a rule I think their tastes are improving that way
Much about the same I think
I daresay I could sell a good deal more bakers bread if I would but I dont waut to do that I think it would encourage laziness
I do
The most of the grain in this parish is oats and to counterbalance that they buy fully more wheaten flour than oatmeal
But we give them their choice
I think the people should not be left always to themselves in that respect
I think if temptation be put in their way they may be induced to buy what they dont require
We are all exposed that way perhaps
Yes I buy Shetland wools and sometimes other wools and I sell the Shetland wool which the women knit up
I dont sell any kind of cross
In speaking of other wools than that and Shetland I dont mean foreign wools but wool of Cheviot crossed with Shetland sheep
It is our interest always to put the finest wools into hands for knitting the underclothing
I have a trade similar to Mr Anderson in ladies and gentlemens underclothing and shawls and it is to our interest to put soft wool into the knitters hands
I also do a small trade in home spuns
There is really no soft and pure so valuable as the Shetland
Sometimes crossed Cheviots and Shetland blended together
No not so much as there used to be but there is a fair demand for it yet
Yes I may say they make by spinning the wool more than the merchant does
They get the wool at a certain price and the rougher kind of wool is much cheaper it is d to d per lb cheaper
d to Is per lb
Cheviots crossed with Shetland
About d per lb
I buy the best for about Is d and Is d and retail it again at Is d
I think I do because there have been two or three instances of it around our place
I know a case of two girls who support a grandmother and one child
They have been able to live entirely by their handicraft and live well too in a room
They support themselves their grandmother and a little boy
There are some articles that pay them better than others but I should say that women who wrought anxiously would make from Is to Is d a day
In the class of goods we deal in here
I dont think she would
There are certain women who have finer hands than others and who cau do better knitting people who do homespun cannot do the finer work
Yes
I did not come here intending to make any statement I have no complaint to make
I am not aware of any
I think generally speaking the people in North Mavin are better off than those of any other parish I know of in Shetland
I cannot say I hear many
It is mentioned now and again in poor years or when their earnings are not much and they have hard times and have to pay their rents but in prosperous years they dont feel it
I think I have not heard any complaint at all
There is however one thing I could wish to state and that is with regard to the Shetland crofters generally and those of this parish particularly if the crofters had continuous use of the scathold or commonty as they are allowed here and if they continue to get the privileges which they have now with leases and compensation for outlay I think that is about all they require
As it is there are large bounds of commonty in this parish because the population is scattered along the seashore
I dont know if any person could really tell the number of square miles of commonty here and any person can keep as much stock as they like and can attend to
The number is restricted very much according to what they can attend to in winter they drop off in winter if they cannot attend to them I mean with regard to sheep or poniesand of course an  active farmer will have more than a man who is not active
Well in some parishes the scathold have been withdrawnin most of the parishes indeed and the proprietors have put palings round them
Restoration to those from whom it has been taken
We holdthough we may be wrong that the peasantry in Shetland had a right to the scathold and that the landlord have no right to take it away
Much better it would equalise the ownership of the general prosperity
Quite so no crofter can complain of his being excluded if he is excluded it is want of being able to place stock on the commonty
That is my opinion
The crops were only fair but the fishing was very good and I think last year was a good season in this parish
No special failure the potatoes were almost a failure
Very important on account of the shore fish always to be caughtfish can be caught all the year round and the potatoes are an important crop because the fish and potatoes make an excellent article of food
Very well when there are sunny seasons
They are not so thrifty that way as they should be but the most intelligent portion of the population do and the merchants so far as I know are very open to give them help that way
It always is so in my own little farm
I change the seed and bring it in fresh and I find the crops better in potatoes and also in oats
I cannot speak definitely about that
It is not the lace shawls we do here it is wraps and warm underclothing
Unst and Lerwick
It goes up and down according to supply and demand I think there is still very good sale for the finest class of shawls
I cannot speak definitely with regard to the fine shawls but so far as it has come under by observation I think that it pays the knitters better to make the class of goods of which I spoke as being made here because I have noticed particularly that women can earn what I have stated when they work regularly at it
No we dont want that
Yes I would because there are one or two parishes where I can say with assurance they have lost their scathold and the crofters are in far worse circumstances
Yes generally
I do and also to the open competition amongst the merchants giving them every facility and the highest prices possible
Yes
The women who knit
Yes
Oh no
No
They pay for it with the goods they knit
Yes
The brown and murrait of various shades and the gray of various shades natural gray grown on the sheep are the most valuable
Just the same
Is d is only the picked stuff we sell to the women to knit with
No there are two or three enclosed places where there are a few blackfaced and Cheviot sheep
There is a small enclosure west in Esha Ness where there are a few and there is a sheep farm at Tingwall but the stock there are principally blackfaced
No it does not
It is about twentyfour miles long by twelve wide taking it at the extremities
Yes of the business premises and a small farm and so on
I pay about  I think of rent for the farm and I pay so much for the business premises
No
They were not so just perhaps or so liberal as I would have liked but that is more a question of pounds shillings and pence
I must say that I think the rent dear but I was no way bound to take it it was quite optional
To the crofter class
I just instanced them but there are more of the same class
There is a young woman who supports her mother in the same way and there are various other cases I could name
Yes
They are very industrious I think they do their part in the way of earning too
The greatest drawbacks is that there is very little employment for the men unless during three months of the summer and only occasional employment then
There are four months in the year when they have not much work to do
Nothing better than encouragement to work on their own crofts
A great many of their crofts are large enough but the proprietors might give them something to encourage them to work upon them
There is very litle work done on the crofts just now
That is what they say
They dont care about working to another but I cannot recall an instance where a man has spent a good deal of labour on his croft and been set adrift
I know the man but I do not know what he did to his croft
I am sure they would
I have expended about  simply because I had a lease if I had not had a lease I could not have done that and I would not
But I must say it has been with a sort of selfish end because it was with a view to help forward my own business while it was improving the land and I should think they would be of the same way of thinking
That is the great difficulty
I dont believe I could get an inch of ground to purchase where I should like to plant my business round the whole of Shetland
There may be spots to be got but not what would suit a business man or any very few
They are not in the market at all
I think it applies to the whole coast
It does stifle enterprise and retard progress very much
Very great indeed
There are facilities for leasing the fishing stations but there is a good deal of restriction about them
However a great many of them have been taken up
Yes
Leased under restriction
There might in some of the parishes but I dont think there would be much of that here in the case of the crofters
I cannot say I ever did not to such an extent as to strike me that it was a desire on their part
I do
No not in underclothing there is no power in the islands
No nor steam power
Intrinsically it is not so valuable but there is a superiority about it that takes the taste of the better classes and so the trade moves on
Yes we seek to place those goods in the hands of the people who can buy them as a luxury
The hosiery is a very limited trade
I think it has been extended as far as it can be made profitable
It degenerates when it becomes too much in other words when women get set on to work at it who cannot do it so as to produce more goods we find it does not do so well
I dont think so
Yes they have to get out door work in some shape or form
They have fuel to cure and carry and they have all got some farm work to do more or less and when their husbands are away at a distance fishing they have to visit them
It is the spinning wheel which is used
No
I dont know the machine by that term
I think I have seen my grandfather spinning tethers out of horse hair that way
But it is a very rough sort of yarn that should be spun that way
No not wool
That is the general belief among the crofters and tenantry
I daresay it is founded on thisthat some of the proprietors would have a difficulty in proving their titles to all the ground they assume they possess and another reason is that from time immemorial the people have had the use of it and it has been an understood thing that they were to have the scathold with the croft because the crofts could not keep theirfamilies without the scathold
Yes they do it appears that its name would imply thata commonty for the common people
It lies between the proprietor and tenant to properly define that
Say a small croft is vacant and that there are two or three applications fur it the factor naturally chooses the man who he thinks will suit him best
Rent was fixed very much according to the localitythat is its nearness to good scathold and so looking at it that way it would appear that the whole pasture was taken into account in fixing the rent
But generally speaking the rent is fixed according to the supposed value of the arable land in the holding
Yes
Yes it is the accepted understanding always
Yes and sometimes the scathold is too heavily stocked and nature rights itself by clearing them off
No I dont think sothat is a man without a croftno I dont believe that
But at the same time he is not prevented from keeping stock on the commonty either by the tenants or by the proprietor
Quite so so far as I understand
He is not
Very few
A few solitary cases
Chiefly a few solitary sheepa few solitary casesbut not to such an extent as to be taken notice of
I would prefer that but they cannot
Yes a fair share is certainly due to the merchants and open trade
Yes generally speaking they can go and do go to any merchant with whom they can make the best bargain or whom they prefer
It was
Yes last year except in one case they all had money to get
One of my boats crews the little open boats which are now despised carried away within a few shillings of  of cash after paying all expenses
But that was an exceptionally prosperous fishing
Nevertheless all the others had money to get
Yes the crew which had the best fishing
Just for the three months in summer of ling fishing
Yes it is
Shore fishcod and ling and tusk
Yes they go to the deep sea fishing in summer and lie at outstations and we take the fish from them and cure them at outstations
We salt them down and dry them in spring we take our chance of them
We would rather there was a fixed price all the year round but the fishermen wont do that
For instance the price of ling in spring from the men in large boats is I think about s a cwt and I would gladly pay that price to my men just now if they would take it
But I have no doubt they will get s or more when they settle
Yes
It is a feeling of confidence which exists between the men and the curer
Yes
It takes so much wet fish to make a ton of dried fish and the prices are calculated that way and the expenses of curing being taken off the men get much about what is realised
Sometimes a merchant has a small commission and sometimes he gets very little
But the men are not bound to deal so far as I know with any curer even during the summer months
For instance last season I had three open boats fishing at Vidian and I sent out a good many stores but it seems they required more and they purchased things from other people and I paid about  of cash to these men to clear them out with other places so that they might be quits with everybody for the summers work
Yes it was leased along with the premises
I can only speak at a guess it has never been measured by me
I should think the arable land is about sixteen acres perhaps and then there is pasture ground besides perhaps about fourteen or sixteen acres more
For my own convenience and keeping up a supply of milk and vegetables and also a pony for riding or driving
No we can grow very good early cabbages and turnips but it is not a growing district
But I am a working sort of man and cannot afford to spend time in fancy work
My neighbour our ministergrows very good strawberries in his garden
Yes all the ordinary vegetables used
No the proprietor dont do it but sometimes men who have some spirit and friends attempt to do it
Suppose a young man marries and dont wish to leave the country if he has a good will and good courage he may get a patch of ground and hill pasture and by and by work it into a very good croft but it is his own labour that does it the proprietors dont seek to extend the arable ground
In places there is a good deal of hill or common pasture that could be made good growing land by drainage and cultivation
There is no accepted claim from the neighbouring proprietors anything done in that way it is expected will be looked into at the common division of the whole scathold which is always held in abeyance as far as this parish is concerned
No
No
That is what Lord Napier has been asking about whether a man can get a piece of commonty marked out for him and be allowed to settle down on it and make it into a farm
For instance if a man wants an outset in Ollaberry and Mr Anderson of Hillswick chooses to give it him he may do so
Yes and the same way with Busta if it is near the township
Twentyeight years ago
It was an offset the man took and the house did not cost anything at all
He built it himself and put it up in the silliest fashion and I never could get it repaired since
At Delting in Roe
Two beastsa twoyearold and a young one
Yes I have a dozen sheep
No no horse
It is a very little bit of a spot
Very much but it did not signify
The late Mr Henry Cheyne was the chief trustee and it was taken in by the other neighbour at first out of the side of the hill and a piece given off on the place I occupied by Mr Gifford and they wanted to have it back and to build a sufficient dyke to hold off the sheep and cattle
But once they got the ground the dyke was never built at least so as to be sufficient
Yes he came in a few years before he is now dead and away
Yes there were two neighbours of them
No far more than I had and they had good land
Near about 
No there is none of them has a lease
Fifty head of sheep or thereabout seven head of beasts and two horses
The best quality of ground
There was some cultivation in it good dry ground it was better in quality than what was left to me
No except that they wanted to enclose it for sheep but Mr Cheyne did not know
There was no dyke built
No never sufficient
Yes I wanted to get out when the piece of ground was taken off but I could not get out I was told if I would sit still the rents would never be raised and I began to improve a little and added about a fourth ir to what was there and then they began to raise the rent and it was very discouraging
I cultivated a piece and added about a fourth to what was there
But there was no way to cultivate it was a rocky bottom rocks and heather
No I dont think it
No
I have just come to state my own case but I dont think any of my neighbours have anything to say
James Sandison and Gilbert Sharp
Yes thirtyfive years
No I am a native of Delting and came here in
Yes there are other proprietors
Gideon Anderson is the next largest proprietor
My brother who is in Ollaberry
Yes and there is Mr Cheyne of Tangwick and Mr John Cheyne sheriffsubstitute of Dundee Mr Anderson Ollaberry Mr Joseph Leask Lerwick and Mr John Harwick
John Harwicks is the smallest it has a rental of about  or 
Yes
Yes
He lets it out
Yes
s on the gross rental and s on the net rental
s on the gross rental but it will be s d this coming year
Rather increasing
We hope so
Yes we have five schools in the parish
There was an old parochial school which has been renewed
Yes one was handed over two or three years ago from the United Presbyterian Church at Ollaberry
Oh yes
Yes
Not so regularly as we would wish but the officer does what he can to get them out
No I think not
They are improving since the schools were built
It will
I could scarcely say the qualification is somewhat different
Oh yes certainly they are
Yes the buildings are the best in the parish
Yes there is Mr Lawrence Smith Mr Inkster and Messrs Adie and there used to be one Williamson and Hay  Co North Roe
There is nobody here but myself just now
I dont cure for all the people
They have six other curers in the parish at Stennes
Mr Inkster and Messrs Adie have each a station
Yes
I buy the fish from them
Yes but sometimes they get them at Lerwick
Yes the St Clair comes in here and that has been a great boon for us
No
Yes
I have the property at Ollaberry belonging to my brother I sublet that
Yes
Yes
Chiefly but there are a good many otherwise engaged
No only some
Yes they are quite at liberty to fish for whom they like
Yes I am glad to get as many of them as I can as long as they are content
Ling fishing principally
Yes it is a good station but the fishing stations for ling used to be at Stennes Hama Toe and  Roeness Voe
This is the first year we have tried it at Hillswick
Mostly within the bay and they have gone about fifty miles off right into the ocean
Not many
There may be a few individuals who have rooms
Yes who occupy rooms without land
I scarcely think they are overrented
So long as they have liberty of scathold I think they may do
There may be individual cases where the rents are too high
Yes
Yes that is true but then they are necessarily restricted because they can only put stock on in summer they could not live in winter if everybody put on as many as they could
Yes
Oh yes they sometimes do during snow they must either give them feeding or lose them
No
No he has not interfered yet
That is true
Yes I have heard that said I have heard a farmer of that kind express himself to that effect that he thought it would be a good plan if the proprietor restricted everybody to so many cattle or charged them for what they occupied
Yes for each head
Yes
Yes in considerable numbers
Mostly it is preferred by those who buy
I think so
Yes hitherto
I dont think that is my experience the refuse sort of stuff may be a drug in the market but not the good hosiery
In this district we only knit underclothing for ladies and gentlemanthat is the chief branch of the trade here
No
Yes we have always found that
Yes
Sometimes we sell them the wool
Sometimes we purchase it for them in order to supply them when they have run out of their own
No we dont like to buy it for hosiery
Yes
We pay Is d a pound for the fine wool
Yes a little
We have to pay a little higher for the coloured wooldark and light brown murrait wool
I can scarcely say
No they do it while they are carrying peats and walking about the road
Yes some of the women do
I dont know if they would be able to support themselves by their knitting they may have some other way of supplementing it
No I cannot say
I heard one of the witnesses speak about the roadsthat is a thing we are very much in need of
We have no roads from here all round to Asheness and Ollaberry to North Roe
And it would be a great favour to us if we had the telegraph
Voe eighteen miles from here
No
When the telegraph was extended to the North Isles and I spoke about extending it to Ollaberry and Hillswick and we were told they would do it if we got up a guarantee of  I wrote to a good many people who I thought might be interested in it and we got up a subscription of  and we were told it could not be done unless we got up 
I could not say
Yes or the Telegraph Company perhaps
I dont remember hi name
Yes
I think about d per lb
Perhaps
Yes I have some on my property
Yes
Yes the bulk in the parish
Some of them may have been crossed not to their advantage I dare say in regard to wool
I suppose so
No she goes to Stromness and then to Aberdeen and Leith
The chief cause probably is the number of lunatics that is the heaviest charge we have I think
Some are boarded in the south and others are kept at home
I scarcely think i t we believe that our paupers can be kept cheaper than by having a poorhouse
I scarcely think it members of the Parochial Board are so well acquainted with people in their different districts that they know their circumstances exactly
Yes a good many of them but we would be the better of a poorhouse in the parish where we could order the paupers home
We would be very much the better of that
I have not heard
I have no reason to complain
I have a lease but I think that want has generally been felt
Yes I think so
No I think not
I offered to give leases to my Ollaberry tenants to the extent of my lease
Some of them did and some of them did not seem to want it
There is only one gentleman has a leaseMr George Sinclair
Well I supposed he would be obliged to keep up the buildings
I think the proprietor should build it
I think so
I think I heard one ofthe witnesses say something about the prices of cattle
I think he was wrong in what he said the price of cattle has been very high this year
I think I heard him mention  or  for young cattle
I buy cattle and I have been paying from  to 
Two to three years old
Yes
Yes
I did not mean the refuse of the wool I meant inferior knitted hosierymurat
Yes it is it means a colour between brown and yellow
No
Yes it is maybe more common in one place than another because they may keep a murrait ram
Yes
Yes we have some crosses here between shorthorn and Shetland which makes a good cross
No
We kept a shorthorn bull for some time but they thought the cross breds would not be so hardy and did not take advantage of it
I think not because unless the animals are well fed they dont turn out well
I have land under my own management besideshere at Hillswick
Yes
The whole of it is sublet
I think there will be about fiftyseven crofters and the average rent is about  s
Yes I daresay the most of them are although I could not give the proportion exactly
Just as if I were proprietor to the end of my lease which expires I think in
None at all
I called them together when I first took the property and told them they were at perfect liberty to fish for me or any other person and that if they improved the land and kept the houses in repair and kept the fences up the rent would never be raised upon them and I have never raised it
None in the world
There are surely some who dont
I think there are more fishing to me now than there were a few years ago
Entirely by their own free will
Yes
Yes
Always at November
Always
None in the world
Yes and I think that is the case with all the curers in the parish so far as I am acquainted with them at the present time
I can only speak from hearsay and I have been told by the old fishermen that was the case
Yes I have been told that by the fishermen themselves
I am happy to say they are
No I think not because for all the fish we get to cure unless in the summer fishing we pay down ready money for all the fish that they catch through all the yearexcept summerwe pay them cash over the counter
Yes and spring
No
I cannot tell but I find it very much better for ourselves than to run an account for it
Yes that is so
Nothing except about a pier if we got any help with a pier here it would be a great benefit to the whole community and to the fishermen especially
Probably a pier extending for sixty yards or so would be a great accommodation
At present we have erected a sort of temporary wooden pier but we wish something more substantial than that
Yes cemented
No I think it could be done in the neighbourhood
Yes
I think about 
No and it is a great trouble to fishermen
Unless the pier was built substantially it would not stand
You see we are doing all we can as tenants and all we can afford to do it would come too heavy upon us to do more
I think the usual charge is  a year besides a royalty of something like d or d a barrel
Deep enough for those big boats but not for other purposes
Perhaps  yards
Yes
It is the most suitable place for the beach but I fancy the place where you saw the rocks on the right coming in
About six or eight feet when they are loaded
Yes that would do
The place the last witness referred to is a large portion of scathold which belongs to Lord Zetland and the rest to the Homeron property and Mr Ingram has another portion and another small tenant has another portion
Lord Zetland is getting no rent aud Homeron is getting none
If they are paying Mr Ingram it is he who keeps it
It is a piece of scathold that lies inside of two enclosures and is occupied by any person who wishes to go in
There are four proprietors in it
No I know Lord Zetland does not
Yes
It is taken into a sheep pasture
I could not say
I have over six acres of it
There are some of them here today
Some whom you have not spoken to
Tenants in the neighbourhood of where I am I refer to
Yes
It might be somewhere about  but now it would be more wages are higher now
I have never taken any contract to build a house of that sort but I believe a house of that kind would cost between  and 
I believe it would
Yes of course formerly it could have been done cheaper
From  to s or s a week
Twenty years ago s to s d a day
s to s a week
My little daughter copied it after I wrote it
Thirteen
I was assisted in doing some of it
Major Cameron
Mr Hamilton
No I think not
By Walker
We have three old cows and three young ones
Four old ones and three young ones
My father has no sheep but for the ponies and cows we have we are paying for pasture to other proprietors
None
On the scathold belonging to other proprietors which we have liberty to use
In the summer time we have a few of them on the grass
Yes sometimes two and sometimes three of them
 that is for the land we got at first but we pay more
Yes for the farm my father took at first
Owing to the number we have so much a head
For the hill pasture it is s
Back and forward just through the year we have it always in winter but just occasionally
From s to s they are only part of the year in that is in the pasture we are paying for now
Different proprietors who own the ground but we pay it to Mr Ingram
It is just enclosed pasture there are several proprietors who own it
Mr Ingram appears to be the man who takes the rent
No he is part owner
They have a few
About the grievance I hadthe want of scathold and grass in the meadow along with the farm
Major Cameron
Yes
No I think it is just the same
 s d including the poor rates
Fourteen years
I was not in the same farm then I paid  before
No none since I went to the property
Yes
Yes if I could
I had a farm from the same man at Woodwick
My croft was laid in a sheep farm and I was warned out of the place
One man in the same neighbourhood besides myself
The town was laid in with hill as a sheep farm
No more sometime before there were three but only two when I went
Yes
Yes
Very well
No I came of my own accord
I never beard of the inquiry until this morning and my neighbours  were all away at the fishing and never heard of it at all
All I have to say is that my rent is more than double what it was when I came to the property
Mr George Henderson Burravoe Yell
 s d and now it is  s besides road monev and poor rates
None at all
I came to this property at Martinmas  and he has lifted the rent three times since
Yes the same gentleman
Three
I could keep five cows I have no ponies
About a dozen head
There are seven neighbours and myself
Yes
Oh yes they would say the same
No they are not all the same
There is only one the same as mine but it was all a general lift at the same time
We have the hill property we have it as we had it before
Yes far more
No in Yell
He wont lower them a bit that is his talk
Yes
I dont know
It has been paid in time past
I have been a fisherman up to this year but I am not fishing this year
I had very few of a family
Oh yes
Four bolls of the meal
But I had no family worth mentioning
I have only three of a family
Some years I had hardly anything to buy at all
I cropped the whole of it this year
This year I am giving up a lot of it
No my wife died last year and I had to give it up to one of my neighbours
No I cropped it
No there is a great failure in the potatoes
Just about the same
About southand bywest
It takes about an hour to go to Burrafirth from our place
Yes
This year only four boats
I dont know they are leaving and going into big boats
No
There is a great current outride and it is a wicked place to get into
Some to Burrafirth and some come here to Mr White
Yes
Yes
No they are not fit
When they come to fourteen they are not caring whether they go to school or not
But the schoolmasters are not caring the children are desired to go to school when they are not fit and when they are fit the schoolmaster dont care whether they go or not
I think they are not fit for much schooling before they are seven or eight years old
Yes for they are not fit when they are so young to travel through the snow without roads
There are places where there is no road at all nothing but wild moors
We have to get them from Balta Sound
On our backs
Some have them but a great many have none
Yes but there are no ponies in our place except two belonging to one man
Yes those who have big farms
We delve it all with a spade
No
Generally
Only the proprietor has split every farm in two to increase it for fishermen and that has made the holdings far too small
He did cure but he has given it up now
About ten years ago
No but it was raised before that
Yes several times
I have had to buy for some time but when I was selling it I got d and d and Is a pound
Last year we were paying Is d and s for good wool
No for Cheviot wool
I know it has been sold for Is d
It was cheaper
Yes but this year I dont know what it is
I bought some from Mr Hamilton this yearblackfaced wool
No not blackfaced wool
Cheviot wool is cheaper this year Mr Edmonston has been selling it at Is
I never bought any of it
I sent it South and got stuff made with it
Yes
I could not say I have not settled for it
I could not tell he is here
Well Mr Edmonston sold some Cheviot wool this year for Is
I think it will be about d per lb for blackfaced wool
Yes
No it is not adopted for that it is heathery hills
No
Yes but Shetland sheep are the hardiest
They are generally kept until we cannot keep them longer
The greater part of them died of old age some time back we keep them until they are eight or ten or twelve years ago
They were always kept for their lambs and their wool
Just one neighbour to the other
s for a Shetland ewethey thought that a good priceand s and s d for a lamb
They could be somewhat dearer
I have seen them sold at s and s
No
No
I do not know I am sure blackfaced sheep are things we are not much used to we have always had the old Shetland sheep
Yes
His is a farm laid down for sheep
I dont know
It would be if we had only the property to raise them on
Yes Mr Edmonston
They are hardy animals
Because the wool of them is awful coarse
Yes I  should say the one would pay up what the other wanted
I could not get it managed I could not get people to work because they are getting scarce
I told it off to my master
Yes
I do not pay the half now because I am not using the half but I only have it for one year
No I am going to give it all up because I cannot manage it
 do not know
I will have to try and go to another country
No a bare man has no need to take a farm now unless he has a family
None have got leases at all
About s I think in the 
For poor rates and school rates
Yes
Yes and we pay d in the for road money and there are no roads at all
There is in the island but not to our place
A couple of miles
Yes
Yes
Five miles
The Shetland wool is said to be the best the softest
Yes a great many of them used to have it but now they cannot get it manufactured in this island
There are no weavers in this islandnot one
No unless working stockings and shawls
No
Here amongst the Shetland people themselves
The men
Because I had not enough of it
I bought blackfaced and mixed it and that made it at least a little better
Yes
Seven
They always were in the winter but not much in the summer
Some of them died and some gave it up
No d a yard was what they charged and that would not pay them
s last year
Yes
Yes he has been there these last fifty years
Major Cameron
I am in the same position as the man who has just been examined
I am in want of scathold
It was taken away and they put  upon the rent they took away the scathold and never took off the 
They kept sheep more or less perhaps fifty or sixty sheep and some maybe had fewer
He kept about twenty sheep but some people had more
There was  put upon the land when Mr Walker came and looked over the scathold he raised the rent  on account of the stock picturing and then he took away the scathold and the  was never  taken off
Three cows and six ponies
No sheep
Yes very good it has just been repaired
 altogether
The ponies that I have I am obliged to other people for letting them go upon their land outside
I received the intimation at the telegraph office on Saturday or Sunday sometime
I could not say which
I heard on the afternoon of yesterday that you were to be here today
Yes either Saturday or Sunday
Mr Sanderson the postmaster told me yesterday
About three hours
Last Monday
It was represented then that you would not be here until the th
It was the directors of the place the minister and two or three others
No it was reported you were to be on the th at Balta Sound
About twenty people
Yes and other proprietors
Dr Paul
The Earl of Zetland
Yes there are different people but these are the big proprietors
Those who have a dozen farms and so on
Three I think Dr Paul Major Cameron William Paul and the Earl of Zetland
I do not know
Yes but they are all busy at the fishing
This other man who is along with me is at home and I was at the fishing but they let me off so that I might come along with him
That would have been much better but likely enough it was overlooked
The grievance on Dr Pauls property is that he wont repair their houses
I think he has come to pretty fair terms with them there is no grievance
Yes the want of scathold
That is the northwest wind which brings the sand in and made the place all waste and the sea has got possession of what was fertile land
The people may not be up to that
Maybe a very little
Yes but the sea has got possession it runs in over the land more than it did formerly
Herring fishing now
Very good
But there is no season there we fish here at Unst at Uyea Sound
Yes at the west side of the island
Yes we have got none of our own but we hire them and fish on the halfcatch system
Yes
Seven of us
Yes
William Paul
Yes
Yes he owns the boat and we give him the fish and we get half the fish for our trouble
Yes he keeps the boat in working order and gets half the fish
Till September
Yes we gave it up on th June
Yes from the month of March
Just work at the land through the winter and repair the fishing material and when it is weather good enough to enable us to go off to the fishing we go in fouroared boats round the shore
No the farthest is a mile
Cod principally
No about  or  cwt in a day
Yes we have dealt with him this while back but now the Scotch curers are coming into the place they are getting their eyes opened
Yes
If you have no money your curer has to supply you
Once a year when the fishing is doneabout Martinmas
We get  a cran from the st of Augustfor  crans we get  a cran and for any over that we get s a cran
We have from the start  crans at s then for any above that s to st August and then we get  for  crans and for any beyond that quantity s if we get that many
Yes before
No not for us because we are not able to buy a boat
Yes
 crans is considered a very good fishing but of course they sometimes make more than that
We cannot tell
We have got  crans already and we may get  or  or  more and perhaps not
Before it commences we get a written agreement to that effect so that it cannot be broken
No you dont require to take stores from the curer unless you like
Yes and of course at his price
Yes
Yes
Yes
At the same time as the herring fishing the new year before the season begins
We get s d for cod s d for ling s for tusk and s for halibut per cwt
They ice them
We get s for them up to the th May
Birmingham and Leeds and London
Scotch people call them halibut but we call them turbot
It is long
Yes pretty heavy upwards of a cwt
Yes
Yes
Yes we have nothing to do but take off the heads and in the case of turbot we dont even do that
We do not split up the fish
We use them for our own purposes
We get the fish and take off the head
We keep that for our own purposes or the curers buy them
They buy the sound
Yes the liver and head but not the sound
Nothing whatever
I believe it is of course I could not say as to Scotch curers
They give better prices to a man who has a boat of his own
Perhaps they have a better advantage
But I can only speak from my own experience and I have told you what our curer gives
Oh yes
No not many there is just one crew who have been able to get a boat of their own
Yes they may be mere expensive but there would not be so much loss of life as with the old boats
Yes very much the small boats were merely skiffs
Yes but there is no mistake a big boat would live where a small boat would not
Yes
From the th of June to the st of August
Yes and perhaps you might get that in two weeks and if you got more you got s a cran
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
They are more valuable they are full they are considered to be in their prime
Yes
They are considered better anyhow
Generally the best they consider the herring at their best
We expect so
Yes
No
No some of them have them two of Dr Pauls tenants have
I could not tell you none that I know of
No I do not think there are that many in North Yell
No they are upon other estates
Yes whole towns have been laid in sheep pasture
Yes Westa Firth
Major Cameron
Kirkabusta on the Cameron property also
Windhouse in Mid Yell
Granister and Garth
That is all in one enclosure now  there are fences dividing it
There were a good lot pretty nearly twenty houses on Westa Firth alone
No but that is the biggest place
No I was too young
Yes they were well off they had plenty of scathold and sheep
They all removed some went to other countries and some removed to other farms
They had to go one here and one there  could not say where they went to
Yes
There is no tenant but the shepherd
Yes so far as I know
Yes
Yes they are very good Major Cameron has very good houses upon his property
I believe so but they are all down now
Yes all built of stone
Yes it was a considerable loss
They made clothes at home they spun wool with yarn and it was woven with machines which they had for the purpose in Shetland
It was eaten
Three or four years of age the wethers were generally used at that age and the ewes older
Generally eaten because the prices were low and they thought it better to eat them than to sell them
Nothing unless a pig
I dont see any reason why they should not give us a little of it
Yes
The correct one is that the tenants upon Dr Pauls property have a little scathold and Major Camerons tenants have none
No they all have a little scathold
That is it
Yes undoubtedly they do require more scathold if they would only give it to  them
Yes
No the cash is paid the night you settle
In general the fishermen are due money to the curers
Yes in a good many cases they have a little to get
They are getting better on now the big boats get more money
Twenty years ago Shetland was very poor
The prices have been fair within the last five or six years
Before that the curers did not give fair prices because the people could not make a better of it
Oh yes they would not hold you to fish to them if you could purchase a boat for yourself
You could go to any curer you liked and get privilege and bounty too
Yes at any rate none of Major Camerons tenants would be disturbed on that account
He has let them fish wherever they liked
Herring
Yes when you dont catch herring you dont set lines
The small boats use musselbait but the large boats dont
No they always get some bait if they want it
Yes
I think he does not compel them if they have a boat of their own
No because he has no fishing boats but merely the boat of another proprietor
If you have a boat of your own you can go where you get the best price for the fish
I think they are all pretty well satisfied
The curers give their goods pretty cheap supposing you dont have money to pay for them until the fishing is out
Considerably better
Even twenty years back in my mind the people were very poor and within the last halfdozen years they have got considerably up
People from the South and curers have come and given good prices for fish and of course the curers in Shetland have to give the same as the Scotch curers
No I believe every one just gives what he thinks he can pay generally however they have some such agreement as we have
Yes
Yes on the night of the settlement
Yes these are the ones I know and there may be some of whom I dont know
Yes they are because if they improved the land perhaps when they had no leases they might be turned out next day and the croft taken from them indeed if they improved the ground the ground was taken from them
No I do not know
Yes they fish for him but if they had a boat he would not hinder them from going to any other curer they liked
Not many he has not many tenants
No they all fish to him
Yes if he gives them as good a bargain as others
Yes where they can make the best bargain
Yes very few just two in North Yell
Yes
Just the same
The proprietor and if you had any money to get he would give it to you
No
No they give the general price of the country
Yes they are improving greatly
Yes
Yes their parents are poor and they have to go and work for themselves
Yes if they can only work
Nearly four years
No
My father was a gardener
South Shields
My wife is a Shetlander and I came with her and her brother to Shetland and we started business together in West Sandwick and then removed from there to here and dissolved partnership
Yes since
Yes but there were a great many drawbacks that kept us back
Certainly
General goods of all kinds
They do
They pay better
They do
It has
Since I came to Shetland this is my second removal from a yearly tenancy
At Martinmas  I was removed from this place after offering  for the place
I paid  before
I was the sitting tenant and I offered the same rent and the same security as the man who came after me but I had to be removed
I had to build a shop for myself and lie out of business on account of these removals
It almost ruined me
I furnished the place
I had an hotel licence and my furniture was lying in the manse after I was in the place a year
I did that but they would not give it
I got it from Mr George Hay of Lerwick a different proprietor
No I was promised a lease once the shop was built and the shop was built for a little more than  and he charged me  more than the place paid before for the  of outlay
They built the shop I paid for the building but they afterwards paid me
In full
Tenant at will and sixmonthly rent
I cannot tell
I was certainly promised a lease from Mr Hay but he has not fulfilled that promise and there are a great many drawbacks
I have no pier and I am agent for the Earl of Zetland and for the Steam Navigation Co
I have to wade into the sea in carrying out my duties as agent for the steamer while if I had had a lease I would have improved the place and built a pier for myself
But how could I do so and be turned out perhaps at the end of the year
The drawback is this that if we do improve we have no certainty of getting anything for improving and we are tenants at will which is a very wrong thing
In addition last year I had  worth of goods and what was I to do with forty days notice in a place like Shetland
I have three fishing boats and men to supply and it wont do for me to be without stock especially here where we only get the steamer once a week
We have but we have not got accommodation where we can telegraph for an article and have it in the shop by the next train
Perhaps the steamer leaving Lerwick may miss the south steamers goods and in that way one may miss his stuff
I cannot get goods the same as in the north of Scotland or England
The summer before last we had only two posts in the week and in winter only one
I think in summer now there are three
I do
I do
Yes if we keep away from the poorer classes plenty of them are not able to earn anything
There are a great many feeble old people
Commonly we have to give it from year to year we cannot help it although it is safe enough
Crofters are not like people getting in money every day
They cannot sell stock more than once a year
They cannot get money unless they sell stock and if you push them for money they have to sell their stock at a disadvantage perhaps
General goods and drapery and groceries and I buy hosiery
Meal and all
Yes
Those who require money are paid in money some require goods and some will take part goods and part money
That is the way commonly but mostly now it is cash
No material change since I came here
I believe so but that was before my time
Yes the price is the first thing asked for
I have
Yes
I believe that is so
There is little encouragement given by the proprietors
Not half
Yes
I offered  when the place was advertised
None given but a great deal taken away
I had a farm here and it was taken from the property altogether
Yes and a reduction of the farm
I am all but alive
It has almost been my death and nearly ruined me besides
There were six months I lay in a small place of  or  feet long and  feet wide by being thrown out and having no place to go to with my wife and children
And we had to take in  worth of shop goods with us
I did
Yes the whole way unless the small piece of property I am on belonging to Mr Hay
It belonged to the SpencesMr Robert Niven Spence but he died before I came here
It was sold then to Richmond  Co or Mr John Harrison the present proprietor
Mr Alexander Sandison
He does
Not exactly he is not interested in fishing personally
Perhaps he is interested for the proprietor for all I know
Yes the same as I had
It is
I dont know  I believe it would have been in our favour if it had
I know for a fact it would keep many a shilling in my drawer which I have to pay out
I have sixteen or eighteen fishermen in my boats and when they come ashore they want money to get drink and let the fishing be good or bad I have to give it to them and it comes to be a drain upon me
 with taxes
I pay it to them
No I am not a loser if I am certain of it at the end of the season
Yes
Not so much as I could stand upon outside my door
The house was formerly  and I was to have a lease the rent was put down at  for the house and  for the shop
The cost of the shop was a little over 
I pay for grass and keep one cow for the sake of my children only
Otherwise I would not keep a cow at all I have no place for it
Twenty shillings a year
I have to purchase stuff
Perhaps about  I paid it last year
I have the use of the hill during the whole year but there is scarcely any grass in winter
The cow goes to get the air
It does
Yes
I could not get it to buy
It is
Yes and more if they could get it
Sometimes they have no milk at all
There are some large families and sometimes it is late before the cow calves
They purchase syrup in spring sometime in the spring of the year the cattle are not able to rise owing to want of food
No they are in the byres
Yes a thing which is unknown where I belong to as the cattle are better fed
I belong to Deeside  Aberdeenshire
Only one year
No but the fishing season then was not like what it is now
There was only one curer then and latterly there have been two
I am bound to a certain extent if the men have been out at the ling fishing for two or three nights it is necessary that they should have something when they come in and many a time at herring fishing the same thing occurs
But at the same time I will not say that it is necessary just now in the herring fishing season
Not so much now as in the dead of winter
No
For the convenience of the men
Many a time I do but still I cannot help it
Yes that is the late proprietor
He told me my offer would be as good as that of any one else but I found it was not
Yes but the farm was taken away
I t was put up that way and I offered  as it was advertised
Yes but it was less the farm that I offered
It was
Yes
Yes
To give a lease would be the best remedy and then when a mans lease expired he would know it was his duty to renew it or look out for some other place
No but I think the sitting tenant if his character is good ought to have the preference
I cannot say that I think it ought to have been a matter of law in this case
Forty days warning is not sufficient for a merchant in business
Yes I should say that in cases of yearly tenure one years notice should be given
No but there I would have got a store for my goods
I would make it a law in any country place in the case of a tenant at will especially in the case of a country merchant when he is liable to be turned out at forty days notice it is a very silly affair
Yes what would I do with my goods in Mid Yell
I would have to charter a schooner to take my goods out of the country
There is no store to put ones goods into
No I dont think that
The best way to prevent that is to give leases
Just so
I would have it fair on both sides
Yes I should say so
The present notice of forty days is too short
That would be a simple matter
Yes
That is so I might even have given  or  more rather than be removed I would suggest in addition to what I have stated that a workhouse should be erected in Lerwick or elsewhere
There are more paupers in the parish than ought to be getting a supply and that is at our expense entirely whereas in the workhouse women who can do any kind of work might bring in something which could be applied to the support of the institution
There are some I think but there are a great many on the poor roll who would be able to do something if they were energetic enough
I am certain they would not
One workhouse would be sufficient for the whole of the islands
Under the present system there is also the expense of keeping inspectors which would be avoided if a workhouse were erected
We dont have any satisfaction under the present system at all
About four merks
Near by that
Five cattle altogether old and young
Three
Half a dozen I think
 s exclusive of taxes
Generally about five months
There is a boats crew
Not at present
If times would improve
No very small
Only two at the present time but there are a good many employed in other boats
Pretty near about thirty
The most of them
Yes of course there are a few not
No there are a few of them over here but not many
Yes
Keep the ground clear and keep the weeds out of it and attend to the cattle
We dig it with spades
Yes
Both women and men sometimes
Yes we have the full privilege of the hill pasture along with the arable ground
Not at all we are much aggrieved for our small boundary and we are confined in our property
We would like a Government valuation we think our rent too high and we are confined in our holdings
Our land is lying in small patches twenty yards square and five or six tenants come in amongst these again and then we have another patch and we cannot have the benefit of it
The land is not in any one spot
Yes
Quite possible
Mr Basil Hastie Robertson
Mr Keith
Yes
The reply was that the land was to be laid out in lots and it has been done but we have never occupied it we have never had the privilege of occupying it
Yes and it was done but somehow or other it belongs to two different landlords there is a Mrs Robertson who owns some as well Basil Sinclair
She was the wife of the late Mr Robertson and she has a share in the property
I think so
Yes
That is what we cannot exactly understand because the proprietors apparently could not agree as the land was mixed
Our proprietor agreed that the land should be laid out in lots for each house by itself but the other proprietor interfered after that was done because in doing so they came to occupy some of his land
The houses were mixed in amongst the others and before the land could be laid out it interfered with the other property and he interdicted the proceedings
They are mixed
That is right
Yes
It appears so
Yes
Partly because the late Mr Robertson purchased some property which belonged to the Earl of Zetland and other parties and after his death his property was in the middle of the other property and it was heired separately
Yes and we have to suffer
Yes he has tried what he could but it never came to any arrangement
The land I am occupying belongs to one
Not all together
I have about thirty patches of it
Yes I am not sure of thirty but there are twenty at any rate
It is a difficult matter but we must give each other access
Not carts but wheelbarrows
Certainly
We have got a promise that it is to be arranged better in future but we have had that promise for the last three years and it has never taken place and we have very bad houses as well
Yes mostly
Six and sometimes five
There is only one crew purchasing a boat just now
One of these big boats costs from  to  new
Each net will cost about 
According to the size of the boatsome forty and some fifty
Yes some smack rigged and some lug sail boats
 to  tons of dead weight
Not this season but I have done it in former years
Because the herring fishing commenced earlier
Fairly as yet
Up till about the latter part of September
 crans would be a fair fishing and a good one  to  crans
Yes for ling and coda small place
A fine harbour only it is small
Heavy vessels could not very well come into it
Yes
Well the pier is very simple just now we can get into the pier at high water but only then
It would be easy to have a pier there and it would not be costly
Yes the piers here are always made of stone and wood
Some seasons we get a good deal and some seasons none
None
A few houses have the benefit of a little but only a few
We get turf
No not at all where the ground is deep
I lay down the surface and take from underneath that
I could not exactly say
I suppose there are about fourteen or fifteen situated in the same way
The late proprietor who died was the half brother I think of the mother of the present proprietor
Yes very distant relations
Yes several of us tried
Yes
We got a promise that it was to be done and in fact it was done but we never got the benefit
It was marked off how it was to be done
No we did once at the commencement
We have given notice through Mr Keith the factor and he has applied for us
No the cattle are by themselves
By an independent door outside
Yes I have heard of it but I have never seen it
No we have two small windows in the walls but there is a portion of the present house which was handed down to me as being  years old and nothing has been done to it since
No I have only been three years in my present house
They resided there not in the present houses but close by
I have about  acres in pasture

Yes
Yes
We have about eight cattlewinter stockand about forty sheep and we have some grazing cattle which go away in the harvest time
Five
About fifteen these are extra
In May
In perhaps three four or five months
Not as a rule but I might take in a beast from any one
It used to be about  for four or five months
I have not been long here only about two years
The mainland
Major Cameron
I had a crofta smaller one
It was better no doubt
I had to go away from there because they doubled my rent when the lease was out when I got a lease from Mr Walker he doubled the old rent and I thought I might have been better looked after by the major but he doubled it at the end of the lease too
Yes I got this one from Mr Joseph Leask who owns the whole of that west side
Yes
Fourteen years
I dont know what Mr Leask may do
I have a new proprietor nowone of the young men
The old man is dead
Well Mr Leask sorted the house but I have to keep it in repair he wont be at the cost of any building
No we have a canvas roof
Yes
Yes as a rule
Yes
No it was a turf dyke and would not keep out anything
No Mr Leask gave me the material and I have to pay the interest on that
Yes and our taxes are very heavy
 per cent on the whole cost of the fence
s and we are taxed on that interest
About s d in the pound I think
Half on us school rate and poor rate
I think about fifteen acres but it is in a miserable state all wet and he binds me to improve the land at that rept
No I have not so much to complain about now as I had before
We are charged so much a sheep for being in the scathold besides what I have mentioned
He charges d a head
Yes
I have none but other tenants have
They dont know about this meeting they are all away at the fishing and I would not have known of it had I not been over here working
I think the most they have to grieve at is the want of leases and rents being raised on them for improving
They dont raise the rent on a fellow who dont improve
I know some of them have got a good rise by improving
In olden times he might have gone on ten or fifteen years and perhaps have a new place at no rent and then perhaps they would get a rent of s or s according to what improvements had been made
That is the way my grandfather started the place I left
No but he lived in the place until he was  years of age
Yes from Mrs Mowat
They were not so ready to remove in those days there was no sheep farming
We were in it only two years ago when the major after I laid out  or  upon it doubled tho rent
My last lease in that place was fourteen years
I got it from Mr Walker
He would be I think factor and would have shares with Major Cameron in this sheep farming
They did and drove away the people they took the crofts wherever they could make the best sheep farms
A good many of them came over to Yell and North Maven and anywhere they could get a place
He doubled it at the end of the lease
Yes
I think s more than I was paying
He got the tenant in after I left
No
I would not have left it for a pound or so
Yes that was all he could get
No
Yes
Yes and I will do it I am so far bound to do it but I would do it without being asked to do it
Yes and I know the benefit of improving
Four rooms
Two above and two below
Yes
I could not tell exactly
It was repaired last year the walls raised and a new roof put on it
I cannot complain about the house
Yes the house is not bad
I could not exactly say
He was only at the cost of the wood and mason work I did the rest I put on the roof
Yes canvas tar wood and mason work
No not 
I think the whole thing would cost about  including my labour
Yes
Yes the most of them are at the fishing
I think somewhere from  to perhaps a little more say from  to  I know there are some as low as 
A good many I could not say exactly the number
Yes the proprietor owns the whole district with the exception of some small patches
No he stays in Lerwick
He is a merchant in LeithJ
B
Leask
He has a store or shop
Yes the people dont have many small boats now but he would get them big boats if they could only manage them
The cod and ling fish
I expect so
No I think the late Mr Leask bought it from the Braces
No he is north from there
Our neighbouring proprietor is on the Gossaburgh estateWest Sandwick
Yes
No I dont know where he is
I think a Mr Keith
Yes I think he is here
No he belongs to Caithness I think
There is some in East Yell and some in West and South there is a whole lot of it
I think so
Only those in the big boats
To the north
Yes I suppose so
Forty or fifty miles out I daresay in the summer time
As a rule they fish for ling too at least most of them
There are only two of the big boats I think in West Yell
I rather think he finds the boats his tenants are fishing with
Yes but there are not many of the old boats now
Not in the small boats
I think they pay hire for the boats and lines in that case and some of them own their own boats
They used to pay so much hire for the boat
I forget if it was  or s
No the lines were separate
Yes or a separate transaction or hire of them was made
Yes and supplies the material
Yes
Yes on the next point
No
After intimation was received that the Commissioners were to come here a meeting of the people was called and some nine or ten appeared  explained to them the object of the Commission and pressed them greatly to attend and give evidence but none of them would consent to come partly perhaps because they did not like and partly because they would have a feeling in speaking in regard to the proprietor before the Commission
On my suggestion another meeting was called shortly after that on a Saturday night when the fishermen were home from sea so that all who cared to be present might be there
I could not be present as I had to be at Lerwick but at that meeting no definite conclusion was come to
When I returned I pressed them individuallyprivately some of themto attend and state what were their grievances and what they thought would be for the benefit of the crofters and none of them would agree to come
Last night when I heard the meeting was to be today I tried three or four of them and two specially
One of the two agreed to come on condition that another would but the other would not come and I have come myself
I am sorry none of the islanders have come themselves
Seven miles by sea it is the island which was on your right when coming up the sound
Two years in September next
No
The Isle of Man but I only lived the first fourteen years of my life there
I had charge of a chapel of ease at Quarter near Hamilton in a mining district
Yes by parentage
I suppose so
I have a glebe and cultivate it myself
It is about ten or twelve rnerks and there is some scathold in connection with it
In regard to the agricultural pursuits they are really very limited the most of them just have what you could call small crofts which are worked in a primitive way
They dig their crofts with the spadethey have no horses capable of ploughing and the consequence is that there is a great deal of work entailed upon the women
In regard to the oats and potatoes which they sow a great many of them have been sowing the same seed which they were using twentyfive years ago in oats and potatoes
Yes I believe some of them plant turnips year after year on the same ground and have done so for upwards of nine or ten years together
As regards oats and potatoes the ground is varied but many keep a piece of ground for turnips and sow them there year after year
They leave it fallow but they do not put it on grass if they sowed grass they would not get the benefit of it
It is left to grow what will grow upon it but it is left fallow
Yes there is I suppose from a quarter to a third of the land left in that way
I have heard several say the potato crop is not only worse as regards disease but that the bulbs are smaller
I dont remember distinctly at this time of any person saying that but the Shetland oats as sown in Fetlar are an exceedingly poor crop exceedingly short
If they get a return of nine they would consider it good
Yes
Well they consider that extra good
I dont think they do
Sometimes they hardly know what they get it is so short and so poor I have heard people say that
Well last year was a very good year in Fetlar at least and I think they would set it down at six last year but it was a very good year
No not of late it has not been done of late
None whatever
There was one wire fence put up in the east part of the country lately but as a rule there has been no fencing since the late proprietorSir Arthur Nicolsondied
In the latter part of his life he did fence in scathold and make parks for private purposes in which people were not allowed to graze
There is no wire fencing there are what they call small turf dykes
There are
If an animal were so inclined they would not keep it in but I dont hear any complaint of the animals of one hamlet getting into another scathold
No none I think the largest is the farm of Salter
None
Personally I think it would but I cannot speak for the islanders many of them I believe are against it
It is very difficult to get a reason simply I suppose because they have been so long accustomed to being without fences
Well no person would sow grass unless they were sure they would get the benefit of it j if they sowed it in grass their neighbours would get as much benefit as themselves because after the crop is cut the animals are turned loose to winter over the crofts and scathold as they please
Really I could hardly say
My own opinion would be that a wire fence would be sufficient
A stone dyke would be more permanent and probably better but I think a wire fence would probably do
In regard to the scathold being taken under the late Sir Arthur Nicolson the present liferenterLady Nicolson has not in her day I believe curtailed the pasture at all
The complaint the people make now of having their pasture shortened is owing to what was done by the late Sir Arthur not by the present liferenter
Yes
Yes it was done by the late proprietor and not by the present liferenter
Yes and Lord Zetland and Lady Nicolson are the principal ones
I think not
It has been between the various proprietorsbetween Lord Zetland and Lady Nicolson and there was a subdivision there
None
No it has not
Some tenants would like a lease and others again would not
But again if you take my opinion I think a lease would be much more satisfactory because when a man came to find he had a hold on his property for a number of years he would be much more inclined to put his land in good order and keep his house tidy although at the same time there has not been in Lady Nicolsons time any removal of any tenant so far as I am aware
That is a question I can hardly answer
I should certainly be inclined to suggest that in the event of legislation leases should not be for less than a certain time
I would not be inclined to allow a lease to be given under nine years
That is a very difficult question to answer indeed
Well unless perhaps at the manse and on Lady Nicolsons own estate I do not think there has been and some of the cattle are of a very small kind
By the introduction of new blood
Crossing Shetland cattle with south country cattle
Shorthorns I think
And then the proprietor gets cattle brought into the island and they remain and those on the island cross with them and they are left very much to run themselves on the hill
Not so far as I know
I do not know any reason and I have advocated it with the islanders
I dont think the difference in food would be so much and even if they only kept one animal for three just now they would have a better chance of getting a good price than by keeping the small cattle
They are sold to buyers of cattle who come to Fetlar and purchase from the islanders
I suppose they do
No I think they are taken south
Generally three years old
From  to  for threeyear olds
I think so for Fetlar is a fertile island and there is a good pasture over it
By having larger crofts
There are no large farms but there is plenty unused ground which is quite arable I believe and a great deal without very much drainage would grow excellent oats and potatoes
Fetlar is a very fertile island
A few go to the fishing but at the present time I think there are only five boats in the island engaged in fishing
The fishing station is on the most exposed part of the island facing the southeast
There is no accommodation at all in the way of a pier
Unless Uyea or Rostar there is no other place where a pier could be placed except at very great expense
But I believe at this place a pier could be built without very great cost
At one of these places there are remains of an old pier which would not take very much to be put right for a fishing station
Frequently
Five at present
I think there might if they had only money to get them
I could not tell you the population I think is
Between seventy and eighty families I think
Yes but there are a few men fishing in other places at Unst and Mid Yell
They hold six because there is no accommodation in the meantime for large boats at the island
About fifteen and upwards
No whether they go to sea or not they generally leave school about the age when they need not go after thirteen
Yes it is
The teacher just now is leaving his house and although he has not presented many pupils he has passed I think for the last three years  per cent
Very
There are three members in Fetlar and four in North Yellseven altogether
With the exception of the one which I said was ten acres most of them will run from three to five merks or acres a merk is generally about an acre
Yes
Principally two milk cows and two or three growing up to sell those of them who are fairly prosperous have been doing that
They have all some ponies and need them for bringing home their fuel
Yes from time to time
They sell ponies and that is about the chief means they have of making their rent
Fetlar I believe has a good name for ponies and people I believe come into the island from other places and purchase them
Well you might call them dealers
There are people who come and traffic a good deal with the farmers
Yes they have done that since I came to Fetlar
I could not say as to that
I have only been two years in the island and there have been several different people coming in that time
Yes there is no difficultyin disposing of the ponies
A very few of them may have a few sheep but I dont think many of them keep many
I  dont think there is one in Fetlar now they are all cheviots and cross breeds
There was and there are some that come pretty near the breed yet
They are small and fine but as a rule the sheep kept have at least a good deal of Cheviot blood in them
Oh yes the young women knit they have a good deal of difficulty in finding a market
They buy it from their neighbours in the other islands
I think there is no doubt of it
I cannot say that the knitting industry is flourishing
The girls have a great deal of digging in the seed time and a great deal of harrowing and mainly attend to the bringing home of the potatoes and they work a great deal in the harvest so that their time is greatly taken up
If they had nothing to do but knit they would make a good thing of it but they have not time
I question if they had that aim when the other sheep were brought in
The other sheep were brought in by accident and were crossed by accident
Of that I cannot speak but I think the land so far as I have heard the tenants say is fairly and reasonably rented
One Thomas Jamieson
Between Lord Zetland and Lady Nicolson only lately
Not so far as I know
Sheep and cattle and ponies
I can hardly tell you
Much more than that they are grazing on different parts of his property
Well if you speak of the home farm that is so but when I said there was no large farm I spoke of the tenantry
It is not a farm at all it is unenclosed
A very great deal of italmost the whole island is capable of cultivation
The present proprietor is only liferenter I suppose but the land belonged to Sir Arthur Nicolson
I rather think there is more of the land under her own control than there is occupied by the tenantry
I know that for nine or ten years that has been so
No
I dont know I suppose because their fathers did it before them
No I think they manure their land fairly well with the limited amount of stock they have to feed
Last year in many places there was a good deal of fingerandtoe
I dont know
No I never heard that objection taken to them
I believe if you were calling twenty of the islanders who did object to it they could not give a definite reason why they objected
As a rule a merk is about an acre
Throughout Shetland I think a merk is near an acre
Well it will do no more do you mean between giving a little grass and oats
You mean a merk of land along with scathold
Yes
Yes at least with a good deal of scatholda fair amount of scathold
They must keep fewer cattle they cannot graze on the croft because there is no grass
Unless they have grass on the scathold they cannot graze on the croft unless they let them graze on the grain itself
No I think they are free to sell to whom they please
No
There are three merchants and any one in the island is free to go to either of these and out of the island if he pleases
I think it is about that
Decreasing
I could hardly say rapidly but it certainly is decreasing
I think it is
Well a good many of the younger men now find they can do better away from Fetlar than they can in it there is nothing for them to do in it unless they go to the fishing and the fishing is not very much in the meantime
No I have not
I think the island is about  miles long by  miles wide but it is greatly eaten in with bights
I believe it could be quadrupled at least
You seldom come except upon hilly ground on land which is not arable or which could not easily be made arable and then from the formation of the surface it is quite evident that in former years a great deal of ground had been cultivated which is now in grass
No hot more so than in the hands of the tenants as scathold for meadow ground
I can only speak from hearsay
His opinion was that this land would pay him better if he converted it into sheep farms
Of course that was long before my day and I can hardly say but as I have heard old islanders state that thirty years ago there were nearly  people in the island and they did not require to import corn but could export it
I dont know
No I am not aware of that
Some of them would be and others I dont think could do so unless they were aided some of them are what you would say very poor
There are a few who are in fairly easy circumstances as crofters
The people seem to have a feeling in case they might be called upon to state anything which might injure them with the proprietor that is my own idea and some of them might not come owing to backwardness
I dont think so
There are different meanings to the word timid
As regards going to sea they have no fear but they might have a feeling if they were holding a small croft and coming forward to give evidence
Well as regards that being so I dont know but I believe some of them might not care to come forward in case they might be called upon to make a statement which would reflect upon the proprietor
I said I thought they would not be pressed to make any statement of that kind
Mr Colin Arthurson
At Still in Fetlar
I believe she has property near Lerwick
There is not a lease on the island
No
No I cannot say I have
I can only speak for myself
If I had not a hold I would not have done so much as I have done
Every fortnight
No meal was imported and they exported to neighbouring islands I have been told that by several old inhabitants
Not so far as I have heard
I have heard them say that last summer was as fine as any that the oldest inhabitant remembered
No it was my own experience of what I had myself
I had seed from the south and that was counted an exceedingly good return
It is good soil but not very much better than the soil round about it
The old minister used the plough and it is possible the ground may be better wrought
As I said before I think the acreage under cultivation might be quadrupled
I should think from what I see myself she has more than half but still it would require an old islander who knew the island better than I do to say
I should say twothirds
I would just say that as far as I know the great desire of the islanders is more scathold many of them desire a lease and many of them would certainly take a larger holding than they have got and for a term of years
A few might and others would do it if they got a little assistance
I dont think there is any general complaint of the rents want of scathold is the great thing
I may state that many people complain of the addition made to their rents when repairs were executed upon the church or manse at the present time
That was called church rate and amounts to s
The crofters and heritors are bound to keep up both church and manse but in point of fact the above system makes the crofter do it
The people thought the rate might at least be removed in a few years but it has become permanent
Yes
General merchant and fish curer
Almost continually
Both but quite voluntarily on the part of those connected with me
I think the money system is now predominating very much except where fishermen require advances to enable them to carry on their pursuits
Twentyfive years or more
I do not recognise it as the truck system as it is understood in England it is a necessity of the situation which the poor fishermen are placed in that they must have the assistance of those who employ them to carry on their occupations
I think it was
I think so in a great measure
I think not
There were some abuses probably shown about the time of the Truck Commission but as a general rule I do not think there was anything to object to in it
None whatever
Yes
To a large extent
Yes they are of a larger description and adapted to the herring fishery which has now developed to a larger extent
Large boats of from  feet to  feet of keel
Wholly decked now
About  feet I think
Twenty to twentyfive tons
Yes
In the fishery they were halfdecked boats and a great many of the native boats of the country some of which are still in existence
I think in a great measure it gives them an opportunity of making larger earnings but at a greater risk and outlay
Were it coming an unsuccessful season the effect and consequence to the people as well as those engaged in the business would be very serious much more so than under the older system
Well they have not required to do so
No it is has been remarkable during the past few years that herring fishery has been pursued close to the islands
Yes the early herring fishery was carried on the west coast very many years ago long before the present time
No they are usually provided to the men and they endeavour to pay them off as they can out of their earnings
No they purchase them but they have to get credit upon them for an indefinite period
There are generally six men in a boat and sometimes four of them are considered shareholderssometimes all of them
Yes it is understood the half of the earnings are to go in towards the price of the boat
I am not aware of any departure from that in the habit
Yes
I have known it almost paid off in one or two years but that was an extraordinarily successful fishing
Yes when they are paid for
A great many of them are
The half of them usually goes in upon the boat
They fish for whom they like unless they have made a special bargain with the outfitter who equips them
Sometimes it is made a condition that he shall have the preference at general prices of the country
Yes
It is generally discussed amongst the curers and the fishermen before anything is decided upon
It is a pretty uniform price which exists at present
There are many cases in which I refuse to take them I could not take them all
Partly in both we are in the position of having advanced for provisions what they required either in money or goods
No certainly not
I think it is less the custom than formerly
It depends entirely on the success of the fishing
Many of them
I think they are all in very fair circumstances at present and do not require them
While the fishing continues successful it will be so but if a reaction takes place I expect considerable evil and misery from the increased earnings of the last few years inducing more expensive habits amongst them
A very great amount I believe
Yes
No not at all his property in Shetland is not of any great extent
His property is more in Orkney
About  I think
I cannot say off hand
Yes they are almost all crofters
Most of them I should think are fishermen and sailorsa great many of them
There are not many holdings which enable them to maintain themselves wholly by farming
Fishing combined with the croft
None upon Lord Zetlands property
They vary very much
As a general rule they vary from  to 
Well in exceptional cases there are
It used to be the system to have one animal for each  of rent but they exceed very much sometimes
When they have unlimited pasture they keep more stock than they are able to provide for during the winter time
I said about one for every  of rent with the addition of a few sheep
There is no limit
They all have a few but their numbers are small comparatively to what they were in former days
That is one of the means by which they pay their rent
The rearing and disposal of one pony would often pay their rent entirely
No it has advanced very much
They will get as much for a oneyearold pony almost as will pay the rent
A oneyearold pony will bring from  to  twoyearold about  and threeyearold about 
Not all a great many of them are sailors
There are a few isolated cases where they do so
Some of them stay at home to look after the sheep and make a living in that way tradesmen and others
Almost entirely oats and bere and potatoes
Very little
They are beginning to do so more generally now but to a very small extent
No it is almost entirely spade culture
They have that impression
Their crofts are too small to maintain ploughing
In some districts there are fewer native ploughs than there were sixty years ago
Not in these crofts
The system has been a very pernicious one with the scalping of the hills and the bringing in virgin earth to use as manure that is one reason why the communities have been put under better regulations of late years
They have but not to the unlimited extent that obtained in former years
None
There are no tacksmen in that sense of the word I think about  is the highest rent
None whatever
It has required a good deal of care to prevent subdivision of farms but that has been avoided so far as possible
It is understood there is no subdivision on Lord Zetlands property We would rather enlarge them if it were possible
Well when a farm comes below  or  it is not sufficient to maintain a family upon it and those who hold crofts are usually in much poorer circumstances than those who have
On some properties I believe that does exist to some little extent
No there are usually special arrangements in every case according to the circumstances
They are supposed to maintain their houses once they are furnished with them but they do not always do so
I say it is done by arrangement according to the circumstances of the case
There never has been a case in my experience on Lord Zetlands estate of men leaving the property
Very regularly indeed but I should explain that Lord Zetlands lands are very moderately rented probably in comparison with others in the country
Very little indeed almost none
I think not
We do not approve of squatters
I suppose they naturally emigrate to places where they can make a better living than in this country
The most of our people are seafaring men who go to the colonies in the course of their profession and often settle there and there has been a great deal of voluntary emigration from Shetland of late years
No from Shetland generally
Yes many young men go abroad
Yes the natural increase
None at all
No nothing more than usual
I am not aware of any of Lord Zetlands tenants being in debt
They are not all in the category you were asking me the previous questions about I was speaking of the people all over
Probably they will be
Either off their crofts or their earnings at sea
No no pledge it is a matter of arrangement that a portion of the earnings go to clear the price of the boat and goods
Not necessarily I am not aware of any cases of that that have come under my notice
It usually commences in March and lasts till September
No but the combined fishings
Usually before they commence in the winter season
The system has become very much assimilated to that which obtains on the Scotch coast
Yes
In October or November
Not necessarily
If they require it in special cases there is no system of forced advance
I think so they accommodate him in that way very frequently
I think not
I never heard of two prices any one making a purchase might get discount for ready money but the prices are the same
If you go to take credit from any tailor in London I suppose you have that system
It is the staple food
I cannot say
It is regulated by the price in Aberdeen or wherever it is imported from
It fluctuates with the market rate
All the stores keep these goods
I cannot say at this moment
It varies
No I am sorry to say I have not paid that attention to it
Not at all
I do not look at it in that light I think it was a necessity of the situation
The country is wide and the population sparse and there are few places where people can get the necessities of life and they must go where they can set them
I do not know that it was compulsory it was a result of the situation
In former days the proprietor had in a great measure to support his tenantry when they were in very poor circumstances
I think at present they are in fair circumstances all over the country
Not one in Shetland
I do not believe there is a case of compulsion in Shetland
Yes I commenced business early
My father had been largely engaged in business
Probably about the commencement of the century
Yes
Yes I think I am pretty familiar with all the circumstances of the place
Very slight in the case of a few widows perhaps
Almost every different farm varies because there is so much grass and so much arable I cannot answer that question
No
No I do not think he would have five acres
He would have five acres including grass land
The pasture is different
He would
No I could not say I did not come prepared to do so
I have never heard any complaint of such a thing
I do not think there are any cases of rack renting in Shetland that is a matter which cures itself very quickly if the rents were too high people cannot pay them and leave
They are bad payers if the rents are too high
It is one of the mistakes made for in putting too high rents on the crofts the landlord suffers
No not very great there is no great demand at this moment by crofters for more farms
The native spade is used
It is not a heavy spade it is one of very old date one used with the foot
No I have heard nothing of the kind for many years there has been no dissatisfaction expressed
There may be dissatisfied individuals but there is no dissatisfaction whatever in the country
It is about stationary I think in consequence of the emigration and the ordinary outlets
Yes
I am not sure of the largest but there are a few in this neighbourhood
The largest here is Binnsgarth which belongs to my brother
Sir George Hays
I think about 
Combined agricultural and sheep farm
Yes
It is chiefly a sheep farm combined with agricultural
I think a great many of them find their way elsewhere
If they are sailors they go out into the world and probably settle elsewhere
In the case of daughters they become servant girls and go elsewhere and sometimes do not return
I think not
I think they rather like to go elsewhere
Yes I do uot think they have that earth hunger we heard talk of in the Western Islands
The poor rate and school rate are those principally complained of
In large districts with a small rental the school rate particularly presses heavily upon the people
Between s and s in the pound onehalf of which is paid by the tenant that is for school rate alone
It is also very heavy in some districts
No I think it is very much in consequence of mismanagement and the want of a poorhouse
No
Yes
One fertile cause of the high rate is when people leave this country and get into bad health and poor circumstances and we have no place to bring them back to and we must submit to pay the same allowance as is given in larger places
The number of lunatics in some of the poorer districts also causes very heavy burdens
Most frequently to Montrose or Morningside
There are several large proprietors
In the neighbourhood of Lerwick there is no large proprietor
The island of Bressay is the property of Miss Cameron Mowat
Three miles by two
She is not a very large proprietrix in this neighbourhood but she is in different parishes
I think the chief property she has is in the island of Fetlar
She has twothirds of the island of Fetlar
Yes a great many
There are a great many of them
Yes they cultivate their own land
There are few proprietors having property worth  or  who farm their own land
There are not many of that class
A man as a little investment may have that amount of land and may let it to some one else
When it comes into the market there is sometimes considerable competition for it
It would depend very much if there was any one wanting to sell
There is very little at present
Sometimes you see occasional advertisements of land for sale but I am not aware of any just now
No
It is pretty stationary
There was some increase a few years ago but it has been in about a normal state for a long time
Each year there is always an increase in the extent of the roads but it is done under the Road Act
No very light indeed
It has increased to some extent of late years
There is a great deal more building going on in consequence principally of the fisheries
There is no difficulty hers
There is what is called the town property and it can be feued by any one wanting it
Within the burgh boundaries
Feuing
It is given off by the foot
I think it is limited to d a foot in one line of street and d in another with a bonus of  
No it has been erected by a Limited Liability Company
To the diminished numbers I think as well as the demand for them for coal mines
It has been attempted but it lessens the value
Their value consists in their small size
If they exceed a certain size they are not suitable for coalmines and the cause of the increase in price is owing to the demand for the coal mines
The Marquis of Londonderry is the only large breeder
He has a farm for raising ponies for the purposes of his own coal mines
The farm is on the island of Noss and partly on the island of Bressay
Beyond Bressay
It is the chief occupation of the female population
Oh yes
I believe Shetland hosiery has always stood very well in the market
I think so
The larger farmers have introduced crossbreds and Cheviots and Leicesters but the crofters can only have the native breed
So far as it can be got but there is a good deal of imported wool used
I think it is I do not think there are so many as there used to be the people pay no attention to the breeding of them
I do not think you would get the same quality of real pure Shetland wool now that you could have got many years ago
It is often bought up and taken away from the country
Yes
Yes I think there is not the same attention paid to keep up the breed
No except in very few instances
If they did not provide winter food they could not keep them
No I merely came forward in deference to the request of the Commission
Yes
I should say that our desire has been always on Lord Zetlands property not to press upon people but to keep the rents moderate and have them well paid
There has not been the striving to raise the rent which an individual might have done on his own property
No I think not not considerably in comparison or in proportion with the advance in the price of goods
No it has not been commensurate even with advance
A few labourers perhaps for the purposes of the farm
There will be in some cases
No they perhaps pay nothing
They get a house and may give their labour
In money always
None whatever
There is no complaint but there is no doubt the soil does not produce as it ought to do if it were cultivated properly
In cases where they are prohibited from taking the native soil off the hills and they are not able to give it manure it cannot produce the crops it did
The pastures are almost all now subdivided and each proprietor knows his own
They are not quite common the scatholds of the whole district are subdivided
Yes
Anywhere
With a few exceptions
There are a few districts where it is rather difficult to get fuel but almost every farm has abundance
No
There is no payment for fuel
Where it is convenient
None at all
Oatmeal chiefly but there is a great deal of wheaten flour used
It is not to the advantage of the people I think
Very greatly I think
There is a great deal sent from the town but in two or three districts there have been bakeries opened of late years
I think so
Yes I think so
Scones
No I think not
In the town possibly in a crowded season there may be but never in the country
I think so
In two or three districts they still make a good deal of the native cloth but it is not general now
Native wool
In two or three districts
I think so more durable
The parishes of North Mavine Delting and Aithsting and there may be more
Wherever there is any number of sheep the crofter will make use of the wool in making it into cloth
I am sorry I cannot tell you
No when you get the pure Shetland wool
No
Yes there is a great sale for them here in town
They are brought here and offered in the James Arthur market and bring high prices taking into ace unit the size and weight
Yes
No not of sheep
I think so in the winter season
Where they can afford it they often join together and purchase or kill a cow at November time
Well that is a common custom
Very often the landlord has to furnish the house entirely at considerable cost and when he does so it often brings the rental of the place beyond what the tenant can take out of the soil
A stone and lime house
Two rooms with two large closets perhaps
Some of them put in a slight attic
A great many of them are wishing to have the felt roofs but we dont approve of them
The turf roof is considered preferablea thatch roof
Yes
Straw
Yes
Very rarely
They come to be rather too expensive for the holdings
Wood in one end and earth in the other
Generally there are chimneys now in both ends
Very often attached
Yes
Not less than from  to 
Yes by arrangement it might be so
He in very often asked to pay  per cent but that sometimes comes to more than he can pay in addition to the previous rent
The landlord has often to furnish such houses and get no return
Yes a great many of them and just from that cause that the holding cannot bear the outlay necessary to put up an improved house
I think so the people are improving very much themselves
The old system was I believe that the landlord contributed a certain partthe roof or portions of the building
No better than the crofters
I am not aware of any
I have heard of no case of that
No unless they have had a little bit of property of their own
No
I havs not heard of anything of that kind obtaining here
By agitation it may be created but there is nothing of that sort just now
No I have never heard of it
People in Lerwick
The population of the town is increasing so much it is necessary for them to build houses
A good many of the people fishermen and othersfind they cannot combine fishing and the crofting system together and come into town and require accommodation
When their means afford it
There is a difficulty in getting rooms to rent in the town
None
No
No
Eighteen
Six are in the rentroll
Yes
The same story which they all have and the same complaint
My father came to Scadabay forty years ago and then there were six in the place
They were quite well off and quite independent when these six had the place
Then the families increased and they must needs marry and they married  and when a man married he required to get a house and there was no place for him to build it except upon his fathers lot
And so the town is now swelled up to eighteen families
The eighteen are making their living on the place that is to say each of them has a bit of the land that there is
They are each taking a share in the cultivation of the place and so far taking a living out of it
Now this has reduced the whole of them to the same impoverished condition and if they fall back during the next fifteen years to the same extent that they have done during the last forty they will all be on the poor roll
Some whose names are upon the rent roll have only two sheep and two cows
I am not aware that it has
No
No
Yes
 s without taxes
Three milk cows three young ones and twentyfive head of sheep excluding lambs
Lord Dunmores
No we are tacked on togethera crofter population
It is crofters that adjoin us
Cuidinish Deirecleit and Ceandevig
No other reason  but what else could they do if they could get no additional place to occupy
Yes they need that but cannot take much out of it
Every person cannot bring home money from the south by his earnings
It would be better to have a good comfortable living at home than to risk the chance of straying abroad
It is not every man who could make a comfortable living by shifting about in that way
Not of their own will if they have a place to which to return
Yes but they send them away with plenty of money to get homes and lands for them elsewhere and sometimes lucrative appointments when they become gentlemen
If such a case occurred money would be sent after him
Well we poor people sending our family away without perhaps as much money as will pay their passage with insufficient clothing and no education often fear they may fare badly and that worse may befall them
They must buy clothes with the first wages they earn and the first  they can spare must be sent home to keep their father and mother alive
It is only those that try it that feel the hardship of it
They will not have to support their fathers and mothers though and they will not have to pay the rent of the small patch of land their father possesses
Where there is only one son he must needs remain at home to till the ground
No a bachelor is an object of charity all the world over and such a condition was not appointed to the children of men
Yes that is his first duty and to get land to occupy it
These were the first commands he received
I do not know  what is written is that  He gave the land to the children of men
That was quite the case but it was added  replenish the earth
Yes
I do not know that it is
Nineteen
Yes
Yes
The place was occupied by two men formerly
The rent was  Now there are eight crofters and there is not one of them without cattle and sheep except one
About  s
Yes there are eleven families without land and these are a great burden upon us for we cannot see them allowed to go without any land at all
There are three without any children of school age and these have to pay school rates when it is those with plenty of childrenthe cottarswho reap the advantage of it
Now this is a great source and injury
Then there are others who would be very glad to get land if they only got it and who would be more able to take it than many who have it and who sorely need it
That is what left our place so poor
I myself was born in Rodel
I saw my mother with her youngest child taken out of the house in a blanket and laid down by the side of a dyke and the place pulled down
My mother was in childbed at the time
The child was only born the previous night and my father asked MLeod who was proprietor at the time whether he would not allow them to remain in the house for a few days but permission was not given only he came to the dykeside where she lay and asked what this was and when he was told he asked him to lift her up and remove her to an empty barn and it was there she was put
If these cottars were to get land the crofters who are on the rent roll would be very much better off for these cottars without land are of no benefit to the proprietor or crofter or anybody elserather the reverse
Nearly forty families
The half of it was under gentlemen tacksmen
It was the clearing of that place that destroyed the country when they were sent up to the east side
It was MLeod himself that took the place and kept it for two years and afterwards he gave it to Stewart
I cannot tell
It is about sixtysix or sixtyseven years since it was cleared
The proprietor has it now
An uncle of mine came there first
These two men had it and there were three or four subdivisions of their own
Then when the place was cleared that I spoke of other two were brought in
They belonged to the place
Some of them lost the land that they hadothers sprang up there
These are able to take land now if they got itsome of them more able than those who have land
Ten families
Yes
I wish to speak of the poor condition of the people ever since I first remember them
When I first remember the place my father had a holding there
The third part of the island was under crofts
There were fourteen families upon that portion
These crofts were removed when I was nine years of age and the island was cleared for John MDonald
The whole fourteen families were removed from the island in all directions
Some went to the southwest of Harris some to Lewis and others elsewhere
My father was allowed to remain by the tacksman in the place where we were when we had a croft and that accounts for our being in the island
Ever since we lost that land we have not been able to get a holding of land since
We had nothing but to be cottars under the tacksman and to be dealt with just as he pleased and the arrangement between him and us which subsisted while he was in life was thiswe worked the land for him and we gave him half the produce
He allowed us to keep a cow and eight sheep
His son succeeded him and he made a different arrangement with us
We had net cow or sheep since that time
At that time we had to take to the lobster fishing and such work as goes on in the place
This tacksman gave us potato ground to the extent of four or five barrels upon condition that we would give him in return farm service any day of the year he wished us
And now because we were in a very remote corner of the world where few advantages could be got we were obliged to accept these conditions although we felt them hard
We are not allowed to sow either oats or barley but only potatoes and we are obliged to fish the whole year summer and winter autumn and spring in order to enable us to obtain a livelihood for this amount of potatoes does little to support us
I have been head of a family for the last twentysix years and during that time I have neither had cow nor sheep and I did not earn sixpence on Taransay ever since
I have obtained my livelihood by braving many a danger upon the wild shore through the spring and winter months where a stranger could scarcely expect that a boat would live
It is a suitable fishing station but the coast is wild and exposed and during the winter months it may be two months and it may be five or six weeks before a boat could leave the shore
It is only small boats that we have and the fishing we prosecute does not require heavy boats neither does the shore upon which we land them
They must be boats of such weight as we can haul ashore
Nothing
Well upon certain days we must remain at home from our own fishingsuch days as when we have to ferry heavy cattle between the shore and the island and such work as that that requires people in order to carry it out
We work very irregularlya bit of a day now and a bit of a day againbut I believe if they were all strung together they would make about sixty full days in the year
Perhaps some weeks we might be called twice and others not
We had suggested information to that effect to Mr Mackenzie ourselves
I would think they might be inclined to pay  each for it
It would certainly support forty families
I could give no information upon that matter
A fortieth of it would be worth  or   at least
Yes sometimes
His principal dwelling is at Scaristaveg
Two
The shepherd can tell I do not know
Yes there are a lot of cattle
No
The will of the tacksman
We get no milk at all unless from some of the neighbours when they come ashore from the mainland
They are
There are seventysix inhabitants on the island
I do not know the number of children
It is only one of these that has milk a servant of Taransay
That is the case considering the calculation I have made of the days of the week
The head of the family does it the women do it and the children do it accordingly as one is more handy when the work is needed
Only one
Yes
In Pabbay
Yes
They were able to support themselves and to sell some when they were there
I cannot tell
We had not much when we went there but our stock was increasing
We had a great deal of stock when we left it
 s or  s
In the first place we went to we were allowed to remain three years
Big Borv
Yes
Little Borv
Two years
We were put out of it
Well they did not wish us to remain there
Not the whole of it
Some of the rent was unpaid
When the people were summoned out of this Little Borv the factor told them that if they got security they would pay  at the next market they would not be disturbed that year
The minister that was at Scarista at the timethe present minister of South Uistoffered to become security for the required amount but they would not accept the security
They wanted to add Big Borv to the tack of Scaristavore
I believe they were behind with their rent
The years were very bad and there was no price for cattle
The prices rose the very year they left and never fell to the same point since
I do not think they were in debt for which the stock could be called upon to pay
The minister said at the time they were sent away that the poorest man in the country might become security for them because they had sufficient stock to meet the demands upon them
Yes
Well he said himself that it was through the factor that he received his stipend and that his stipend might be good for the sum
MDonald of Rodel
Yes it was the same factor
I cannot tell
It was Captain Sitwell who arranged they should be sent there
I believe not
Ardhassaig West Loch Tarbert
Yes where there was not a stone upon the groundboth house and barn
There was not much in the outlay
The family assisted to build it
Not a shilling
There were the walls of the house
Yes
No but we removed the roof of it when we went away
No it was against their will
The very opposite
At Ardhassaig again after we were shifted we were there a year without land at all
The man into whose land we came had himself cropped it that year and so we had no crop and that threw the family back very much
In the beginning of summer
Nothing we dwelt in a bothy till we were able to build a house
I cannot tell
We were paying certainly
I know the first settlement we went to we were paying   but I cannot tell what was paid after that
Twice a year
It was taken from them at any time
I do not remember that he did
I am here to represent seven townships
There are sixtyseven families in the whole of these places
When I took land there thirtytwo years ago there were only twentytwo
Yes
I have to say that they are very poor and that the one half of them injure the other half
Also that of the twentytwo croftsthere are only three which are not subdivided
The people who occupy these three are certainly better off than the rest of the people the inference from which is that it is want of land that is impoverishing them all
I have to say that some of the crofts upon which there was only one family when I came there have now five families upon them
I have nine of a family myself of whom four are sons ranging from twentynine to twenty years of age and in a very short time through the operation of the same cause that impoverished my neighbours I expect to be worse off than any of them
It was mentioned here today that some people were taking their seaware from Skye and Uist and other places far away
I have a boat of seven tons weight and with my four sons I take the seaware from these places and further off
When I am able to bring this manure home early in the season I can sow my crops in better time than my neighbours who have not the same advantages in this respect that I have are able to do
If it were not for the kindness of the people towards one another both in allowing those who are not able to take seaware from a distance to gather what comes upon the shore at home and also in giving them patches of ground to cover up with seaware so as to make use of it I dont know what might become of them at all
I tried various pursuits in order to make a livelihood within the last thirtytwo years but among them all I have not been able to find one equal to cultivatingthat is to taking my livelihood out of the land
I have of such land as is going a sufficient amount to maintain myself and my family are springing up and there is nothing left to distribute among them
A month ago my fourth son left the island without being too communicative with me about the matter but he took some of the neighbours into his confidence and I got a letter from Glasgow and he is now upon his way to Queensland
His letter was that when the oldestAlexanderwas to settle down he could get a portion of the croft and when the second was to settle downMurdochhe was to get a share but what was to remain to him in the land of his birth and therefore he would require to go away
Where we live mans physical strength holds not forth long
When we make our creels for carrying up this seaware from the boats to the crofts we must make them of different sizes according to the strength of the person who has to carry them for they all must take a share in it
I once cut peats where I now grow crops and by continual working at it during the winterdraining itI have been able to take some reasonable crop out of it but my bodily strength cannot improve it more
When I came to the place first if I had a barrel of potatoes to sell I could sell it for s but now if it could be sold at all such is the overcrowding and scarcity of potatoes that it costs s
There is no need to talk much longer of the matter
I dont wish to blame either factor or proprietor in the least for bringing about the state of matters that exist
The main cause has been the squatting of the people of the place and not one of them getting an opportunity of removing elsewhere
The people of the Bays in Harris have no wool of their own but they purchase wool elsewhere and their wives through the night manufacture it into cloth
I myself get it for themas much as  stones in one year from tacksmen through Uist and elsewhere at prices ranging from s to s per stone
This enterprise was carried on through the kindness of the Dowager Countess and Mrs Thomas and except for the proceeds of this manufacture I do not know how these people could live at all
The people are quite accustomed to work bad land
There is no good land for them
The little good there is they were driven out of it
So much am I accustomed to this that I could not work good land if I had it now
It is needless to expatiate upon it
Suppose I should go on till tomorrow morning the burden of it would be that the only remedy is additional land for the people
I along with my family am able to keep a fishing boat agoingLuskin upon the road leading to the churchyard for I have seen the coffins carried upon our shoulders dragged through the floodsix men strung together and following the course of the stream in order to keep themselves from being swept away with the bier upon their shoulders
I was a young man in South Harris at Obbe and there was a miller there and I remember two boats laden with grain going to Stornoway distillery and sold at Is a peck as the export of the district beyond what was necessary for the support of the inhabitants
I also know that when my father had plenty of land such was the comfortable mode in which we lived that I myself as a young lad was throwing the old potatoes out into the sea in order to find a place in which to store up the new potatoes in the beginning of autumn
I believe that if the township on which I live was occupied by one man instead of six as it is the same thing might occur again
They cannot grow so well as to supply potatoes to all the people of the place
I do not want a single rig of land for myself
I have quite sufficient for my own personal purposes
But if my family would wish to follow the same pursuit there is no land for them and if I were to share with them the small portion I have myself I would be worse off than ever I was before
It is the want of land that ruins them
I have paid rent to five factors and I never owed a shilling upon rent collection day but instead of having a whole lot if I had only half a lot I might now have been probably   behind
Well I had no experience of destitution on the west coast till now and so I cannot speak of it comparatively and all I can say is that it was very harassing indeed
Yes and to the failure of the early fishing last year
The herring fishing
It has in Harris
Very much so
Yes in consequence of the inability of the dealers to meet their own payments and their inability to relieve the people as they were in the habit of doing
A great deal
First of all Sir Edward Scotts good deeds this year can hardly be set forth
He spent I may safely say over  in relieving the distress this year and that for about onethird of the population of Harris
From Edinburgh Glasgow and London we have had a great deal of money
From Glasgow Relief Committee we had  and from the Lord Mayors fund  In all the money for relief this year to Harris has been considerably over about 
Not all quite spent We are keeping a little in handknowing that our distress is not by any means at an end and fearing that until the th of August when we expect some new potatoes there may not be an end of it
At present we have good reason to fear that the worst is before us
Well the usual difficultiesa good deal of complaint on the part of those who did not get as much as they thought they should have
We cannot avoid those difficulties
We have had to be
With regard to seed there was scarcely any discrimination required for the simple reason that they all needed it and if the money spent in providing seed were taken from their stock it would leave very little for paying the proprietor or the merchants or dealers accounts
Well the almost universal cry is for more landthat if the people had more land they would not be subject to such destitution it future and I believe that cry is well founded Overcrowding is the chief indeed the only cause of complaint
In Harris we have no quarrel whatever no grievance whatever to be traced to the conduct of the present proprietors or their agents with one exception however and as I am here to represent Tarbert perhaps you will let me read a paper which one of them prepared setting forth the grievances of the people of the village
With that single exception we have no grievance whatever to be traced to the conduct of proprietor or agent That grievance refers to the question of feucharters or feuduty
People have built and after building they regret having done so
They have built on what they see to be foolishly short leases for thirtyeight years and after thirtyeight years the building is to revert to the proprietor without any compensation
It must affect the trade for it discourages all building of houses and affects the comfort of the people for there is many a one who would build a nice little house for himself if he were not so heavily taxed for it
The price paid for the site is higher than anything I ever heard of in Scotland
Our grievances are  short period of lease   No compensation on expiry of lease   The high rate of feuduty
In  the rate of feuduty was s and fiftyseven years lease now we are charged  feuduty and only thirtyeight years lease
Now we consider that   is full value for the site of our houses which only measures  by  feet Should we get compensation for our labour and expense on expiry of our leases we are quite willing to pay  feuduty provided we be allowed compensation for our labour and expense when our leases expire or get perpetual leases and respectable gardens attached to our houses
The land on which our houses are built was only  rent in  and on that land we are now paying s feufeuduty complained of
The chief cause of the houses of this country being such miserable huts is that should the people make better ones they will be so much burdened with taxes that they prefer not making any improvements at all
Those who have no land and consequently no straw if they happen to put wooden roofs on their houses they are immediately heavily taxed on that account
I would consider it very fair profit for a merchant in the course of thirtyeight years besides supporting himself and family to save  or  This our proprietor saves without any trouble whatever to himself
Owing to the poverty of the country we are almost ruined with school and poor rates
In  we paid s d per pound for poor rates and s per pound for school rates
This year we pay s d per pound for poor rates and s d per pound for school rates
The chief cause of these taxes being so heavy is the poverty of the country
The people are so crammed together on the top of rocks and bogs and consequently so extremely poor that they are not able to provide clothing for their children to send them to school and when the School Board compels the parents to send their children to school they can do nothing else in the circumstances they are placed in than apply to the Parochial Board to provide their children with what they are quite unable themselves to supply
If the people get no land we shall be getting worse from year to year because the people are getting so well versed in law that they being poor know right well if we want to send their children to school we must see them clothed in the event of them not being able to do it themselves
If school and poor rates continue to increase in this way both tacksmen and crofters will be forced to throw up their lands
The herring fishing which proved very remunerative here in former years has been a complete failure for the past three years and if fish is to be got it is not on the side of the island the people inhabit
If the people however got a sufficient portion of their native land to work they would  not need to apply to any Parochial Board for getting their children clothed because they could do it themselves and others besides
Let the people possess the land their ancestors possessed and that at reasonable rents compensation for improvements and twenty or thirty years lease and I am sure there will be very little heard about destitution
The two meal mills in the island are sunk in debt to the amount of  notwithstanding the fact that they were getting onesixteenth part of the grain of Harris
Six years ago the mills required some repairs in slating but the proprietor refused to expend any money on them as the onesixteenth part of the grain of Harris would not evidently pay the aforesaid repairs
In my opinion land is the only remedy for the poverty of the people
Government may exhaust all their resources in relieving the poverty of the Highlands but their efforts will be all in vain until they give the land of the people to the people and not to sheep and deer as is now the case
I do
I do not know if that would of course increase it but it might be the means of encouraging some who may be disposed to come and build here
I do not think that is the case
The writer of the paper seems to me to mean that if the cottars about here who now live in huts should think of improving their houses or building them in better style they are at once taxed
Even without leases I think they have been taxed though they merely built them and are tenants at will
They do not in the village
They have free houses
The proprietor allows them to build and does not charge them feuduty
They have no lease whatever and they are taxed meanwhile
That is the problem the Commissioners or the Government have to solve
I suspect I can give them very little light upon it only there are some corners here and there
The other day I was in the island of Taransay a pretty large islandand the rental I take to be about  Now I saw the arable land there in the island and I should say it could easily accommodate forty comfortable tenants at the very reasonable rent of  which would make  The present tacksmen does not pay  Now it may be said Why these crofters would not paythey get into arrears
I believe the Harris arrears are very high indeed but I suppose that would hardly be called a grievance anywhere
I am disposed to lay it down as one of the grievances the people are subjected to want of punctuality even strictness in collecting rents
It may look very like the opposite of a grievance but to me it seems a grievance
When people are not kept up to the mark in this respect they are apt to fall into indolence and indifference with respect to the paying of their rents
I know a proprietor in Skye who has been very much spoken of for raising his rents
I believe he has raised them  but usually as he has raised them he has brought his people up to the mark in punctuality
He compels payment of rent and does not allow arrears and he has succeeded
I think there is a great deal in the power of the local gentleman or representative of the landlord in securing the regular payment of rents and that we are backward in that respect in Harris
That is my own idea of the state of matters in Harris
I would not lay much stress on the nonpayment of rent by the crofters if the people had land given to them
In too many instances I know the cause of the clearances has been to save the factor trouble
In Sutherlandshire they had a great deal of trouble in the collection of arrears when there were large straths to be visited at collection time
Well we know it is much easier to get rent from one tacksman here and there than have the bother of collecting it among so many
Now I believe that in many cases was the cause of the clearances in the Highlands
If local agents took greater pains their rent arrears would not be so much heard of
I have not sufficient experience to answer that but I know some cases where it would be no loss to the proprietor and I mention this case of Taransay
From my own knowledge of the ground I venture to say the proprietor would be no loser and there are other farms in Lewis where the same could be said
Not in my time
There were one or two individual cases and they have done very well indeed
They have
They had hardships at first but as soon as they got over these they got on
I believe a liberally devised scheme of emigration would be a good idea in connection with a land bill
I would agitate for emigration if I were pretty sure of those who wore left being better in their circumstances
I am quite prepared to say I think they would succeed in getting on could money be given on those terms
I do not mean merely that they should be assisted to go but that they should be looked after after going therethat they should have something like a home provided for them and secured from the risk of either starvation or too much hardship before they got under weigh in their new place
Yes a scheme of family emigration
I think so
But without the prospect of getting more land I think it would be a very unlikely thing to get them to emigrate of their own accord
Why there are  crofts I think in the civil parish of Harris exclusive of Bernera and in the same parish we have over  families living
That means  having no land living upon those  who have and while that continues we can have nothing else but poverty
But I scarcely think it would be possible to give land to all these
However much the Government could do however ready they might be to lay their hands on the property of those who have purchased those landswhich I do not think any Government could think of doingshould they give us all the land in Harris we would need an emigration scheme
I do not think there is land in Harris for  families and on that account I would say we would need a welldevised scheme of emigration in conjunction with a land billa land bill making it positively illegal to subdivide or sublet
Subdivision and subletting are the main causes of the poverty
Subdivision is forbidden on Sir Edward Scotts estate but it is carried out in spite of the factor and laird
Very difficult
There is very little difference from the rest of the people we have
It is the most crowded land we have
There are  lots and  families and  of those families having no lots are a burden on those who have
The difficulties in Scalpa are just the same with this exception that if the fishing is prosperous the people of Scalpa do not depend so much on the land
I would be disposed to think if some of them were exclusively fishermen in Scalpa they would get on better
I do not think any tenant in Harris has reason to complain of rent but should they have the land for nothing they would still be poor
I intended to mention that but for a branch of industry begun and carried on by Mrs Captain Thomas
I cannot say whether Mrs Captain Thomas or the Dowager Countess of Dunmore was first in the fieldbut for her efforts in connection with Harris destitution would be of more frequent occurrence than it is
That industry is web making and stocking making
From Mrs Thomass web making I believe the greater part of their living is derived
It has been far more remunerative than both land and fishing for the last three years
It would be unjust to Mrs Thomas not to mention her efforts for she is prepared to live and die for the islands
On Monday last she very nearly risked her life going to Taransay in a small boat and all from love to the people
The wife of Commander Thomas of the Royal Navyan English lady
To her we owe this Free Church Manseto her we owe this Free Church I may sayand a great deal more than I can mention before the Commission
Harris perhaps owes more to her than to anybody else
Yes my congregation extends to both
Just after Sir Edward came into possession
I believe it is an English custom
I do not believe Sir Edward was remonstrated with and I thought he should have been spoken to of it before bringing it here
He is one of the best proprietors in the Highlands and it is a great pity a syllable should be said here in any way to annoy him for he is a generous English man of the highest type and we should take care not to do anything to annoy him
I should be very sorry if this subject of leases accepted by the parties who now complain of them should be the means of giving him annoyance
However he is too sensible a gentleman to be angry with people for making known their grievances
I have seen it pretty often
I have not seen this years roll
I see that
Yes
Certainly but as to the possibility and practicability there is the difficulty
There is one thing I noted down viz the want of regular daily communication with a railway terminus to encourage the regular prosecution of the fishing
The post office department is to be blamed
Instead of giving us the mails sending them direct from Strome to Stornoway they are sent to a very outoftheway corner where there is no tradeto Ullapool
Now for an expense of  or  a year we could have a daily mail or a daily boat to all the fishing stations and in that way the people would be encouraged to go to sea regularly
They would get their fish carried away as soon as they were caught
It is scarcely worth a poor mans while to go to sea to get only eight or nine cod and ling
They get d or Is for them
If they could send away the fish fresh they would be worth double the money
The result is that men here do not think much of going to fish unless they get a large haul
The regular prosecution of the trade is what we want to be encouraged and this I take to be one of the most likely means  and another good effect likely to arise from that regular communication would be thisthe doing away with the ruinous credit systemruinous especially when it descends to the truck system which it almost invariably does
Not directly but there is a good deal of the nature of it
All round those islands
There was a letter by Lord Colin Campbell to the Times expressive of what we require and what the Government may well do in connection with the grievances in the Highlands
It is one of the most likely steps to improve our circumstances
Yes and there should be a good harbour on the west coast
The island of Taransay could be made a good harbour
There are only ten crofters thereno cottars
Mr Donald Macdonald who is a farmer on the mainland as well
It is not above the mark
I believe it holds true of North Harris as well as Harris generally
It is
I think I spoke of it alreadyboth emigration and giving them more landcutting up some of the large farms where such can be done without very great injury to the proprietor and my idea is that the proprietor would not suffer very severely
I would give it in the first instance to those who were able to take it upwho had means of stocking it and who had energy and perseverance to carry it on  and as to cottars who had no land and could not get any I would do all in my power to persuade them to go
No I think we could find among the cottars too a good many comfortable onespushing men with families who are able to work well when they get it to do who would be quite able with a little encouragement and some who by their labour might already have made a little means to stock a small farm
I hear the people speak of all the west side and the northwest
There is a good deal of Sir Edwards estate on the coast but it is not at all so probable or likely
I think nature seems to have intended Harris for a deer forest except the patches along the sea
In South Harris however yon have a great deal of good land capable of cultivation
Yes
I can scarcely say very much as to that further than the laying it out in connection with the shore groundgiving them some of the hill pasture
I believe but that for our deer forests the rental could not be what it is now
I do not know that they are so destitute of capital as to be unable to take small lots
Of course the proposal is that they should leave Government advances
That might be desirable but I do not think they could meet the interest
There are many who would make an effort to take and to stock them too
There would be a difficulty no doubt
I mean there would be such a quick return for fish sent away that the dealers could afford to pay at once
As matters are now the fish caught they have to cure and it has to lie on their hands for months and in that way they must have credit as well as give it to the people  whereas if they got the money for lobsters and other fish sent away at once they could pay the people with ready cash and the people could buy where they liked
Most certainly
I think it a financial mistake as well as an injustice to us
I notice in the newspapers there was a public meeting in Stornoway for the purpose of getting the mails direct to Stornoway
I do not know their petition contemplated what I mean viz getting the daily steamer to go round all those fishing stations
What they want is to make sure of Stornoway  but what we want is to get all the Outer Hebrides supplied from Barra to the Butt of Lewis including Loch Boisdale Lochmaddy and Tarbert
They would need one steamer to go to Stornoway and another to come round the south end of Skye and it might take the back of Skye across to Loch Boisdale and go back taking the islands
There must be two steamers at least but the increase of traffic would make the loss to the Government less
Quite
There are forty there paying rent and near sixty without any land at all
Yes
That the whole of these crofters and cottars are very very poor and very crowded and have hard times of it
Of these forty who have land the utmost that can be said of their crops is that they would support them about two months in the year
The whole of the populationcottars and croftershave to pursue the fishing chiefly lobster fishing and they have to be out summer spring and winter at least eleven months in the year
They have to go often from home and live in bothies and sometimes as far as Uist
Then everybody that can go to the east coast fishing goes thereto Wick
Immediately after their return from the east coast fishing they take to the home fishing
Some take to the long line fishing and others of them at the fall of the year to the lobster fishing
And then times are very hard
They have to go for manure to the Lewis shores and sometimes across to the Shiant islands near the mainland of Skye
Some of them go to the shores of Skye for the lobster fishing and upon one occasion when a crew of them set up a tent on one of the islands in Loch Snizort the tacksman to whom the place belonged came with his rifle and they were preparing their food at the time and he knocked down the pots and threw the food all over the place and threatened that unless they left the place they would be shot
The cause of all this is the excessive population of the place
They have fished their own shore clean and they have to pursue the lobster fishing at a distance
They also follow it up all the way to Lochmaddy
The island was formerly occupied by two or three tacksmen in succession before it was crofted out but these had to throw it up
When the factor found out that the tacksmen could not live there he settled it upon twenty crofters
When the twenty were there they were pretty nigh contented and able to make somewhat of a living out of it
Now Lord Dunmores commissioner at the time who had authority over the local factors was a Captain Sitwell
He came officially to see the lands
This man finding that this island was accessible by sea thought it might be advisable to make it a fishing community and so he added another twenty families upon the twenty who were there
When this second twenty was sent in the original crofts were subdivided among the forty
Then they began to fall back when this second twenty were sent to the place
Then when these forty were there and commenced to prosecute the fishing this man also thought proper that a curer should be sent there who would take all their fish from them pretending that this would be a great advantage to the community
This arrangement only lasted for a year
By this time the families of the original settlers were growing up and having families of their own
Their families were sharing their own small portions of land with them
The practice grew apace so that to make a long story short there are now if not a full hundred at least close upon a hundred families in the place through its having increased as I have described
There seemed to be no way by which this population could make a livelihood out of it at all but there was a native of the place who was able through Providence to set up a curing establishment and he provided for the people necessities and took from them the fish that they caught and it may be said of him that he has kept them agoing for the last twentyeight years since I came to the island
He provided them with boats and nets with which they were able to fish the Minchthe early herring fishing between here and Skyebefore they went to the east coast fishing
For the last two years this early fishing has failed completely and both curer and men suffered in consequence
Still although these things were so this man has provided for them so that although there was scarcely any expectation of any return it could be said that none of them went to bed hungry
He acted so in the expectation that things might mend
The fishing is a complete failure this year again and it is quite easy enough for you to understand that times must be hard in a small island with  souls upon the surface of it
Nearly forty years
About five years after the first twenty
I was born and spent the greater part of my lifetime at Strain near Rodel so that I can give a perfectly intelligible account of the circumstanecs
The first was MLeod of Bernera
The second was Hume his son who assumed the other name from his wife
The third was Alexander who reassumed the name of Macleod
It was he who lost the property
It went to trustees who sold it to the grandfather of the present Lord Dunmore
I meant to give three instances of the causes of the poverty of this place but to save time I shall give you the third only
I will tell you how Rodel was cleared
There were  hearths in Rodel
Forty of these paid rent
When young Macleod came home with his newlymarried wife to Rodel he went away to show his wife the place and twenty of the women of Rodel came and met them and danced a reel before them so glad were they to see them
By the time the year was outtwelve months from that day these twenty women were weeping and wailing their houses being unroofed and their fires quenched by the orders of the estate
I could not say who was to blame but before the year was out  fires were quenched
Some of the more capable of these tenants were sent to Bernera and others were crowded into the Bays on the east side of Harrissmall places that kept three families in comfort where now there are eight
Some of the cottars that were among these  were for a whole twelve months in the shielings before they were able to provide themselves with permanent residences
Others of them got through the favour of Mrs Campbell of Strond the site of a house upon the seashore upon places reclaimed by themselves
Fifteen families
Eleven hold land  four are without land
Yes
They are very much hemmed and crowded in but it is not an act of today
This overcrowding commenced seventy years ago and since that time we have had no relief
We suffer in a variety of ways
When I lost my land myself thirty years ago I turned my attention to the ocean to take my living out of the sea but I found bounds set before me in the ocean and I was not allowed to set a net with a smaller mesh than two inches within half a mile of any shore or bay or creek without incurring the risk of punishment in Lochmaddyany bay or creek or any place that could be approached by salmon or sea trout
But we have survived it all We who are without land are a burden upon those who have a little of it  and if it were not that they accommodate us out of their little by giving us potato ground we had long ago starved in a heap
I would wish you to understand that I dont mean to blame in the least our present proprietor or present factor
We were put into an impoverished condition long before the proprietor ever came to the island and if you would like to hear how our distress came about I can tell you
Donald Stewart was once factor under Macleod of Harris and it was then our troubles commenced
He began to clear the land and he began with Huishnish
He cleared seven townships at one stroke
His next move was to turn his attention to Macleod himself and devise how he could manage to make a fool of him and he succeeded because before the end came they used to a beggar
Macleod was latterly through his instrumentality reduced to such a poor condition that he actually obtained his support in Donald Stewarts own house
I have seen Macleod in the market in this very place leading a horse by the bridle and having no one that would wait upon him while Donald Stewart was making his hundreds by his cattle upon this mans lands
It was the next factorMacdonaldwho succeeded him that deprived me of my lands and he was not a whit better
The end of it was that my family when they grew up scattered into all parts of the earth and some of them are dead in a foreign land and others I know not where they areand I am alone
Hundreds suffered equally with myself
There are at least twice as many both in North and South Harris without lands as there are that have land
I think it is a sad condition of affairs in this place
There is not a family in the whole of Harris where there are two sons but one of them at least is in the service of the Queen perhaps two and neither they nor their fathers can obtain a foot of the soil upon which they could live
It would appear that when Britain becomes involved in a struggle with another nation in the future they must send for the deer and sheep of Harris as well as its young men and then they can see which is the best bargain
Thereby hangs a tale
There was a lady in Uist and a gentleman in Skye and my brother had a vessel and he came in the vessel with Donald Macdonald from Monkstadt and he went to Balranald in order to remove from thence the young lady whose parents were not willing that she should marry the young gentleman in the ordinary way
They wished her to marry the man who was at the time factor upon the estate but this man took her away
The factor Macdonald had his revenge upon me and my two brothers for this act though we were quite innocent of it
One of my brothers was at the time in Borv and another in Scalpa and I had a sister in West Tarbert
The four of us had lands at the time and he deprived us of them all
One of my brothers went to Australia where he is still
That is how I lost my landthe sole cause
I did not get lands since
Yes
I was  in arrears at the time but I had two cows and a quey and I offered to the factor to allow the ground officer to come and take possession of these for the arrears but he would not accept the offer
No none whateverexcept that I may occasionally get a patch from my neighbours
I have a cow and I pay a little for it to a good man that is in the place
Were it not for that I would be without any
They do not in the village
They have free houses
The proprietor allows them to build and does not charge them feuduty
They have no lease whatever and they are taxed meanwhile
There is another cottar as well as myself who has a cow
Occasionally
Yes we fish for anything that comes but occasionally cod and ling and in winter lobsters
I cannot exactly give the date but it would have been about that timethat is thirty years ago
I never thought that was the reason
The reason I thought was that I was prevented from using a smaller mesh than two inches in case I might catch a salmon or sea trout and thus deprived any of the young sportsmen who came to fish of such a luxury
We dont think that God created fish for the benefit of one man more than another and we would like to know by what right or title the one rather than the other can make a proper claim to that privilege
Yes there was a man in Urga that was taken to Lochmaddy and imprisoned there for transgressing this rule by placing the nets within prescribed limits and he told me after he came back that he would never recover from the effects of that confinement
They deprived him of his nets and they have never been restored to his widow to this day
Yes
In a good position
Yes
I cannot tell where they are
They are scattered over the world
Yes they can  I get letters from them now and again
Sometimes from the East sometimes from America sometimes from Africa  they are sailors
No
Yes he did  but my family did not wish to go
It is upon West Loch Tarbert about  miles from here
No I just live upon the march
Leuachar Deirisqir Cravadal Tuishnish Govaig Leosabay Amhainsuidhe
Yes
No a relative of his own from Loch Alsh named Alexander Macrae got them
In six of the townships there were thirteen families  as to Tuishnish I cannot say very well
It could keep six comfortably
It was in the possession of one man and he kept people upon it himself but it would make comfortable six families
He cleared the whole of the west side of Harris from Rodel to the head of Loch Eisorta stretch of over forty miles of shore
Some of them went to Lewis some of them were sent to the other side of Harris some to America some went to places never before occupiedalong between here and Rodel and if you could see some of these very places you would be surprised that even goats could live in them
I mean Finsbay and places less inaccessible than FinsbayCaolas Stocknish
It is quite impossible for me to tell you the number of souls that were dispossessed by that man out of these lands
There would be hundreds
He was a native of Appin and he came first to this country as a shepherd to the Park in Lewis and from the Park in Lewis he came here
He is not living now
Macdonald cleared Pabbay where twentysix families were
Some went to Australia some of them were sent to the east side of Harris
Stewart first packed them into these places and Mr Macdonlad repacked the placesthat is filled up the interstices
He also cleared the half of Bernera but I cannot tell how many families may have been there
John Stewart has Pabbay and Ensaythe son of this Donald Stewart of whom I spoke before
He is proprietor of both Pabbay and Ensay
The portion of Bernera under tack is I think in the hands of a North Uist man
He also cleared Lingivra Cuidinish Deiricleit Ceandevig
A large number of the people that left these places went to Australia and died upon the voyage
Some went to America some to Caolas Scalpa and to the island of Scalpa itself where they are now packed thick as herrings in a barrel
Deiricliet and Ceandevig are part of Lord Dunmores forest
A native of this placeDonald MLeodis the tacksman of Cuidinish
Lingivra was added to the farm of Rodel
No
Yes I knew some of them
Yes in very good circumstances
I knew no reason unless some of them may have been in arrears but I know that a large number of them were not in arrears
I never heard of such an attempt being made in this country
I did not know any such thing was being done at all at the time
I do not think he consulted the proprietor in the matter
He used his own authority and it was quite sufficient
The present Earl of Dunmore
I think he was a minor
No in no respect
Yes that was the belief in the place
Yes I believe it and will believe to the day of my death that that was the sole reason why I lost my land
I have no complaint as regards eviction or arbitrary removals within recent time
Yes
Eight years next September
Yes born in this township of Keose
Yes 
There are thirtyone paying rent and twenty other families that pay no rent
Yes
Yes
Yes
Gentlemen Our first complaint was to be driven away from Lochshell forty years ago
The fire was drowned on the hearths by the officers of the estate
They were fined  sterling for not leaving the villages on the appointed day
The people of the two villages were put to a smaller village than either of the two they were driven from
When the people came to Crossbost they had a small village five miles from Crossbost for herding it was taken from them and rented to another man and nothing taken off the rent of the village for it
Another piece of ground was taken from us at the end of the village rented for    s and nothing taken off the rent of the village for that
Four new crofters were set at the end of the village and paying rent to the estate and nothing taken off the rent of the villageDelegates for Crossbost ALEXANDER MACKENZIE and DONALD MACKENZIE
Twentyseven families
The rent of the township was   before we came to it
There was only one man there before we came to it
The rent was raised to  when we got it
Yes none of it had ever been cultivated except a little spot in the middle and there was only one house in the township when we came to it
So far as I remember it is 
Yes
If I recollect rightly that is so
No a great deal of the rights of the township have been taken from us
We have not
Yes
A very good place
We had plenty cattle and sheep there but it did not last long
I was in my fathers house at the time
About s
Four milk cows seven young beasts and about fifty sheep
Yes
The place was good
There was a good outrun or back
I cannot keep one cow today unless I pay for her food out of my pocket
I paid s formerly and it is now as high as  s including taxes
A cow with her followers for every   of rent is the summing
Five or six or seven per  of rent
I think twenty families and all its former rights should be restored so that we could make something of a living out of it
I dont know
They know that themselves
Yes
A very long way off
There is a ferry across the loch from here and five miles to walk afterwards
Yes
Roderick Martin
It is part of the farm of Oronsay
That is what we desire
Yes we would certainly try to do so
Yes  the place wo dd soon stock itself if there were a few put upon it
What is the good of keeping stock when if I have only one cow I have to buy food for it
There are two farms closing in upon us at the back and we are shut in like sheep in a fank
Twentytwo
No
Fifteen seven do not
Yes
Specially and in the first place the high rent of our township the bad soil and because of many things in connection with the management of the estate that bear hard upon us we are really not able to live in our place
Our first complaint is that a forest fence was set up and that we were deprived of our moorland pasture
No it was not we who put it up but we had to pay for it
Then at the time our present chamberlain entered upon office we got the promise that we would get the marches removed to the old boundaries
Then we really thought that we had the right to this moorland pasture and when we were driving our stock out to the grazings in order to give rest to the home grazings the gamekeepers met us and prevented us
They told us we had not the right without their permissionthat we were not allowed to send our cattle whenever we pleased out upon these pastures unless they gave us permission first
It was we also that paid for the herd that kept the fence there
Last year we did not pay him at all
Now there has been a fence herd appointed recently to look after our stock but we have very little stock now
The gamekeepers and the herd have drowned and destroyed both cattle and sheep
In order to find out whether this was gamekeeper law or chamberlain law I was appointed to meet the gamekeepers here about a month ago
The head gamekeeper upon the whole estate told me he had full authority to do whatever he pleased in the matter to which I replied that if he had such authority he might use it ill as he had already done
About the th of last month when we were in the very hurry of the spring work we saw the fire set to the moor and approaching our place so the constables were asked to go away and inquire who were the authors of this matter
We understood it was the gamekeepers
The constables refused to go
One of them went to Stornoway about the matter
He did not see Mr Mackay but he saw the head clerk in the office about the matter and what the head clerk told him was that the gamekeepers by a written authority obtained from the estate office might burn heather wherever they pleased
All I can say about it is that it is a most oppressive and terrible thing for us because this very place that was burned was the place that kept alive our cattle during the winter in snow time
The fire came into our peat moss near our crofts and some portion of the township was afraid even of their houses
We would be burning places that we did not think of much use but the place that kept our cattle alive in winter in snow time we would never think of burning
Well we have no grass and there is only soft boggy moorland without grass and we think that unless the sheep are able to crop the heather during snow time they cannot live at all
More than half of our moorland pasture was taken from us
Nineteen years ago
Yes it was beyond the dyke
The thing occurred the year that Mr Mackay led us to understand that our old rights would be restored to us but we never tried to send them over since then
The fence is in such a condition that you can trace it and that is all and the gamekeepers keep our cattle on this side of that fence yet
We could not very well understand the matter
We were sending the constables there and what occurred between them and the chamberlain we could not very well make out but we were dissatisfied with the whole matter and that is the reason we make it a foremost complaint here today
He is the head gamekeeper in the service of the estate
No our own stock are endeavouring always to get at it but there are no other stock
Yes it is a deer forestunder deer
I think it is we who pay for it
It belongs to the old rights of the township
That grazing was ours of old
Yes I think it is quite customary
The th and th of May this year
Yes we got that in some of the estate regulations that nobody could burn heather except upon certain days
We obey the regulation
It looks as if they did not for what they told us was that they would burn it whenever they pleased
We would understand that if really it was adhered to
The servant of the head gamekeeper
Duncan is his first name I dont know his surname
He is a stranger here
Between five and ten years
I cannot tell
We thought at all events that he broke a regulation that we ought to get the protection of
I have told already what happened when I was deputed myself to see the head gamekeeper in connection with another matter about a month ago and at that interview that man behaved himself as though he was over every person connected with the administrationso much so that I said to him it was time he should be looked after anyhowthat I myself as representative of other people was worthy of respect in my own position as much as he was in his
There is some of the place where the grass will never grow
It was of no use except for keeping alive the stock during snowtime
It was heather not grass
Some of it might be two feet long
Yes where it keeps a green top the cattle can live by it in places where they can get no grass
Yes that is quite true but we knew that this place would never grow grass
There was another spot on the same piece burned fifteen years ago and not a blade of grass has grown on it since
It is a black bog where the cattle go into it and where they are very much injured by it
The long heather grows upon the portion of the pasture bordering upon the sea
They should have come to us and asked if it was of any use to us before they burned it
At the time of the first rent paid to him as chamberlain
Yes I was one of two to whom he made the promise
There were three
One spoke and I was one of the other two
I did not remind him of it myself and I cannot be perfectly certain whether the constables did so or not
Yes we had an opportunity of reminding him of it but these gamekeepers told us they were acting under the authority of the estate
Well so far as regards complaints we had to bring to the estate office we were not more satisfied with the treatment we got there than the treatment we got from the gamekeepers
We have four miles to travel without an inch of a road
I was upon a wild winter night after being turned back by wind and tide watching a boat and the provisions in it which I was not able for want of a road to bring to my dwelling
We pay all the assessments that the people who have road advantages pay and we consider this a great hardship
Yes I heard part of that but the greater portion of his evidence was given before I came in
And now the deer come in upon us and we have to watch by night ever since the corn comes in the ear until it is stacked in our stackyard to prevent the deer from utterly destroying it
They commenced about five years ago and they are getting worse every year
 families in addition to paupers
Sixty
Yes
They were not all there
I was not there myself when I was chosen at the first meeting but there was a large meeting there and there was a second meeting at which I was present and those that were not at the first were at the second so that they agreed upon me
The Stornoway Association
I have written it myself
The one portion of it concerns the affairs of the township and the other concerns a matter of my own in which I was not dealt with in a Christian fashion
I read it to a large number of them
I did not get them all gathered to read it
It was not read at a meeting but to every one that met me
Some came to see it
Yes they agreed upon it one making one statement and one another and the substance of what they stated is in the paper
There were some statements they wished me to put in which are not there for fear of making the paper too large
No not at the meetings that were held in connection with this matter
I saw Mr Murdoch one day addressing the people
The minds of the people before the arrival of Mr Murdoch were stirred up in some way but until they heard him they did not even understand their own minds on this question so well as they did afterwards
Leurbost sixty crofts  families
Five of these crofts put in to make room for sheep farms increase about rents thirty years ago five shillings per croft
When the Road Act was passed five shillings was added to rents and hen money
Double renting commenced in  fine for Cleascro plantation fence   fine for Arnish deer forest fence   double poor rate paid in  Petty fines such as fining a man for a big lip
For instance widow Esa Maclver No
 Leurbost receipts can be produced to prove that she paid double poor rate in  Fined for Cleascro plantation fence in   fined for Arnish deer forest fence in  Two girls and three boys from Leurbost have been taken to the fiscals office under the control of a policeman for taking oysters out of the ebb in  mussels and wilkies were taxed
Those taxes were collected by Donald MacLeod crofter constable Balallan
Some years ago miles dyke fence was levelled to the ground by the ground officer
John Martin No
 Leurbost receipts can be produced to prove that he paid double poor rates in  and fined for Arnish deer forest fence in KENNETH MACDONALD delegate for the Leurbost crofters
They have other causes of complaint but these were what they consider peculiarly hard and oppressive
I believe that the whole people were dealt with in that way but these cases that are instanced are next door neighbours of my own and have submitted their receipts
Some of them may have a share of a croft but they are cottars
I can point out two
Then there are three new crofts that are rather small one of which I occupy myself
About thirty years ago
There were fiftyseven people before that and three new ones were added then
Four families were brought into the township in connection with clearances about the Park farm
There was another that was removed in order to make a sheep farm in another placethat is five
All the rest belonged to the place
Croirgarry
There was no additional land added to that tack by the removal of this man
He was either a crofter or cottar upon that tack before
They have each separate dwellings
We did not count those that lived in family with their parents
Yes that has been the regulation upon the estate for a long time back
I saw one built in spite of the regulation
I dont know whether others may have done it but this man was called to account for it
His fatherinlaw was summoned out of the land
Mr Munro made the peace by compelling him to pay   and Mr Munro threw down the house next year and the constable broke the furniture and everythiug that was there and scattered it over the place
The meaning is that there were people who were charged double rent in those years by Mr Munro and the practice of double renting then continued till Mr Munro got the management of the estate
I was born there

No it was only a piece of peat land that I got
 s or thereabouts
Yes
There are two families upon it but I believe that is the rent of a full croft
I think they have all a cow this year
There are some years when they lose a cow and are without one
There may be some that have three
About  or 
There are some without a sheep
Some say they are some again reclaimed bog land moor land and the crofters complain that these people have these places too cheap and on the other hand those men have expended labour and picks and spades upon the reck lined lots
Partly and partly rocky and stony places
It never yields such good crop when it is cropped every year but when you got clay to mix with the peat upon these lands and plenty manure in addition it gives good crops
Yes the rent is in proportion to the stock
The rent was fixed long ago and it was then fixed in connection with a certain amount of stock that was allotted to that lot
I heard nothing to the contrary but we might keep as much stock as the man who has a full croft at    if only we can keep that stock alive
No I did not hear them so much complain of the stock at all
They complain that their own rent is too high
I know one of my own knowledge
I know another whose rent was increased by   I am not aware of any fault he ever committed and this   is kept on to the present day
The case was this
The ground officer and the tenant differed and the tenant said to the ground officer that he would bring the matter before Sir James Matheson
That was the cause of doubling his rent and the double rent was exacted for eleven years
It was imposed in  and perhaps not paid till  and was exacted till Mr Mackay got the management of the property
Murdo Mackenzie
He is now dead
It is another Mackenzie who has come to his place
It is the poor rates I spoke of when I spoke of receipts
No but I know the thing was right
Yes I have got two
There appears to be one years poor rates in  Is d  and in  s d but there are arrears of s d and the poor rates of the year are s d as well
There was a constable exacting s d per bushel
I paid that myself for a Stornoway merchant
The man who shipped them
Not at that time but matters changed afterwards so that they were obliged to give up their whelks to one man
I had to cease purchasing them
The constable came to me with a written document telling me I was obliged to give them up
In Mr Munros time
I dont know what the practice was at the time I was made to cease purchasing them
The men used to say then that they farmed the shores for gathering whelks
Twentythree families have land and there are twelve in addition without land
Yes
Yes except some who were at sea
Yes
The one thing we want is relief from the present overcrowding and if land could be got to those who have it not that would relieve in a great measure those who at present possess it
If things continue as they are it is my firm belief that we are on the verge of extinction through poverty
They all belong to the place except one
I pay  s of bare rent and taxes in addition
The schoolhouse was built on my croft
No
Two cows a stirk and five sheep
About 
About   
Yes without cow or sheep
There is one man in that condition
Yes
I cannot say for all of them but some of them certainly have
Yes
Yes
Cod and ling and sometimes herring
Yes
Most of them have big boats
Five and sometimes six
There are some of them that are secured by the curers others are swallowed up in debt some of them are their own property

Without the nets
It is the boat with mast and sail but without nets
From everywhere
No but they sometimes have a curing station for cod and ling
They used to have a curing station for herring but the herring have left the place and they have withdrawn the station
d and d for a ling and d and d for a cod
Yes we make our bargain at that time
The man who is able to make his own purchases independently of the curer can go where he pleases to purchase and the curer pays him in money
I have not bought a boll of meal from the curers myself for a long time but what I hear said is that the meal that is purchased for s is given out on credit for s and sometimes as high as s
Yes they sell it for the same price as a shop for ready money
Some know the price at the time they take away the meal and some do not
There are different times at which these settlements are made
For the herring fishing they make a settlement before they go to the east coast fishing but for the cod and ling fishing they very often make a settlement when they return from the east coast fishing about the autumn
Many of them do
Many of them keep no account either of what they sell or buy
They have entirely to trust to the curer only their own memory assists them more or less
They sometimes do
Nothing nearer than the Park
No the townships of both Gravir and Garivard come in between us and the march with Park
Even if that were done the place would not be comfortable unless some of the crofters were removed as well
It would make perhaps twelve families comfortable
Yes that is quite the case before those who remained would be comfortably off
My memory does not go so far back there were six lots originally
It was made into twentythree lots
I believe when it was in six lots there were two families to every lot and I believe there were even more
About four years ago
There have been four years and there has not been a complete settlement of rent since that time
Yes
I heard I got s of reduction
I heard that from my neighbour who got s of abatement for a bit that he lost in connection with the building of the schoolhouse
Well the chamberlain and myself differed about the crops
I sowed the place after the site was marked out because I did not know when the schoolhouse would be built and I went with the rent and paid it and I cropped it again and I did not know that I was to be disturbed in any way uutil I could remove the crops from the ground
Then they came and cut down my crop
Well I brought two constables to look at it and they valued the damage at    s
This was within the fence
Well the chamberlain would pay me no portion of this amount
I then went to the contractor who built the school
I asked him if he would pay me
He said it was the chamberlain who ought to pay that amountwas I so blind as to think it was his business to pay itthat it was his duty to pay for a school site for them
That was the cause of the difference with respect to the rent
I dont think that anybody would expect anything else than to pay a reasonable rent
So far as I judge I dont know that they have much expectation of that from the proprietrix
Yes they would
So far as I have heard of the rents that the sheep farmers pay I believe that the crofters would be willing to pay an equal rent
I can only speak for myself in that matter
My own view would be to value the land and have a reasonable rent placed upon it by people appointed by both the proprietor and Government
I dont think that the people would covet it
They would leave it with the deer as they had it of old
Well the fact is that I was myself for a long time in this Park and I saw that the sheep and deer herded there together and the people were paying their own rent in proportion to the amount of ground they occupied
I dont think the tacksman would covet the place without having the uplands as well as the low land
I cannot say but my opinion is that he would
It is he who would covet the hills if only he got low land as well
The former tenants of Park were very well off when they had the upland as well as the low land
Aldinish of which you have spoken was a small township
There were only three tenants in it and when they left it they took away twentythree cows each out of it
That is a hard question but if once they got upon their feet they would be glad to do so I mean if they got assistance
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
I dont know the west side
Glencloich
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
The shepherd with whom I was employed would name at least thirty
I have no idea
I believe there would be but I have no knowledge whatever of the west side
No
Yes
He gave me no money and he said it was not he who ought to supply me with money
Nothing
Sixtyeight
Fortyfour paying rent
Yes
Yes
Themselves
The Stornoway gentlemen did not come down to see us at all but we met immediately when we heard of the appointment of the Commission and that delegates were to be chosen
Yes it was the people themselves who prepared that statement
Yes the writer read it to them
Probably about forty
A next door neighbour of my own who is a good scholar and has a brother who is a master of arts
He is at present acting as schoolmaster in the place
Well we may and we have for many a long day
That is one of our great complaints
Three times they sent a petition
Yes
Yes
Yes
I cannot give the purport but the letter itself can be produced
So far as I understand all the papers are there and you yourselves can judge whether there is a threatening letter among them
I myself am of belief the people have not threatened
I am convinced they uttered no threats  but it may be put in this way that if they did not get their request they might persist in asking it 
No I never saw the reply from Lady Matheson
I got more than one petition and I sent them to Lady Matheson
No
There was a petition presented to me at one time which I sent to Lady Mathesona second petitionand I remarked to the people that Lady Matheson had refused it already and it was in vain to apply but that I would send the petition
They remarked that they would have it should they lose their blood
By word of mouth
Roderick Martin tenant of Crobeg who was formerly in Balallan has it
Crobeg is  and he tells us that he pays  for the other
Yes quite capable of putting suitable stock upon it
Yes by getting the same area that he has
He has some islands along with a bit of mainland that we wanted
No
I can give the east side portion
There are people there just now
I saw it cleared but it was peopled again
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes I cannot give any more
No but I know there were a good many but the people were not so thickly planted then as now
All I have to say is in the paper
I can give you the substance of the paper in a few words
The sum and substance of it isGive the land to the people on such terms as they can live by it under just administration and without any oppression in any shape or form
The people will never attain to the comfortable condition in which I saw them unless they will get some relief in that way and cease from being crowded upon one another as they are at present
There is another matter
We are within a quarter of a mile of the march of the tacksmen that have now occupied the place for forty years and they have destroyed our stock not only what the two shepherds at the march have done with two dogs each but we also require ourselves to send forth one lad from each township
Everybody upon the south side of the loch knows that as well as I do
We require to send forth a man and to pay him and this shepherd ruled over him as his master the object attained being the destruction of our stock
They have no stock
I remember that when the township had fortytwo tenants it had more stock than it has now with sixtyeight
We occupy a headland of the sea and we are faced continually by shepherds and their dogs at the march and of all the men that ever was thrown in upon us the last comer is the greatest scourge of them all
I have got myself thirtyfour years ago and I have not seen an old sheep of my own they all come to death before their time
The shepherds upon one side and our own engaged herds upon the other destroy them between them
There is a remedy
The land in which we live is not without suitable land for cultivation and suitable tenants to occupy it
Some people may say that Park is not suitable for tenantry but I remember the men that left it
They were old men when I was a boy and to the day of their death they used to mourn their removal from Park and willed to go back to it  so that if the quite sufficient land there is fairly distributed among the people and wisely distributed there is plenty room for them to make a comfortable living in their own land
That  was not ordained by ourselves but the land which God created was ordered by Himself
Well we would not ask it in that way
We would ask that those who are the actual possessors of it should live by it as well as we
They have the right of proprietorship and it is their duty to administer it wisely
Mr Sellar
There was a very bad thing that was done in connection with his tenancy too
There was a shepherd he had for twenty years and though he had  sheep himself after his service this shepherd would not get a foothold upon the whole of his farm but had to be sent in upon our township
He paid rent to the proprietor and we paid rent to the township as well
His master would not even give him the site of a house
I have seen another case in our township
The land was divided into three bits and a man was taken in from a neighbouring township Maravaig and given the one third of this lot and a rent of s was put up in it which this man had to pay and the old tenant with twothirds paid the same as he had paid for the whole holding
Yes there were  sheep on it
I am certain  the manager told me so
The manager told me  but I myself believe that the place could carry more sheep than that only of course they would not have the same grazing accommodation that the tacksmen would allow by keeping only
Our own herd was obliged to do what the other shepherds on the other side of the march told him
To help them to drive the crofterssheep over the march and to worry them as they please
Yes and his sheep crossed over to ours
Yes but in some places they use the stock better than in other places
Yes they would go for them at shearing time and at smearing time
I have seen them on our ground for six months on end but no doubt they would be driving them back
We did not drive them back as a rule neither did our herd
Yes we did not drive them back and we did not make a remonstrance
We sometimes helped the shepherd to get them or the like of that
That is quite the case
We did not retaliate in any way and the people here can testify to that
I speak of the past so far as the administration of the estate is concerned but there is no question whatever we were oppressed by this last incoming tenant
It is the greatest oppression we ever had
Well it is the greatest oppression we have got
Roderick Martin
I include in this oppression of which I speak the excessive crowding in together of the people in small holdings
Yes that is also a thing of past administration and not of today
About fortythree
Yes
About a fortnight ago
We took steps upon our own part before the Stornoway gentlemen came
No
Yes after the election
Mr Murdoch took part
It was written after that meeting but the paper was prepared before the meeting
Right Honourable Gentlemen Being called upon to narrate grievances from Laxay the township in which I reside I herewith take the liberty to say in the first place that my age is  years that I came to Laxay at the age of eight along with my father and other ten crofters who were driven away with all their belongings from their thriving and agreeable holding at Aline and Park in which they knew nothing beyond prosperity and happiness
Park which nature seemed to mean for man with all its arable lands hill pasture and bays of the sea offering grand opportunities of comfort as a reward to human industry was quite unprecedentedly relieved of the inhabitant population of twentyeight townships
To the perpetrators of such deeds the discontentment and bitter feelings of the fugitive inhabitants appeared as nothing at all compared to the peculiar pleasure they enjoyed from the fact that now the sheep and the fleetfooted deer could graze on the meadows and on heaths impiously depopulated
Some of these men were evicted to America others scattered here and there at home on small patches of land in the lessthoughtof districts
A crofter having the misfortune of falling under the displeasure of factor or ground officer however innocent the poor man may be has not the ghost of a chance of getting along uninterrupted
As an illustration of this I can say I knew of a person a crofter in this village who was compelled to abandon three different holdings and three different new houses which he built in the sweat of his brow on three consecutive years without even a kind word in the way of aid or compensation for his labour time and expenses
There is another man still living here who underwent a similar disagreeable process
The deer and sheep began their chase upon him at three or more different places at Uig drove him over to Carloway and he had been no sooner there than the land was considered too good for man at least for such as crofter population and so to make room for sheep the poor man was turned out and the said individual had to make another painful flitting
When we came to Laxay as already referred to we found seven crofters there
Then it was divided into seventeen crofts at the rent of  Soon however   more was added to the rent of the village and five shillings road money and one shilling for hens which is looked now upon as natural rent
There are now twentynine crofts the latest of which is placed in our pasture way
The land is now almost entirely exhausted by continual ploughing this with high rent and taxes in some cases together with subdividiugs of crofts make the prospects of the crofter very dark and hopeless
Mr MKay the present chamberlain has committed very gross injustice upon a sister of my own who with peculiar industry kept her croft in good order and paid rent regularly cruelly turned her out of the croft six years ago and would not accept its rent from her
She was blind and helpless  they never inquired after her
I had to take her to myself when the land she had was given to another man see Appendix A
XL
It is high time Parliament should make an investigation as to the cause or causes of grievances amongst Her Majestys most loyal subjects in the Highlands and especially in Lewis where factor and ground officers pretend to be in absolute and arbitrary power and labour hard to keep people in perpetual awe of their own importance not of course denying them their proper places
We herewith suggest respectfully some of the remedies necessary for our wellbeing and comfort
To obtain the arable land and hill pasture now under sheep and deer at fair rents fixity of tenure and compensation for improvement
Park which keeps  sheep and an innumerable amount of deer would of itself if given to our enormous number of cottars and others meet a vast deal of what is needed
Yes about that time
There were other townships that were cleared since that time within the farm of Park Oronsay Cleater Stiomara and Shealdinish
A voice from the crowd says fortyfive townships but I am not prepared to say there were more than twentyeight
I can speak to four townships that have been cleared since that time and that are now included in the farm of Park
I lived far away and I cannot give accurate information upon that matter but there are many here who can
 See Appendix A XL
Some of them came to Crossbost some to Grimshader and some to Balallan
Crossbost was under a tacksman at the time
Balallan was under crofters
Grimshader was also under crofters
One of them was a large farm at the time and the other two were under crofters
The greater portion of them went to the place that formed the large farmCrossbost
The land to which they were removed was less in extent
Quite sure
I was not of age to judge as a tenant myself at the time but the land that they left was roomy enough
It yielded good crops and there was plenty of room for good stock
Yes
The land is good enough of its kind but then it is so thickly peopled that it cannot do good as it is used
Off and on about forty years ago
Yes I can remember of some tenants coming in upon ourselves where I lived from the other side of the country over in Carloway a place called Dallmore
Yes
The increase is due partly to the natural increase of the place and partly to people coming in from the outside
Probably about ten years ago was the last
From Balallan
The man was not able to get a place there
Yes
There was a place called Lemora that was cleared and afterwards reconstituted with crofters Oronsay Stiomara Eesgin Bunish CeanlochAlich
It is only one that would be particularly acquainted in that district that could recite all the names
Seaforth Stromas Sgealadale
I can scarcely give any more I was but young at the time
John Smith a previous witness could give almost the whole of them
I cannot tell people were not so numerous then as they are now
They were spread over the place
I should think there would be more than that
Alexander MLeod
In Seaforth
He is not living now
Yes he was in Seaforth first
He was building a new house every year of the three and Seaforth was the first
Then the next year he was sent to Ardentrean
Yes and he gave him a place there for a year
Yes he got leave to build a house
From himself
Yes
Angus Morrison
In Laxay
He came to our parish when Chamberlain Mackenzie lotted the place
Yes
It was in Dallmore at Carloway that he built it
I cannot tell anything of that but I know that he came into our place in room of some of those who went to America
It was by an act of highhandedness that he was removed from Dallmore
Some of them did  some did not
There were some who did not get places but were sent to Stornoway and elsewhere
Yes to those who came to hear it
A lad belonging to the place wrote it
It was myself and others who composed it
The lad himself is responsible for the English
Yes he was for a while a student
No she is weak and blind
She was able to keep up the place
She had a servant
No she was not
The rent was sent back to her and she was driven out
She was not a penny in arrear
Nothing except that she was now growing old and that it would not be left with her any longer
Yes like her neighbours
Twenty families
Yes
The most of them were together
There are three townships there very near connected to each otherHabost Kershader and Garivaidsmall villages situated on the south side there and I was appointed to speak on behalf of these
The main grievances which the people have there are the smallness of their holdings and the badness of them as well and that makes them dearnot dear according to the space may be that we possess but according to the hard labour we have in connection with them and the badness of the soil so that the ground would not yield crop now as it would before because the places are peopled so much and each family has so little of it
Besides that we have a general grievance on the south side for the want of any bit of road
We have not an inch of road and we are paying according to other tenants in the country the same road money that they are paying to the best of my kuowledge
Now we have not an inch of road there and I think there are several hundred families there on the south side
This same year we applied in some form or another to get a road there
That was refused
I cannot say who in fact was the author of refusing it but one thing is we are in want of it and we are paying for it
Another thing they were anxious to state before the Commission is a rise of rent that took place some years ago
There was s charged upon each tenant for road money
Well after a few years I think it was turned as moor pasture money upon the people and the road money besides
To the best of our knowledge this s is included now in the present rent we pay and the road money besidesso much per pound
Now bad as the soil is if the people had somewhat more of it a little more than they have they might of course no doubt with hard labour make a poor mans living of itnot very luxurious or easy and I can prove that when a man goes there with a creel on his back all the days of his life with his spade in his hand working with the spadeand very often when I was a fisherman I had to go down with my sea boots to the knee in the furrows of the rigs where I was putting a little seed to turn it before I could put in seed there
Now today I am cutting my peats in the rigs that I had twenty years back under cultivation and today they will give no crop and the best I can make out of them is to cut them in bits to burn
I am sure the worst grievance we have is that there are so many squatters there and though the tenants suffer very much from that condition the squatters suffer more
I dont know what life I could compare to a poor mans life squatting there because to my great misfortune I was there for a long time myself and I suffered for it and I suffer for it still and I have no person to blame for it but myself for I was a long time in that condition
Matters with us at present are not so very bad no doubt but still our taxes and everything of that sort are unbearable to the poor people
They cannot stand it
We had seaweed there and some of that was taken from us and the rent was not reduced to my knowledge
I dont think that it was
The only remedy that they expect to get for that is if Lady Matheson kindly would think to give more land to these people that are distressed there
While we have to acknowledge Lady Mathesons kindness in every wayas Mr Mackay referred to that we must acknowledge it especially this year and other yearsbut still the burden is upon the people in a way that they cannot bear
They cannot live in any way like a free kingdoms subjects
If they can it is out of any of our knowledge how to do unless we get some more land
Now the land next to us on the south side here is quite fit for poor people and I will give you one instance
My grandfather was in Park before he was removed to make a place for sheep and deer
Well one year he got   for twenty threeyearold wedders
The other people of the township were envying him for getting so much
I mention that as an example to show that the land is quite fit for a poor man to live in it and to give more rent
As the first witness spoke about his nephew who went to America I may say that the boy left our place and the witness will excuse me when I say that he did not go back to help his father but he was of necessity forced to go back to his fathers house for he joined the Hudson Bay Companys service as a hired man and he did not succeed there and then in the process of his way to Hudson Bay he had to go back to Canada to his fathers house and was not there but for a short time
That is a trustworthy man Donald MLeod from the township of Kershader and I had a letter from a neighbour there telling me of the poor condition of Donald MLeod a man we could believe as far as we could believe any man we ever saw and many here who can testify the same
Now we cannot think of going there in the face of all this
And now the fishing of the sea is taken away in the course of the providence of the Most High
We may acknowledge that our sins are the author of it but for all that we are suffering on that account and we earnestly wish not to blame any proprietor or chamberlain or ground officer but we might mention if it were necessary many instances that could show that we were suffering in connection with these things
Perhaps it will be better for this present meeting not to enlarge upon them
But the remedy for the distress is the main thing we are asking and that is the only remedy the people think would do themto get a road there and to get more landand I hope whatever shall be the result we sbaU not have to pay more or any longer for what we have notI mean the road
About the seaweed I cannot exactly say how it was but we got the moor pasture and the seaweed in the rent before it was raised and we possessed it up to a certain year and s or s for each crofter was added to our rent and we are paying that still
Lady Matheson no doubt gives money in charitable ways but to the best of my knowledge not a penny was spent in the three small villages I have mentioned for houses or improvements yet
If there was I will admit very soon that I was wrong but only this for which we sincerely thank herwe had a schoolhouse and once or twice she gave us a little help in timber to keep up the schoolhouse
We acknowledged that and still acknowledge it with gratitude
On the south side of this loch
About  miles going round the loch
Not an inch
Yes the ferry across will shorten it with us but not with the rest of the district
There are several townships all round there where there is not an inch of road nor is there a postoffice on the south side nor any civil benefit whatever only we have got one church there and one churchyard very lately
Yes
I think there was a postman going
They would be left on the south side with some person on the road and all the townships there and I have to pay extra for all the letters we get
It is in Balallan in the most inconvenient place for the parish that can be
No  it is in Balallan in the furthest end of the loch but there is another office at Crossbost that is accommodating the district
I must send for them or pay extra to the man who would go for them
About twenty
I say so and I can prove that
They are away to the fishing to earn wages and to any place where they can get a job
To the east coast and to the south to Badenoch and to Glasgow and any place where they can get work
They have no certain ruleas long as the party who employs them agrees
Yes
Yes they do
Most of them have
Some pay it to the crofter whose ground they are on and some pay no rent at all
Most of them have grown up in the place
Yes the most of them
Yes I do
Yes
Yes
That same was not capable of improvement
I did my best to improve it since I had it and it is not fit to yield any good crop
Yes of course but not according to the expense
I think between  and  families
I believe it is
Yes they have not the benefit of an inch of road
There are some arrears in the townships I represent
Yes
Yes it was raised in the days of making the lots by Munro Mackenzie
Yes
Yes for a short time
I was a fisherman and my health failed
Yes
Those who were going among the people from out of Stornoway
Those who were at the head of the Stornoway meetings
Mr Morrison and Rev
Mr Martin and Mr Mackenzie who is here present
Statement of Balallan People
We beg to lay before the Commissioners the way in which Balallan has been so badly ruled
JOHN SMITH senior DONALD MARTIN ALEXANDER MKENZIE JOHN MACLEOD JOHN SMITH junior

 s
Exclusive of taxes
Yes it includes that
That was the only permanent rise of rent that he imposed
There were temporary impositions
In one case the rent was doubled because one kept a married son
There were twentysix lots when Sir James Matheson bought the property
There were a few of them that had two families upon them
No only upon a few
No there were none brought in from the outside since Mr Mackenzie lotted the place
There was a large number shortly before that and there were additions made to the lots by Mr Mackenzie by giving lots to some of the people of the place
Yes
They grew upon the placethe natural increase of the place
No there is no place for them
They are a burden to the place and they injure it very much
Yes
We dont know very well
We used to consider America as the place to go to but now through the favour of Lady Matheson and her representative Mr Mackay we think that a place might be provided for them in the land of their birth
I dont think they would
There were many of our relatives who went to America and we have not heard such favourable accounts of how they got on
No they had not the means to bring them home
Yes
My father was the only one of my grandfathers family who did not emigrate and the arrangement they made with him when they went away was Dont stir from where you are till we send for you and he never got a letter from them but the tenor of it was If you are as well off as you were when we left you dont stir out of it
I heard from a son of my own not very long ago and a sister of my own
There was an unmarried nephew of my own who came across here some years ago and stayed with me for a while and returned back again and I heard from him too
To support his father and mother
They had no means of support without him
In CanadaI cannot specify furtherbut he used to tell me this that when people gathered together from all parts the Highland people as they are here today the burden of their conversation was the old homes they had left behind them and they all say that if they could they would return back again
Yes
Sometimes they might be pretty comfortable
I met with a trustworthy man who went away at the same time John MLeod by name and when I asked him about my sister and her husband his reply was that my sister and her husband did not get much satisfaction or comfort in America
They were but young at the time and the proof of their discomfort he gave me was that their heads were as white as a seagull mourning for the land they had left behind
No he was born at Kershader
Fourteen or fifteen years of age
There used to be when herring came into it
There is very little fishing except when there are herring
Providencethe administration of the Creator
Clearing Park in order to place it undersheep
Archibald and Alexander Stewart two brothers
I was born in Park in a place called Eesgin of Park
About fifteen
He was one of those who were sent away from the place
Yes as well as a crofter tenant might need to ask
Quite the contrary but because of the oppression of the peopledealt with as a herd of sheep driven by dogs into a fank
Yes
Nobody needed to leave the place from one years end to another for anything the family required
If one family happened to be short of provisions they had only to ask their neighbour who could supply them
Nobody stood it so well as my father did
He had means and he got into a place until he was banished a second time
He came to another portion of Park called Cleater over upon the other side of the loch from Balallan
He had Cleater to himself for nine years and then another man was put in who got twothirds of it and my father for five years had onethird
He was fourteen years there altogether
He was one of the sixteen who were removed to Balallan when Mr Scott became tenant of Park
This was before Sir James Mathesons day
Yes those of them who were not sent off to America
Others of them were sent to Tongue down near Stornoway
Yes
He has net very much landabout two lots
Yes
It was made before he got it
It was cut out at the time Mr Mackenzie portioned out the place into lots
No  the arrangement was this that the rent of the township was apportioned out among the lots these two lots paying their share of the rent as well as ourselves
Yes
Nothing whatever he is just as another neighbour
Yes
Six persons
Yes
There are twentyeight lots in the township but there are many of them on which there are more than one family
Yes
We were told the meeting was to be in the Free Church of Garabost
We heard it about a fortnight ago in the town here
I remember when the township was under twelve tenants
That is forty years ago
The rent was  There are now twentyeight lots and the rent is above   but a dyke was made round the arable land by orders of the proprietor and a tax of s was made on every lot of which there were twentyone at the time thirtyfour years ago
It was erected by the proprietor and the people were paid for doing the work but the crofters have had to keep it up ever since
A promise was made at the time that when the dyke was paid for they would be free from any further expense
It cost about  and already there has been   paid for it
Then there was a tax of s put upon every crofter for the roads
The s for the roads was then changed into hill money
Both these taxes are now included in the rent and if anybody sends a cow to the hill he pays s for the grass for a month or six weeks
When I became a family man I built a house for myself close to my fathers and I was fined   by the chamberlain for it
I went to the chamberlain and told him I would rather go back to my fathers house than pay that but he would not let me off without paying the fine
There were other four of my fathers family and when they saw how things were going on under the chamberlain they fled away with the exception of one
The boundaries of the township are now no larger than they were when they were paying  Instead of that they lost something out of the back of the town
Yes
When our land was allotted under the present proprietor it was done by Mr Scobie
At that time there were six families at the end of the township where I am and my brother was on the lot which I now occupy
His rent was then    s
The land was taken from us at that time for a curing station spreading places for nets and accommodation for boats
There was a deduction of s from our lots and some of the other lots on account of that for some time
But after Mr Scobies time that s was laid on us again when the lots were next settled by Mr John Mackenzie the rent of that ground which my brother had and which I now occupy was raised to  s and to make my story short I paid this year    s d for that same ground of that s was paid on account of road money I had not been paying before
On the same ground on which I remember my father and mother keeping five cows I keep two and another young beast and I have difficulty in keeping them
About 
When I came into possession of the land the bare rent was  s
Then there was s added to that for road money
It is now part of the rent and when I objected to that there was a fine of s put upon me
I would get no receipts from Mr Muuro until I paid that s
It was Mr Munro who put that fine upon me
I held on for two years without paying it and I would get no receipts till I paid it
No
The rulers of the estate know that I do not
Yes  s is the bare rent now
Yes that is for grazing which our fathers had for nothing
Two cows and a young beast and six ewes
Yes
I have been appointed to appear before the Royal Commission by the crofters and fishermen of this district to state their grievances
First crofters are overcrowded
In many instances three families are in the same croft
The land is poor and they have too little of it
Second they suffer heavily for want of harbours to prosecute the fishing
Portnaguirin is one of the oldest and best fishing ports and there is from  to  fishermen depending upon it for the most part of the year and is still neglected and left in its natural state consequently the fishermen have to load and unload from a ton or two tons of ballast and then haul their boats from  to  yards every time they go to sea and owing to the roughness of the shore and want of protection the boats that ought to last them ten years will only last them for three
There is no doubt if there was a harbour they would have larger and better boats and could land twice the quantity of fish
Third we suffer from want of telegraphic communication to the fishing ports so that we cannot have ready communication with the southern markets which now would be of great advantage to the fishermenANGUS MACLEOD delegate
Yes
Yes  even a pier would be better than nothing but a harbour is much required
Not very easy
Yes
That or Gress
Portnaguirin is a much more important fishing place
Perhaps twenty to twentyfive for cod ling and lobsters during the year and if there was a harbour there would be many more
I have to say that there have been rights taken away from the township to which I belong which they possessed before
Thirtyfour years ago our land was so much abridged that we have nothing outside the heads of our rigs between us and the sea on the other side
We have no pasture ground at all
The little we had between us and the sea was taken away from us and a wire fence was put up between us
I believe all through the bounds of this estate you would not see a boundary so disagreeable to look at as ours and we are now every year obliged to keep up and pay for the cost of that wire fence
Yes
No some years afterwards
It was given to the person who has it today Mr Houston Goramclete
No
Mr John Mackenzie
Not a penny it has been raised upon us since that time
More than   
Yes there was a bit of land given to us for which we have    s to pay but it is now a thoroughfare for the cattle of the place and all the sand that is used in and about the place is taken out of it so that carts are constantly going up and down there
We did but what was the good of that
If a complaint was made to the chamberlain the chamberlain just raised his stick to the man who made it
Parties who have Murray grazing lands outside the boundary of Stornoway
Yes
Under the Seaforth family the town had from  to  head of cattle and about two square miles of moorland to graze them on
This moorland extended almost in a straight line from the Stornoway mill to the Creed river north and south of the Lochs road
That portion of the moorland to the south was used for wintering and that to the north for summering
The rent was s per head of cattle always paid in advance
The townspeople had arable ground in Goathill rented to them in rigs or acres at from    s to  sterling per Scotch acre
Dykes were made by the tenants
Some of the townspeople had three head of cattle and a goodly number had two
These having lands used to have potatoes all the year round grown on their own lands besides some oat and barley meal
The people were comfortable and well to do
There was no poor rate or its demoralising tendencies good schools and good scholars without an expensive and cumbersome School Board system no police and no police rate only one lawyer in the Lewis and he not overburdened with work
Until recently we always had a Gaelicspeaking sheriff
The Lewis under the Seaforths was happy and contented well fed well clothed and imported little if any meal or food of any kind
The old potatoes saw the new in the surplus of grain they were able to sell was sufficient to keep a large distillery going in Stornoway and no small number of illicit stills and every man made his own homebrewed nutbrown ale
The legal and illicit stills are gone long syne and poverty has made the crofters forego their nutbrown ale
Tradesmen and crofters put aside each year their winter stock of beef and mutton
The crofters were able to sell in town their own butter
Neither butter nor cheese was imported the island producing sufficient for its wants
They did not know what it was to want
In those days the few poor were as well fed and clothed as their neighbours who from their own fulness supplied those who were indigent
There was no word in those days of the lazy Lewisman
They got sufficient land to keep them employed and sufficient returns from it to keep them out of debt
No wonder that the past generation spoke of the Seaforth family with affectionate reverence
The late Sir James Matheson bought the island of Lewis in June  and in November of the same year deprived the townspeople of all their summer grazings and began to enclose the same and to plant it with young wood
This portion is now called Lewis Castle policies
The town being now confined to their summer grazings the inhabitants saw it was hopeless to keep on their stock and gradually began to sell them off
A few years thereafter the Goathill lands were gradually taken from them park by park until about  they had no arable land on Goathill
No compensation was given for dykes or improvements
All that the townspeople have now are two parks in Goathill for grazing
One park of about  acres paid a rent of  which this year was reduced to the other park of  acres paying  s The number of cattle on these parks is fifteen The Goathill lands were attached to the Manor farm and to the Goathill farm
About  the estate took Goathill farm into their own hands and turned it into a dairy farm and shortly after raised the price of milk
The price of milk all the year round prior to  was fourpence per half gallon
In  the price was raised by the estate management to sixpence per half gallon from November to May and back to fourpence from June to October
The milk supply comes now from the farms of Goathill Melbost Holm and Stoneyfield
Goathill since  is in the hands of a tenant
As regards evictions the last of them occurred about five years ago in widow Park
I shall also ask leave to call attention to some remarks made on the crofting system which has never been properly handled by any one
The total area of the Lewis is  acres
The inhabitants of the town
They had these lands outside the town
Some of them were crofters in a sense of the word others were tradesmen who had a bit of crofttwo or three acres
They were tradesmen and the lands were a help to them and they feel the want of them now
Yes
For the purpose of making parks and he lotted it into farms
Part was given to the Home farm and part to the Goathill farm the remaining three parts were given to the townspeople
Part of the hill is attached to the Goathill farm and part is attached to the manor farm
Three parks are held by parties in the town for grazing purposesat least two for grazing purposes and one is arable
They had not any of these lands before
Yes
Yes
Some families dont use all  the milk they sell the surplus
No
There are fifteen cows belonging to the town in those parks
That is so
Yes
No reason alleged
There was no reason for taking it for the use of the policies or giving it to the farmers
The ground was well tilled
I do not think there was much use in doing so
It would be very wise if there was any chance of getting it
I think so
It used to be rented to the township at from s to s per imperial acre
As to the parks that are already let one is let at   per acre the other at about  s
It is mostly used by the family that owns the cow
Some families have two cows
It could be obtained on the ground which is in the hands of the estate
There is no moorland attached to the home farm
There is no milk produced on the home farm for sale so far as I am aware
Not that I am aware of
The Goathill farm is in the hands of another tenant
That farm still sends milk into the town
I cannot tell
A considerable number
Yes
I appear here as a delegate of the ratepayers and inhabitants of Stornoway for the purpose of bringing before you the great necessity of extending the telegraphic system to the islands of the Hebrides which is so much required for the proper conducting and development of the fisheries
I need not point out that the fish trade of the kingdom is the largest contributor to the telegraph revenue and that being so it proves of itself how much it is required for the conduct of the fisheries  and if I can bring before your notice places in the Hebrides which are yet without its advantages I think you will see at once the great necessity of an extension to these parts
The fisheries of the Hebrides comprise the herring fisherya very important fishery the quality of which is supsrior to any in the kingdom except the small fishery at Loch Fyne
There is also the cod and ling fishery a very important fishery of itself but for the want of telegraph and other facilities for the market it is confiued to the salting instead of the fresh trade
This is a very important trade in its present state but it cannot be utilised or taken advantage of
Then again we have the haddock fishery a fishery which I am informed could be carried on with considerable advantage in this island  but for want of transit and of the telegraph system it cannot be utilised or carried on
Again we have the salmon lobster and oyster fisheries all of which I am informed by competent persons could be carried out to a great extent if they were only fostered as they should be and as they are in other parts of the kingdom and in other countries
I produce a financial statement of the herring fisheries for the last ten years in the Stornoway section and Barra section and also a statement of the cod and ling fisheries for the last ten years
What I propose is that starting the night mail from London at nine oclock it would arrive at Strome Ferry at halfpast three adding to the acceleration which is promised  and instead of the mail passing to Ullapool the steamer should cross direct to Strome Ferry and leave immediately with the mails and light goods
Giving it six hours to arrive here we would have the mail at ten or eleven oclock at night ready to be delivered next morning instead of getting the letters at six or seven oclock at night when business hours are over
Acceleration
I gather that from the evidence given by Mr Dougal
Nothing
Yes
I am not aware it was done but there was a public meeting last week at which resolutions were carried and ordered to be forwarded
I do not see why it should not suit us if they would not detain the steamer by working goods too much
My opinion is that one boat would be sufficient to carry the mails and goods and to convey fresh fish from here
I believe it would take a much less rate than at present
I do
No they do not catch much because they cannot get them despatched in time
I believe they do
Yes quite safely
With small lines
I believe there are
I believe there is oyster fishing in Loch Roag though not properly cultivated
So far as my inquiries have gone if carried out on the principle of farming it would be a very important fishery and I believe the oysters there are of a very improved quality
I do not know which part my information is rather general
That is rather a puzzling question
In Norway where the best men have been engaged upon it they have not yet been able to arrive at the habits of the fish and their habits are so peculiar that it is a very difficult matter to give an opinion
Generally speaking it has
No I am not prepared to give an opinion though I have studied the question
Coupled with the acceleration of the railway the prices would be increased  per cent
We could send the fish in fresh
Yes
I have been about eleven years in the island and have visited most of the islands and there were three things that pained me exceedingly
One thing was to see places large farms that were previously occupied by crofters and where no crofter was to be seen when I passed through these places
One of them was Galston
I was very much pained when I saw Galston under sheep knowing that crofters had been there
The second thing was the poverty of the people and especially the want of comfort in their homes
I have been called upon frequently to engage in prayer and in doing so I had to kneel and I have often had to kneel I might almost say in the mudno floor to the houses and some of them exceedingly wetalmost floods of mud
The third thing that has pained me is thisthat our young men in the country places who have no lots as I understand are prevented from marrying
Now I have always been in favour of young men getting married and I think any country which is to prosper must give a young man the privilege of falling in love when he sees a worthy young woman and marrying her if she is willing to accept his offer
After hearing the grievances which have been stated I have been thinking that there are remedies for the island
And the first remedy I would mention is thisto have the whole island divided for the people of the island be they crofters or farmers
I was just thinking how that could be done
I find in round numbers there are  acres in the island
These  acres divided into lots of  acres each would give a lot of  acres to each crofter among  or  crofters to have  acres each
Allowing that these  acres to each crofter would be given for s an acre then the rental of the island would be  a year
If these lots were rented at s d per acre the rental of the island would be  In the one case allowing s an acre for the lot of  acres the rental would be  more than the present rental or allowing s d per acre the rental of the island would be  more than the present rental
Then I have looked at the amount that was paid for the estate by Sir James and I have been told that he paid about  for it
Suppose he paid  for the island then if my calculations are correct I hold that two years rental at s per acre supposing the island to be divided into  acre lots would be as much as the whole amount that was paid for the estate or taking s d per acre the rental of the island would in four years amount to  or a little more than was paid for the estate
It may be asked how could the land be divided among the people so that each crofter should have  acres
I would suggest that every man above eighteen years old should be allowed to take a croft if he wished and not only that but every woman above eighteen should also have the same privilege so that a young man and a young maiden if they wished might take up crofts beside each other before they were married and get married and join the two crofts into one
That was suggested to me for instance in other lands such as Canada
In Manitoba the Government gives a croft of  acres and every man above eighteen and every young woman who likes can take a croft so that a young man and young woman who like to get these lots can go and take them and get married and join their lots
I may be asked what would be done with the large farmers
Well I would suggest that the best thing would be if they did not like to have their farms broken up to emigrate to Canada and there they would get farms as large as they wished and I am confident they would be better off than they would be in this island
It may be asked if the whole island is divided into small crofts how can the crofters cultivate these lots especially when some of these would be inland and moorland
I hold from my knowledge of farmingand I have been about thirtynine years in Canada and know a good deal of farming that a crofter having  acres even inland on the moor could cultivate these  acres with his family so that he could have sufficient cows sheep and even a horse if not two horses and manure the  acres for himself independent of the sea
I am aware that the black land that covers a great deal of the island is difficult of removal but there is a way of removing it
When many of the farmers entered Canada at first they had to take possession of grounds that were covered with wood and they cleared those woods took out the stumps and removed the stones and made firstclass farms of those lands
Now I cannot see why a crofter should not take possession of  acres and if need be cut up the peat and burn itdry it make piles of it burn it and scatter the ashes on the ground leaving half a foot or a foot of the black soil over the gravel so as to mix it with the gravel
Another idea presents itself
It may be said it would be exceedingly difficult for poor crofters to work these small lots of  or  acresthat they could not do it without assistance from Government or some other party but I believe they could
I believe that the men in this island if they had the land for themselves could work these small lots so as to bring them into a good state of cultivation and be in a measure somewhat comfortable on these lots
Still while holding these views and thinking the island might be divided I would not wish the Commissioners to understand that I believe the crofters would be then in clover
I dont believe that
I dont believe that this island is so rich in its soil that even when the land was subdivided it would support the people so that they would be in clover
Hence I have a second remedy to propose and that is voluntary emigration
At present the Government of Canada offers  acres free to every man or woman who wishes to settle in the country and along with that the Government will sell  acres at two dollars an acre making in all  Parties might be informed of the advantages in connection with Canada so that they might emigrate and take up lands there and have them for their own
I have been in Manitoba
I went nearly f miles west of Winnipeg and saw firstclass farmers from the provinces of Ontario and Quebec who took lands there for themselves and their sons and I found out from them that the northwest was a remarkably good country not only for pioneers but even for old settlers
For instance an Irishman about three years ago bought  acres at some distance from the city of Brandon
He paid parties to plough  acres the first year and after sowing those  acres and paying all expenses in connection with the working of the farm he had  bushels of oats besides wheat and other crops
The first crop was such that after paying all expenses he had  per cent of profit
I think parties wishing to emigrate should be assisted by Government or in some other way to take advantage of those benefits
Of course for the other crofters I mentionedyoung men who are not able to get marriedthat would be the remedy if they had land for themselves or if they went to another country where they could have land
Yes
I may say that when I heard a statement made the other day that they were poorer than the crofters of this island I at once said to myself that the gentleman who made the statement must have been misinformed
I am confident from my personal knowledge of the countryand I have travelled over a great part of Canada that the crofters there even the poorest unless they are lazy men and persons who do not take care of themselves are in comfortable circumstances and from what I know even if Lady Matheson offered to these people lots from the best of her land in the island and to have their passages paid my firm conviction is that they would not accept such an offer
If any one says in regard to Canada that parties who went there and got lands are not in more comfortable circumstances than those in this island he was misinformed or did not know much or did not keep his eyes open
Perhaps he was in a sleeping car when he passed through the country
I did not hear of any
Oh no but I hold that a young man should have room to make provision for himself and his wife
His country is not worth fighting for unless he can have room to make provision for himself and his wife
Yes
I believe they find it heavier than they would find s d or s if they had  acres
But the common hill is not good pasturage
A few acres of good grass would be far better than a number of acres on the moor
Yes I have been considering it for years and I know something about the clearing of bush land in Canada
I have cleared more than one acre when I was young and I would undertake to clear off an acre of the land hereto clear away the peatmuch easier than I could clear an acre of bush land in some lots in Canada
I think there is
A good deal perhaps is gravel
Yes I think a mistake is made when most of the peat is taken away
It would be better to leave half a foot or a foot to mix with the gravel
Yes
I may state in connection with this that I am aware there was an experiment on the island to try and bring in some of the moorland and it did not turn out very well
I believe that arose from thisthat the crofters were not placed on that land so as to manure it wellbut if there was a large piece of land given to the crofters the result would be different
Yes
Yes
I think there are some places where it is seven eight or nine feet in depth
Yes
No but I am not in favour of trenching
I was not aware of that
I think not
A crofter who has a family could cut the peat make small heaps of it after drying it and set fire to it
He would not remove it to any distance but Greenfield simply make small heaps of it and burn it
But I would plough it
I mean after the peat is burned I would then employ horses to plough up the soil and mix the black ground with the gravel
He could do it for less than that
I understood this year that when some crofters got jobs near their places they worked with their families and were able to do in a day or two what several men could not do in a number of days and I know farther what I have seen in Canada that when families went in together they could do things much cheaper and improve their farms without money
Yes
Yes
The land would pay itself
Because the arable land they have is so small
I am not aware they can
But the moorland is not divided
What I propose is that the whole land should be ascertained and divided into small lots and marked and parties would have these lots to themselves and fence them and work them
When I was in Canada about fourteen dollars or a little over    would clear an acre
Well I was not looking so much to the amount paid for the clearing of the acre as to the labour of the family
No the land can only be harrowed because the stumps are numerous and they sow the land between the stumps and harrow it and it is only after some years that they get the stumps removed
Yes
I think so if they had ploughs for the purpose
They have adopted a plan on the prairies where they only turn two inches at the first
It may be easier but they only turn two inches at first and I think two inches of gravel could be turned
I would say at once that emigration was the best
If I were about to commence farming and if Lady Matheson offered me  acres of her best arable land I would prefer to take  acres of prairie land in Canada
I think there is
I understood there were about  crofters at present on the island
Divide the land among the  and it would give them about  acres each
Not without giving them the whole island
But I hold the moorland is of very little advantage to crofters in comparison with what arable land would be
Some only send their cattle a few months during the year to these moorlands
But they only have it in this way
Some have three acres of arable land and several acres of moorland but these acres of moorland are not worth much
They only support a few cattle and they are not very good
Yes I think so
Yes but when I make that statement I remember that the people of this country are fond of their own land and their old associations and might be unwilling to emigrate but I am under the impression that if the advantages in connection with Canada were laid before them and free passages given to them there are a good many who would emigrate
Yes I think so
I am appointed by several crofters
I may mention it was the wish of the general body of the crofters that I shoidd appear and I was also appointed by parties who were understood to represent the croftersI refer to the Highland Lewis Land
Association who were acting as a committee in public to prepare the parties for the reception of the Commissioners
I produce a specimen of the mandates I have
I believe it has not this particular paper perhaps but the draft of it
I may just state in connection with it to show the unreliability of the public here within a few minutes it was conveyed to Mr Munro by one of the officials and I am threatened with an action of damages  and I am here to defy any action of damages
Mr Walter Rose
It was the people of the place who put down what was put into that paper by Mr Rose
Yes
Fourteen at present pay rent
Upwards of  I came there fortythree years ago and there were eight lots then
It is thirtythree years at least since most of it was taken from us
About the same time
I was at sea at the time
All at the same time
No
Yes
No
A long time ago
I cannot mention the date
I was at sea at the time
Eight acres of the thirty were given to Mr Mackenzie in Lady Hoods time and the rest in Sir James time
Our burying place is at Uy
The complaint is not that the chuchyard is surrounded by a six feet wall without a gate but that there is a six feet wall near our own house on the roadthe only road we can conveniently go to the churchyard
Yes
Yes that was the regular burying place
It affects only our township
The others can go by another way
There was a gate but in order to prevent the possible access of a beast through that gate into the parks the gate was broken down and the entrance closed up
I did not like to trouble the factor but the ground officer was spoken to this year about it
I do not know what he said
It was somebody else who spoke to him and not myself
The conversation occurred at a funeral at which the ground officer was present
When I came to Steinish fortythree years ago I was paying  s of rent
I had four milk cows then
It is thirtythree years since the pasture I have mentioned was taken from us and now I can scarcely maintain one cow
Two cows are the most that any crofter in the place keeps and it is as much as they can do to keep them
What the people want is more grass for their cattle and the arable land which they lost
They require kitchen with their food as well as the food itselfmilk and butter and clothing to clothe themselves
We would be very well contented with it
I know it is too high
I pay  s d besides taxes
If it was at the same rent at which we had it before we  would be content that is  s with the pasture land restored
It is not bad land at all we are not complaining of the land
It is easy enough if they liked to give it to us
I cannot answer that
The boundaries that are now between us and the tack were made at the time when the tack was erected
The dyke was made close to our doors when that land was taken from us
A boy standing at any of the doors in our township in the centre could easily throw a stone to the boundary on the one side and to that on the other
Yes
Goramclete
The other tack is Mr Simon Frasers and it has no other name than that of Steinish
These dykes were erected entirely for the benefit of the tacks on each side
We were deprived of our peat moss at the same time
It is not destroyed it is as good as ever
There is a part of the ground on that sidethe tacksmans sidewhere there never was a road  but beyond that the road is as it was
The oldest churchyard in Lewis
It is called Aignish
I believe it is
Because we were very peaceable and preferred to bear it rather than put other people to trouble
I appear on behalf of Bay Head and on behalf of the Stornoway branch of the Highland Lewis Land Reform Association
The principal grievance which the Lewis people have got in general with the whole of the West Highland crofters is that any one buying an estate buys them and has got the power of turning them out of their native soil without compensation or anything else but sending them off
When a man buys the Lewis land and  people he buys the rights and liberties of the people with the right of turning them out and it is the wish of these poor men that the right of eviction should be stopped entirely so long as they pay rents
The principal grievance also is that there are lots of land in Lewis to support from  to  people and instead of that land being given to the crofters it is wholly under deer and sheep farms and let
These crofters are willing to pay a fair rent for that land if they only got it and there is plenty of it for them
If any crofter is put into a bit of bog land and reclaims that land with the sweat of his brow for thirty years as the law exists at present he does not get a cent for compensation for improvements no matter how it goes so far as I am led to understand
The Lewis people are overcrowded and put down to the worst pieces of land down to the seashore and the best land in the island is under deer and sheep farms
They wished Lady Matheson to give this land at a fair rent and subdivide it out to the tenants for they were willing to pay but they were refused  and I understand they did not get it and what they wish is that they humbly pray Her Majestys Government that they would compel the proprietors to give them the land at a fair rent
There is no part of the west coast like the Lewis
They are the finest race of men we have got to recruit the army and the navy
The people are loyal subjects and willing to fight for Her Majesty the Queen and their country and it would be a pity to exterminate them all from their native soil for the sake of deer and sheep
I may further say they are not Revolutionists Communists or Socialists
They only want what is fair and just and what they are willing to pay for
They are loyal subjects
There is a spirit of discontent all along the West Highlands at present and unless the Government step in and make some concessions to the people by way of giving them the lands for which they are willing to pay and fixity of tenure they may be led to break the law and a spirit of discontent may get up that no Government could put a stop to So it is the wish of the people that their grievances should be remedied in order to put a stop to the system of oppression and slavery under which they are labouring at present
I am certain that the people are more frightened of the proprietor and factor than they are of the God that created them
Those people and their forefathers occupied the sod for hundreds of years and they consider it a case of hardship to be under the sway of any man who has it his power to exterminate them out of the land of their birth
In some districts of the Lewis they have been compelled to leave and emigrate to foreign shores against their will
They have been forced to leave parts of Uig against their will and they have been forced to leave Ness and Galston over at the Butt of Lewis and they have been forced to leave other districts
In some districts they were and in other districts they were put out to take bog land and to commence reclaiming it again
Some years ago  I am not exactly sure
I am not exactly sure as to twenty years but I know it is within the last twenty or thirty years
The  inhabitants of the island are principally people at the bidding and beck of one single individual and it is to take the power from them by a proper measure being passed by Parliament that it is the only hope and cure for a present state of matters
I have no idea what they are
I cannot say
We would have a clause in the Bill for that matter of it that every man who had three or four or five years rent to pay should be evicted
People dont want the land for nothing
Certainly I do
Provided there were three or four or five years rent against them
As to that I cannot answer
No
Well it is a grievance of the people
It is the peoples grievances we are talking about it is not a matter of pounds shillings and pence
No
The Lewis I am certain would be sold
If the parties who are acting for the trustees or whoever they are that the island belongs to at present sold it I am sure the whole crofters would go in for it and buy it right off if they got it at a moderate price
It would only cost about  s a head and give  more than was paid for it
I was not aware of it
They are paid up here so far as I know
What the people want is that they wish the Government to pass a law to put a stop for ever to eviction and have fixity of tenure and the land at a fair rent
That was admitted before that in the case of any crofter being three four or five years in arrears of rent be should be evictedbecause they do not want the land for nothing
They want the land at a fair rent
Certainly to give them a chance
I said that in the event of four or five years rent being against them Government or the law would permit them to be evicted then but not under four or five years because they might have a few bad years and might get into difficulties but might pull up and pay it afterwards
Yes
Yes or compel the parties to sell their estates to the people the one or the other
I am sure it would
I am sure if the people got the land and if they were certain that they would not be turned out instead of the Lewis supporting  people in misery and poverty as they exist at present it would be able to support  or  people in plenty and quite contented
Yes
They are not Communists or Socialists they want to pay for what they get
Yes
I have gone through every part of the island and I know the best parts are under sheep and deer and the worst patches are occupied by the crofters down at the seashore
I dont see that the crofters could interfere much
They dont want to do away with the Game Laws in that way
If all the large sheep runs and other farms and islands that are laid waste at present were given to the people
I say and maintain here the rental would be quite as high as at present
They produce mutton do they not
Most of the land that is under sheep runs in the Lewis was at one time cultivated with the sweat of the brow and with the daily toil of the poor crofters who had to work for the land and never got compensation for improvements and after it was taken into a state of  cultivation they were driven out and sheep and deer put in their stead
Because it is waste
The country is getting wild and the grass itself does not grow right and the heather is coming to grow again
The finest portion of the land is over at Uig and is laid waste and over at Park and several other large tracts of the country that are under sheep and deer and the people down on the seashore
A considerable proportion
I cannot give you a proper answer to that
The crofters want the arable land and the moorland besides for their cattle and sheep for which they are willing to pay
I would consider six to ten acres of arable land and the moorland in connection with the crofts
No I did not
I do not know the acreage
I have been calculating so many people
I have been thinking a great number could be put upon the sheep runs that are under one man
There are vast districts in our island that are not occupied by the people at all and in former years they used to have their crofts there but now all these districts are under sheep and deer
Instead of supporting  it would support  or 
I know the districts
I do not know at the present time
At present the people are ignorant and the majority of them cannot even talk the English language and the system that would be suitable for them at present would not be required in a few years because when their children are educated and have a knowledge of the world they would not condescend to wait upon their present crofts
But our people at present are not in a position to pick themselves up in the Colonies
They are not educated they have not got the English language and in every way they would be an unsuitable lot to send away to the Colonies
I say no that they will be far better under present circumstances when they have the sea to fall back upon as well as the land and that they never would be as comfortable in any part of the land as they would be in the Lewis
I am aware that a considerable number of those who were evicted and exterminated out of the land of their birth were in a worse plight in the country of their adoption than they were in their old country
From various letters and information which have come
Yes
No
So far as I know they were compelled to go
Why in the Lewis if the people are deprived of their land they must go somewhere
It is as well for them to leave the country altogether
They were deprived of their lands against their will
They were willing and able to pay and they are so still
I am certain of it
I am not certain of the whole of them but I know the majority were the same as at present
And there was no reduction made of the rent this season when the crops were an entire failure and every proprietor along the coast gave a reduction our proprietor gave no reduction at all
No
About  or  I believe
I know he did
To a considerable extent
I know the whole crofter and fishing population would buy the island if they got it at a fair price and  or  more than he paid for it
Through coming in contact with the people all over the island
I dopoverty and misery
The people would build better houses and reclaim the land and have everything in order if they had fixity of tenure
I say that taking them as class altogether they are in a state of misery and poverty
Yes I am aware that the evil is widespread all over the Western Islands
Yes I do
I was elected by the free will of a number of the Stornoway people
There was a considerable number present
There was a meeting here last week
Yes I did
So far as I could see it was
According to my calculation I fancy there would be about  people present
Yes
Yes and I have been out of it for a good bit too sometimesfor six or twelve months
I have been about Scotland and over England
No
Certainly
Yes we have both of these systems here
It always tells against the person who is removed
Under the new system of fair rent
Yes rather than remain under the present state of existence in which they are
A considerable portion of the Lewis islands are laid waste in that way
I am aware they combined that they fished at sea and worked on land besides
To a certain extent they might have done so
Yes they have been driven out of the best portions of the Lewis and driven down to the most barren placesthe same as they were driven out of Park and put in upon Crossbost a place which they reclaimed with the sweat of their brows and nothing at all for their labour
Yes it is
Very little indeed
Certainly
He never expended any money upon crofters
Money was spent in works which were a failure I understand
The crofters derived no benefit from it
They only were paid d to s d a day and no labourer would work for s d a day
That was about the wage they got when the improvements were going on
There was nothing done for the benefit of the crofters as far as my knowledge goes all over the island
I mean their lands were not improved and they got no houses and there were no improvements done of any kind that I know of  and I know of districts in the Lewis where there are no roads at all and where these people are paying road money for the last thirty years and where there has never been a road at all
Yes I am
I am aware that the people have no confidence themselves in building houses or laying out money because they may be turned out of those lands at any time and they have not got security or fixity of tenure
I was not aware of that
Those articles might have been in existence  it is well to have it on paper but it is a different thing to have it in facts
I do
It has a very demoralising effect upon the people
Yes
Well known
Yes that was a very common occurrence
They are in debt to the merchants
It is the merchants who support them and they are the ruination of the mercantile community through taking meal and everything they want on credit and they are not able to pay because if they had the land they would be in a firstrate position and without it they are in poverty
Yes it would revive trade in the town and would be the best thing for business
If the people got the land back with the thriving population it would benefit the country the wholesale trade as well as the retail
No I derive no benefit by this agitation  I am not paid for it
Certainly
Yes all over the island
Yes the people of Stornoway at the time Sir James Matheson bought the island had grass round the town whereas they have not got it now and the majority of the tradesmen and working men had an acre or two of land and a head or two of cattle whereas now they have got nothing at all and there is now a spirit of discontent all over
That is my opinion
Yes
It is not a matter of rent so much
They would allow the same price for the island as Sir James paid for it and it would be only  s a head
About 
I say that instead of the island supporting  people in misery it would support  or  in a contented way
Yes I am endeavouring to do so
I say there is in my opinion about three times more land under deer forests and under sheep than the crofters possess
Considering the moorland pasture they have
It is my opinion that the crofting townships pays a higher rent or quite as high as any tack that would be held by any tacksman or shepherd
I do not say deer forest
The land is there and men are there to show it to you and the whole district is waste
I expect they do
It is my opinion they do
They pay an exorbitant rent
I cannot answer that question without knowing what the size of the croft would be
Give them moorland in common if the whole township used the moorland in common
I cannot answer
The half of it any how
 do not say the half is capable of easy cultivation but I maintain there is a considerable proportion of the soil that could be cultivated and a considerable amount of moorland is under sheep and deer which is fitted for a crofter population
No I am not
Yes they want to get their lands back that their forefathers were deprived of and I do not suppose they would have any objection to pay a fair rent
I never heard of  people being in the Lewis but I know that if the people got the land the Lewis would be able to support  people contentedly and in a good way and that the place would be a splendid recruiting ground for the army and navy and that it would produce a race of men without their equal in the whole United Kingdom
I maintain that when the people do get educated they will not remain in the place at all
That is my opinionthat they will not remain
No but any overplus or overcrowding the balance which the island would not be fit to maintainwould emigrate of their own free will and accord when they get educated and when they know what the world is doing
But at present there is no use of the people emigrating because they cannot even talk the English language and they are not educated and have not been brought up to hard labour
Those whom they left behind in my opinion and so far as I know are far more comfortable than the majority of those that emigrated I do not mean educated men from the town
I maintain on authority that they are worse off than those they left behind
Yes
Yes they are
I mean that parties working for ten or fifteen years reclaiming bog when they get nothing for their labour are suffering what I call penal servitude
He may have had a private arrangement
He might be fool enough to do it but there were others who built houses and were kicked out and got no compensation at all
Yes
I did say valuable houses I said houses
I have got the name to give but I will not give the name without asking his consent in case summary vengeance might bo taken upon him otherwise
The principal grievance is that the lands they had were taken from them and they want them back again
In common with the workmen of the town they would like very much to get back the lands from which they were driven and which they are willing to pay for
All round the town
I said from six to ten acres of arable land with moorland in connection with it and in common
From six to ten acres is the average of crofters land of good quality
They use the hill pasture in common
It would depend upon the nature and quality of it because in some districts the hill pasture is better than in other districts
The proper way to get at it is to give them the hill pasture and the land and they can arrange those matter themselves
I should fancy from six to ten head of cattle and from forty to fifty head of sheep
Not necessarily it might require one horse
Yes that is what I consider
Yes undoubtedly
Yes
Yes that is what I mean
Yes I would make it compulsory to have whole lots without subdivision
Yes I would
I know that the people worked at relief worksmaking roads
Yes there were roads in the island
I think there were roads all the way from here to Ness
Yes
Yes there were other ones
I am not confident about them because it was before my time
He may have done so but I am not aware of any schools
Yes there was
No I was not aware of that till now
I suppose about fifteen years ago
The only improvements he did in the Lewis that I know of were on the grounds round the castle
So far as I know and have been told the wages on the average were from d to d per daywithin the last ten or fifteen yearsin my own day
That is what I have been informed
I come in contact with a great deal of information
I am always on the move
Well I have been hearing about it all round
No I have not got it directly
Within the last forty or fifty years the working wages in this country for unskilled labour were two shillings a day
No I am not aware of that
They are willing to take the land that was under cultivation before and is now under deer and sheep
Yes
Park
It is inland a good deal too
No
He is not
I say the matter of rent is not the principal grievance it is the matter of land
They want the land altogether
Some of the crofters complain that the rents are high enough but it is not the rent question that is agitating the people at all
I think it would
No I have not
I say there would be a considerable proportion of those people who would be at the fishing industry
Perhaps half of them
I am not prepared to answer that
No
The Free Church expended large sums
I was not aware that sums were expended in the country districts by Sir James
I was not aware of that till now
Yes
This townshipBaybleis really divided into four different places for every one of which delegates were appointed
I cannot speak for the whole of them but I can speak for Upper Bayble
About sixty
The whole township was present when I was elected
In the first place I have to say we have too little land and again we are much crowded together because of the numerous populationpoor crofts and high rents
In this way we are so much reduced so far brought down that it is with the utmost difficulty that we are able to keep body and soul together people gathered from all parts of the island and thrown in upon us and new lots apportioned out at our very doors for these people so that we cannot move about freely and carry peats or any other supplies to our own housesa fence dyke round us and the only bit that we had in order to get to our peat moss was this year taken from us and given to another man so that now we are in a worse plight than ever
If we had land and I myself as head of a family endeavouring to rear my family as well as I canif I had an opportunity of getting a piece of land and all of us had we would be enabled to live more comfortably than now we can do
I take my living for my family out of the sea
What I take out of the croft would not support my family for one week this year
I was only able to make one boll of meal and I had no potatoes at allso that I have to live upon the goodwill of the Stornoway merchants and because of the unsuccessful fishing I have run so much in debt with them that now my credit is gone
They say Cape Horn is a wild place
Now this place where I live is exposed to the winds that blow down upon the one side from Cape Wrath and upon the other from the Butt of Lewistwo places that are quite as wild as Cape Horn
Our shore is so exposed from these two quarters that while we could work well enough at sea we are not able to save our lives or our boats when we reach the land
For want of a place of refuge I lost a boat that cost over  If we had a place of refuge there since we can work well we would be able to take our living out of the sea as other people in Scotland are able to do
I remember the quay having been built there and my father having paid his   for the boat as all the other people who had boats had to pay and that quay was broken down by order of some one connected with the estateI dont know who
This has rendered the place more exposed through the breaking down of the quay than it was before the quay was built at allso much so that my own son along with four of a crew were drowned by the capsizing of the boat at our own door
Our only resource then is in this way cut away from us
My son was supporting me and after his loss I am now reduced very low
The township is very large and I would beseech you to hear one other delegate who is older than I am to speak on behalf of the town
It is right opposite it
Yes it is the same landing place of the herring boats
Yes we could save our boats there and it was very handy for landing the fish and gear
About thirty
There were some came from outside  the rest are the increase of the place
Probably there were not ten families coining in but a single man would come in and marry a girl from Bayble and settle there
Not since I remember
I remember one in particular that came dext door to myself from the parish of Uig
Two bolls of barley meal and one boll of oatmeal would make an average year and about twelve barrels of potatoes
I never got as high as twenty barrels of potatoes in any one year
I have only half a lot
The widow of a neighbour who was drowned along with my own son
One cow and a stirk and one sheep
When  have to buy for my family I have also to buy food for the cow
I cannot get out of the croft what will feed that one cow
s of bare rent
Yes we had that portion at the back of the ring fence of the township where other lots were cut out for us
That increase I spoke of was partly the increase of the place and partly some coming in from the outside
You know when these lots were cut out they were given to young men and to some old people that had no lots at the time
There is a little upon our side of the township yet but the giving of that to us would only shut the others in more than they are  but there is plenty throughout the country and I would be quite ready to go to any place in the island that would be near the sea to take up a bit of land in preference to remaining where I am
I cannot tell unless it was at Sir James Mathesons with such assistance as he might get from the fishcurers and with this  that was levied upon the fishing boats
Yes I saw it with my own eyes
The practice was to go down with a steam launch and a lighter
The lighter would be left there beside the quay and stranded upon the beach and filled with stones and then when the tide came in the launch would come back and tow it to Stornoway
Over twelve years ago
I told them they were doing a bad turn to us but I said nothing more than that
Yes  were it not for that I would not have let the stones be taken away for they were of great service to us
Yes
It would be a means of livelihood to about two hundred families from Bayble alone in addition to such other families as could make use of it from neighbouring places such as Garabost Shashader and Knock
These would make it a fishing station in the summer season
I could not give any idea as to the actual cost in money of such an undertaking but to build what we call a harbour of refuge which the boats would run into for shelter would cost very little in money
Stones are there  it is easily constructed and the people of the place all round about would be very willing to lend a hand
I myself am an old man and I would be very glad to lend a hand
We would be only too glad to do so
Yes I would not have worked both my strength and my credit in making a livelihood if I had had that in the past
Yes so far as the quay is concerned but they would also like to get assistance from the land
Those that could not work by the sea would also have to be looked after and the Government should see to it that they also should have some kind of assistance given them
Everybody that can
Statement to be laid before the Royal Commission by the delegates of the Garabost crofters
When the brickwork commenced about thirty five years ago in our neighbourhood the best part of our hill pasture was taken from us and attached to it
This was made into parks enclosed by turf dykes
These dykes we had to keep in repair till about two years ago without receiving any wages for our labour
Paraffin oil manufacture was also for some time carried on in connection with this brickwork and a stranger who came to superintend it got part of our pasture also and our peat bunks were taken from us for the use of these works and we had to cut them at a much greater distance from our houses and sometimes the peats we cut in the latter place were carried away without our consent and without payment
One man who cut some in the old place after we were told to give it up had to pay a fine of    and his rent was raised s and he still pays this increase of rent which was imposed upwards of twenty years ago
If our cattle or horses entered the parks even in winter we had to pay pound money for them
The children who attended the cattle were often ill used
The new part of our township was once common pasture and we got no reduction of rent when deprived of it but instead of this we had to pay d once paid as road money for the almost useless park which remained
The road money is now paid by a tax of sixpence per pound of rental
The rent of the whole township now including that of the parks and of the new part of the township is nearly double of what it was forty years ago
Although the loss of life and property from want of proper harbour accommodation has been considerable we got no help or encouragement from the estate for making a harbour  and a quay which was made at Bayble by the stranger with the help of the fishermen who contributed   per crew was destroyed the stones having been removed for making improvements connected with the estate
Supposing a man on the day of collecting the rents from some unavoidable cause failed to answer his name when called no explanation whatever would exempt him from paying a fine of s
This applies only to the time of our present factors predecessor
If any one dared to seek redress of these grievances the uniform result was a threat to deprive him of his lands
When Kenneth MLeod one of the delegates built a house on his fathers croft twentyfive years ago a fine of   was imposed and on succeeding another crofter some time later he had to pay   of arrears which were due by his predecessor
The remedies we would propose are
Sixtynine
Over  so far as I can make out
Our being deprived of outpasture was a rise of rent because it was upon this pasture we were able to feed our stock
Sir James Matheson the proprietor
Yes
There was no abatement on the contrary this additional s was placed upon us
The brickworks are fenced round and there are four parks surrounding the brickwork and these are rented out and we got no reduction
Yes
Yes we were keeping up that dyke
We were so much afraid of the estate people that we were afraid if we did not do what they liked in keeping up the dyke we should be deprived of the small holding we had
Yes
Not a penny
They were very injurious to us
We could not get to the well without going over these dykes and besides the people on the other side would not allow us to take the water
Yes some of us would be working in it but there were regular workers at the brickwork and they were keeping these enclosures as their own pasture ground
Yes
We had to go a good bit to get any peat bank
Yes
Yes
Twenty years ago
Old Munro
We are tired of that administration anyhow
Yes
Three
Including taxes it is    s
Some of them only keep two cows some one
We are deprived of pasture land and cannot keep stock
The three would not make one good cow
Yes the young people
Yes
Yes
It is in Bayble that we used to keep our boats
Yes there is no doubt of that
Many can testify as to that
There was a steamer carrying away the stones from that quay all the way to Stornoway
Yes
We were so much depressed by the hard times we had and the administration we were underwe were so thoroughly accustomed to the word you will be deprived of your land
We cannot telL
No we never did
Yes it was the quay where the boats used to throw out their herring
Many a score of crans of herring did I myself put ashore there
It was Mr Methven that built the quay but in order to recoup himself for his expense he levied  upon every boat that was in Bayble for onceand that was an excellent bargain for them
The stones were not entirely taken away  the quay was rendered perfectly useless for when once the sea was able to make a breach in on it by the stones being removed it was of no further use see Appendix A
XL
Yes
I paid   of a fine
When I built the house there was only my father and mother and one brother and a little sister
After building the house
I offered the factor to pull it down again if he would not impose this fine upon me but he told me that supposing I should pull it down I should have to pay a fine of the difference being only   
I considered it would be a very poor house indeed that was not worth that
I had a third portion of the croft and I was paying the rent along with my father ever since I was seventeen years of age and helping the family
Yes
I cannot tell exactly what the first house cost me but I have an idea what my present house cost

It is a slated house
Probably it was at the time against the regulations of the estate but then I offered to pull the house down and that would not relieve me of my fine they were so keen for it
Donald Munro
No
It has certainly had to do with the character of the buildings on the estates the little encouragement we got in these matters and the use of that phrase I stated beforeof casting up to them that they would be deprived of their land
To provide a comfortable dwelling for myself and my family
No
No I believe that the want of such assurance prevents men from improving their dwellings in this place
Yes
No
The man who was in arrears was no relation of mine
An uncle of mine assumed this croft as joint tenant with him and both fell into arrears and then I had to pay his  of arrears before I got possession
The man fell in arrears but there were no arrears against my uncle
I had some spirit to undertake the matter but for many a long day I was looking upon it as a foolish proceeding
Yes Ihavewhen we were deprived of that back pasture land and the other matters I have mentioned
Not altogether
Some of it was done before I built my house
Things were not so high then as they have been since I built the house
That is not the case
The stones were removed first and it was the breach caused by the removal of these stones that gave the sea the advantage over it
Of one thing I am certain that   was laid upon every one to meet the expense of the quay and that was paid to Mr Methven fishcurer
We as Highlanders and Islesmen dont distrust and dislike one another at all although we are so much crowded in upon each other
Our grievance is that we were deprived of the lands and that these have been given away to tacksmen deer and sheep
There was a dyke fence that was built between Aignish and our township and we paid for the building of that dykethe half of itthe tacksman paid the other half
Now his sheep come to us when our own cattle are on the moorland pasture and when any of ours will go to him whether sheep or cattle or horses he charges money for them
We cannot charge him in return  we are so depressed that the fear of the estate management and the like of that has taken the courage out of us
Yes
Forty or fifty at least
Fortyfour or thereabouts
There were a few from other places
There were scarcely any people but the people of the place
I have to say in the first place on their behalf that to begin with a portion of the arable land of the township was taken away from them to provide a site for a manse and a glebe for the Established Church
Then a piece of macher land that we had was taken from them and added to the tack of Aignish that is a green sward over a patch of sand
Then the moorland pasture which our fathers had we were deprived of so that if we now will send a cow for a few weeks to that moorland pasture we must pay s a head for the period and d for sheep for the same pasture ground for a settled period
Then the people in the township are very much crowded together and the ground outside our township is given to other crofters
While they weie deprived of this pasture land there was no abatement in the rent so that in the present circumstances of the township of Knock I can see no way by which the people can live
There is another specific thing connected with the fishing that is one of the causes of the poverty of the people
It affects more or less the whole population but especially our township
During the last twenty years five boats were lost in our township for want of a place of refuge
The five boats belonged to the same crew
They were lost in the gale of October last
Seven of tho boats belonging to Knock were utterly destroyed upon the st of October last for want of a place of refuge
Things have come to such a pass by our being deprived of our pasture and for want of places of refuge that if in these respects we are not relieved this island of Lewis so far as I can see will come in a short time to be a burden upon the rest of the nation
I can see no remedy for improving the condition of the people unless Parliament will see fit to deal justice to the people by giving them additional land and providing harbours of refuge to enable them to save their property on the sea
I believe the people should get the waste land that is locked up from them through the whole island at  present being under sheep and deer and of no great use to the people
I remember the tack adjoining our township having been occupied by a crofting population
I could purchase a stone of meal from them when I required it a barrel of potatoes a bushel of oats and a pint of milk
I see nothing on that farm today except green grass rushes and white sheep and they even attempt to prevent us from approaching the fishing port which our fishers used and which is one of two used by us one of them being upon this farm
I cannot tell
I am not quite certain
About five acres
I am not aware he got any pasturage
Probably about ten or twelve acres
The summer moorlands grazing
It was of great use to the people
It is now what we call a forest and there are deer upon it  but we are allowed to send our cattle there and we pay that amount to the proprietor for the privilege
So far as I know it is in the hands of the proprietor
We have no distinctive name for it
No it lies west from here about three or four miles out upon the road leading to Garanahine
There were at first four placed upon one end of our township
One came from an adjacent township called Swardale and three came from among ourselves
There have been six placed on the other end
They all belonged to the place
Yes it came to that
It was a Mr Alexander that occupied it and the farm was Aignish
Yes
Yes
I think it is of less use to both the neighbouring people and the country at large
At some portions of the year it might and others not
The distance is about fifteen miles by land and seven or eight miles by sea
It is at Gress that we fish herring just now
We go there every Monday and come home on the Saturday
Herring are not found beside us now as they used to be
The rent is higher today
I am quite convinced of that
Nothing whatever
I would like to speak about the school
We have great reason to complain of the excessive school rate and the little advantage which the young children enjoy in return for the burden that is laid upon us
I would be exceedingly pleased to know that some change would be made in the administration of education that would improve the education of the children even supposing the burden should remain
There is one thing which I personally refer to as a burden because I had a large number of children of school age
It is this that at the time of summer when it was easier for the children badly clothed and sometimes badly fed as they were to attend school regularly and when it was easier for us to send them there the school was vacant I think it would be altogether for the circumstances of such places as ourswhere we have bad roads and illfed and poorly clad weak children that the vacation should come in winter instead of in summer
Another thing in connection with the progress that the children are able to make under the present mode of education is this that I consider the Act is an Act that has really come in order to deprive us people of the Highlands of any school worthy of the name
It is just about a quarter of a mile
How can you expect our children to attend regularly in winter with bad roads in frost and snow
No
I know that the great majority are dissatisfied
They have not the chance
Yes but I know that the great majority of the crofters in my parish dont pay 
Yes that is the case
I cannot tell what the mind of the other people is upon the subject
I am not aware that the people of our township have brought it under their notice until now
s d upon the  s rent
Three
One shilling a quarter for each
I dont see much improvement in them
Yes in so far as they have yet gone
I am not a great English scholar in any way but I can test their education so far as it has gone
There are twentyfour families paying rent and there are about three who dont pay rent
I represent both
There were considerably more than the half present
Yes
It was prepared after I was elected
No
From fifteen to twenty years ago
Yes
The township in the parish next to us called Holm was cleared and the people thrown in upon us
Yes
I have it yet
I lost nothing of my croft strictly so called but these people were thrown in upon us at the upper portion of our township and the new lots were lotted out to them there so that our hill pasture was reduced in that way
A little of the land was improved for them by the proprietor
Yes much more
I could not tell but I believe each pays about   today
Yes for additional pasture land they got
I believe not
No this additional  was added to the original crofts not to these others that were sent in at all
This portion of ground at the back of our crofts was taken from us and no abatement was made in consequence of that and the  additional was added on all the same
I cannot tell accurately
No there have always been people in Melbost
When Melbost people lost their land they were added to our township and they have themselves no portion of the out pasture which originally belonged to the townshipnothing except what is within the ring fence
Yes
There was no separate arrangement with regard to rent
They pay the rent they paid before when they had their own pasture land
I got fresh land
It was very rough and I took it all in myself
I trenched and drained it and I pay about s of bare rent for it
Over twenty years
Always in the township
My father and grandfather were there before me
A brother of mine
Yes some is due to the increase of the place
I could not tell at the moment
About four acres of improved land
One cow and one sheep
I also keep a horse but my rent does not allow me to keep a horse and I arrange with another man for its keep
Well the horse is grazed by a soninlaw of my own and that makes it cheaper
Yes I plough my croft with it and I hire the horse out too
I have no promise
Nothing of the kind
We are told we have no claim upon anything beyond the bounds of arable ground
Supposing we make any complaint with regard to the out hill pasture we are told that we have no cause of complaint with regard to itthat our rights are limited by arable ground
I mean the whole of the crofters in the place
More pasture ground and relief from the heavy pressure of the burdens of rent and taxation that are laid upon us
No I would not consider it too high if it had other necessaries attached to it
Yes more pasture
That piece of pasture ground at the back of our crofts which was taken from us we still pay a rent for in respect that there was no abatement made when we were deprived of it
Some of it was restored to us
We were deprived of pasture and there was no abatement of rent
It would be easier for me to pay additional rent if I had some more pasture
The old moorland pastures of the township are now attached to the tack of Upper Holm
I cannot telL
I think we will require Government assistance as previous delegates said
These additional crofts that were cut out of the back portion of their crofts and upon which some money was expended are called by a separate name
It is a distinct township now and so the statement is true that not one penny Was expended on our township
Yes the proprietor expended money in improving crofts at Holm but these dont belong to our parish
Holm is in the parish of Stornoway
They were Harris men the greater portion of them
Some belonged to the place
Yes there was a good deal
It was at the time people were removed from Harris and they came over upon the Lewis side of the march in order to provide for their families
It was the neighbourhood  of Stornoway they came to
Very much
Yes all the people have seen the leases
Yes there are some that have taken advantage to some extent of these regulations but we have no great encouragement in doing so when we have no security against removal
We had not even a lease of the place
I have not seen that any one among us has got it yet
I cannot say that we did
Mr Helme
Yes it is a good farm
Yes a good deal
Fences were set up parks were made and a good deal of it was trenched
Yes the whole of it was cultivated as far as I can make out and more
There are two pairs always
I am not aware there is more than one familythe grieves family
The rest are unmarried people who work the farm
No
Yes
They vary
The tenant has two or three other tacks so that he can change the stock
He has other two upon this estate
Galston and Upper Barvas
They were not willing to go
They were sent away against their will and the lands they had were added to the tack upon each side of them
They are not better off now than they were then
Mrs Houston
No but all the out pasture was taken from them
Yes it was of very great consequence to them
The loss of it was of great injury to them
Yes he was well off
He lacked nothing that was necessary for a mans support
Yes
Yes
My position is nothing compared with what my fathers was
I was appointed at a meeting that was held by the people of the township in the church
The people of Tolsta were not there
The people of Coll and Vacksay were there as well as the people of Back
I believe the association that is located here gave instruction that delegates should be appointed and a meeting held
I beheve these are the parties
Yes
The most of them
When the townships in which I live was originally lotted out forty lots were made and the rent was  Since that time fifteen additional lots were made out of the back portion of the township out of uncultivated land behind the ring fence
And instead of the township getting any abatement of rent because of that the rent was raised
Now there are ninetytwo families in the township
There are six or seven of these families who occupy mere bothies and have no land at all
Then there are about twelve young married couples living in the houses of their relativestheir fathers and fathersinlawwho would be glad to take land if they got it in addition to other young men who would also be glad to get married and to take lands if such were to be had
Again it is one great cause of the poverty of the people that the holdings are so small that they can only keep as much stock as they are able to feed for if we the people had plenty of land so that we could keep a sufficient amount of stock we could be ablealthough the Lord in providence has seen fit to visit us sorely this yearstill along with what we could take from the sea we have sufficient amount of Highland spirit in us as would prevent us from allowing ourselves to appear as beggars before the people of this nation
We ourselves would then be able to maintain ourselves instead of being a burden upon the charitable people of the south
It now appears that things will continue in the same state unless some remedy is found for them through the intervention of the Queen and her counsellors
In the third place this also is the cause and poverty among the people that their holdings are so small that they must crop the whole of them every year
They are thus not able to leave a portion under grass for one year as it ought to be in order that the land could attain to some strength for the land by being continually turned over every year becomes exhausted so that it requires to be forced by manure before it can give any crop at all and even then it will not yield a good crop
Again in some places it is the cause of poverty among the people that the land is in such a bad plight by being so soft and wet so that it is a risky matter to sow any seed there until it is past seed time and so it is a matter of common sense that when sowing is late reaping must be late too and so the inclement season comes before the crop is gathered in from the places where it grows
An additional cause of our poverty is the want of harbours
In the place where I live the way the fishing is being prosecuted is sufficient to make an old man of one while he is yet young for in winter we have to leave our homes for the fishing at ten oclock at night and on through all hours of the morning according as the weather will allow
We then six of a crew will have to launch a boat over a  yards of dry ground and we have to do the reverse process when we come home again
We have to put a ton of stones into her along with the sailing and fishing material
The boat is thus loaded so that if the sea runs high upon the shore it goes over our heads before we can clear off
Now if we had harbours we could work bigger boats than we have where we could have greater safety on sea and that would be less difficult to manage when we came ashore and if we had that we could go three times farther away to the fishing ground than we can now do with the boats we have
Again in the sixth place there is a thing that causes great vexation of spirit to the people and their minds are now raised so that it is difficult to pacify them until things are put upon a proper footing
This is the cause of it allthat we see the land which our fathers had brought under cultivation by the sweat of their brows put under tacksmen or as they should more properly be called desolators of the land and ourselves heaped upon one another upon small patches of the very worst portions of the land and many without any laud at all while upon the land which they possess as grass from one years end to the other my father saw fourteen oat crops raised in succession without any manure and the last crops better than the first
Now in so far as I can understand the mind of the people and especially of the younger portion of them I fear that there is danger that they may rise as the clans of old rose if they dont get a hold over the land of which they are deprived by Act of Parliamentof which they are deprived for the sake of sheep deer and grouse
If some will say it is not right that we should be seeking these things I shall not regard these as the poor mans friend for if it is unlawful for us to ask it now it was quite as unlawful for them to deprive us of it formerly
About thirty years ago
So far as I can gather from the receipts that I have seen there was s of road money
This charge for road money was afterwards made into a charge for pasture money
Then there was Is of kain
Now this has of late been added on of our rent and then separate road money came in
I cannot tell
I believe there is a good deal more than 
Yes it is the case
There is scarcely a lot that has not been subdivided and the very few that have not been subdivided have usually two families living upon them
They are the natural increase of the place
I can say for myself and I believe I can also speak for the others that there are many reasons in which from the nature of the soil of my croft which is so wet so soft that it is quite impossible to put one grain of seed into the ground until long after the period of sowing is over
I did everything I could to drain it
I made no close drains but I made open drains
Quite aware of that
Well as far as I am concerned I never found that cause interfere with our seed time but where the soil is lightwhere it is sandy soilthere might be some foundation for it
We dont by any means oppose any just and fair law that would contribute to our own advantage
There may be some who would be able to put stock upon the land but there are many others of them who on account of the poverty of their parents and other reasons have very little laid by and would require assistance
Quite
We believe they are very much depressed in spirit from the fact that they dont get land in order to get a chance of doing so
I think there are various places where it would not be very difficult to make a good anchorage but because there is a fishing station at Gress I believe that would be about as suitable as any
I can give no idea of the cost of an undertaking of that kind but I believe in this particular case it could be done cheaper than in most places
Very willing indeed
A pier I mean a slip or a breastwork whereas by a harbour I mean a place of shelter protected by a breakwater
Yes  that a boat might enter in all weathers and at all states of the tide
It would require about sixty yards or perhaps eighty
They would not require to be anchored
They could be fastened to the quay within the harbour
Sixty or eighty boats perhaps
Only during the herring fishing time
Yes  but there are plenty of the natives who come there at the same time
Seven or eight in the particular township and about thirty in the parish
Yes it would be a sufficient station for the whole parish
Now as to the remedies in order to put matters upon a proper footing
In the first place to give plenty of land to every one who asks for itthat is from six to eight acres at an average rent of s per acre according as the soil is worth
In the second place we want harbours so that we can prosecute the fishing more sucessfully
In the third place we want that there should be a fund raised or something provided by Government for providing stock and improving the land
This money we would pay interest for and would pay it back
In the fourth place we ask that under an Act of Parliament we and our children in coming generations should have a right to the soil which we occupy and compensation for any improvements that we might make upon the lands or upon the dwelling houses
Now if we get all these things we will be able to live in comfort enjoying the fruits of the land of our birth and our ancestory
Well I would endeavour to express it in Gaelic
Yes
Because I was not certain that the Gaelic phraseology would express the same thing
I knew very well what the English phrase meant but I was not sure that I could express it quite accurately in Gaelicthat my Gaelic expression would be a quite accurate rendering
I knew myself the meaning of the phraseology quite well
Perhaps it is
It was themselves that improved it
Yes
About thirteen years
I am here to represent the people of the township and to express their cause and complaint
This is the statement you have submitted to the Commission Statements by Roderick MKenzie crofter and Malcolm MLeod crofter and mason both of the township of Coll to be submitted to the Commission on behalf of the crofters of said town
Fifty years ago the township of Coll was inhabited by twentytwo crofters keeping from three to five milk cows with several young beasts all in good condition and from twelve to forty sheep
Before Sir James Matheson bought the estate four crofters were put in upon our township and when the township of Garryghuirm was cleared other four were put in upon Coll bringing the number of crofters in Coll up to thirty see Appendix A
XL
At the same time a portion of the arable land belonging to the township was taken from the people and given to the tacksmen for whom the people were put out of Garryghuirm thus reducing the arable land of the people while the inhabitants of the township are considerably increased
About thirtythree years ago the place was relotted out and made into fortyseven crofts the rent of which was  since then twenty crofters have been put in upon the township every one of them paying rent over and above the  at which the township was rented when it was relotted
So that we now stand thus  st the township is made less by taking some of our arable land and adding it to the neighbouring tack  nd putting people in upon us in addition to the natural growth of the population until now we have three families to the one we originally had  rd the rent being increased gives the privilege of increasing the stock until people and cattle are starved alike increasing taxes and every other source of poverty and misery
The boundary dyke between us and one tacksman was built by contract for which every head of family in Coll had to pay s
Still we have to keep it up as often as any part of it falls down yet if any of our sheep or cattle go over it they are pounded and paid for before we get them out
We are so much pressed by tacksmen on both sides and behind by sportsmen and their gamekeepers that we are not allowed to walk without the fear of being taken up as trespassers even upon the hill pasture for which we pay rent
There are twentyeight crofters in the township of Coll having only one starved cow each when the tack on the one hand of us would keep one hundred families in comfort and the one on the other side eighty
Further we beg to state to the Commission that in one case we know of an old man who fell into arrears of rent and could not pay a young man who was willing to take land would not get the old mans lot until he got security that he would pay the old mans debt for which he paid  which he only managed by selling the two cows he had
In Coll just now there are ten married men and twentysix single men who would take land tomorrow if they got the chance
Suggested remedies for the foregoing grievances st Increased holdings with sufficient moorland and hill pasture to enable us to rear stock to pay our rent  nd Revaluation of land by competent parties who know the locality and security of tenure so long as the rent is paid  rd Compensation for unexhausted improvements th That tenants have a full and free access to all moorlands and hill pasture connected with their township and have a right to pluck heather and cut rushes for thatching houses or any purpose of that nature without the fear of gamekeeper or ground officer
Yes
As I first remember fifty years ago there were two lots in the town
Fortythree years ago
Ten families were put in upon us about fortythree years ago from the outside
From Garryghuirm which was cleared and another township
Out of that place four families were sent in upon us and these have now become six families
South
It is under sheep occupied by the tacksman who marches with us
Upper Coll
Perhaps about  worth and there was no abatement made in the rent
Mr Scobie was factor at that time
He only occupied that office for three years
It appears that it is Mr Munro Mackenzie that lotted the town
He succeeded Mr Scobie and it was he who fixed the rental at 
The previous rental was the same
I cannot remember
I think it was the same amount
They belonged to the place
Not since Sir James came
They cannot keep more stock
Two cows and a yearold
Four head of sheep no horse
There are four that have larger stock than I had but there are twentyeight in the place who have only one cow and a stirk perhaps as well
 s
That rent was only  s when the rents were settled by the factor upon information supplied by myself
There was an odd d that has to be added to certain of the croftsin order to make the proper subdivision of the  which was the rent of the whole township
But the factor said there would be no d that it would require to be a full shillingand this shilhng along with the shilling for hen money has made the rent  s
Fiftythree years
The same rent
Yes
Five head of cattle
We had no sheep to speak of
There is no sheep pasture
Yes at that time but not since our lots were reduced
According to the seasons
But eight bolls of barleymeal was the largest amount that ever I made in one single year sometimes four or five sometimes six and about one and a half bolls of oatmeal
Our own crofts used to tide us over the winter and sometimes longer
In a very good year we might have fifty barrels of potatoes and these would last till spring
Many years we might not have twenty barrels
I had no potatoes at all
I could scarcely say that the potatoes grew at all last season but I managed to save two bolls of barley from the storm and that was all my crop
You know that since Sir James Matheson got the property and since the potato disease things have been very hard
I would have to buy some years fourteen twelve or ten bolls of meal to support my own family in addition to the crop
I have bought already thirteen bolls of meal
I cannot tell
It must be a great deal if it can only be had
Sugar
We have neither butter nor flesh
We neither kill cow nor sheep
The greater portion of them
How can they be otherwise when their single cow does not give milk
They cannot make  lbs of butter in the year
No there is nothing of that kind now but as long as Sir James worthy man lived there was work going that kept some people employed
No distance at all
Yes the young people
Upper Coll
Mr Hunter
Roderick
It is another township occupied by crofters that marches with us on the other side
The other side is occupied by a crofting township like ourselves
We differ sometimes
The gamekeepers think that at certain seasons of the year they will not allow a man or beast to go upon the moorland pasture and they employ one out upon this moorland pasture during the summer
They keep a man out upon the moorland pasture to take up any man or child whom they may find straying there in case he may be there robbing the nests of the birds
We have no deer now
I remember the dayI was young at the timewhen I could see one hundred deers on the hill and I could not see three now
I dont remember his name exactly
He belongs to Gress
I dont know
He is an English gentleman living in London
Bless you 
have not I seen two lads sent for nine weeks to the prison there for robbing a grouse nest and one of them barely came out alive
That is quite the case but our great complaint is that we are prevented from sending a boy or anybody else out to attend to the cattle
Yes we are
I am not very sure but he may be in the service of both
I believe he is in the service of the man who is the shooting tenant
Yes we look upon him in that light
It is the part of the tenants to be obedient
The waste townships that are under sheep that were cleared before these are the places the people are looking for and would be glad to get
No except Garryghuirm that was formerly cleared
To Mr Hunter
I believe they are in arrears this year
They would stock it by degrees
Yes that they would
Any assistance they might get they would pay it back they dont look for alms
Yes that is quite correct
If it would be as well to do so still the man had to have his cattle sold in order to pay these arrears
They belonged to the incoming tenant
The state of affairs was this that the old man had only one son and he died
He and his wife were getting frail and they had an elderly daughter who was supporting them
Now this daughter was getting parochial relief for attending upon her father and mother and she thought that the rent of the croft should be paid as well as the relief she got for these services she rendered
Now when the young man got the croft there was only  or  of debt and when the debt had increased to  Mr Munro the then chamberlain came and insisted with violent language that the whole of this debt must be paid and the new tenant sold his own two cows and paid the debt
No no relation whatever
His wife was not a relation either
I have heard several instances in addition to this one from whom Mr Munro the chamberlain exacted the arrears of rent in this way
I dont know what the practice may be just now
Ever since the present factor came in there was nothing of that sort done upon us
These things were done by his two predecessors
He would be about ten years in possession
Yes
No
We have a herd for the sheep
And the estate authorities wished there should also be one herd or two herds for the cattle so that there should be no trespassing upon the moorland pasture for the sake of the grouse but the people of the place objected to such an arrangement
Yes that is the rule of the estate
Donald Mlver Nether Coll
Donald Macdonald
Murdo MLeod
His abode is in Glasgow
No they did not come to hear it read
Yes they would and I am not certain but they may blame me for not having made more statements than there are in that paper
But there is nothing in it which I cannot prove and which any person can gainsay
Yes
No
At the meeting one said put in this statement and another said put in that statement but I put in no statement except what I was certain of my own knowledge was true
Yes he merely wrote it to my dictation
He is a native of the place and has come to live at home
I was elected whether I willed or not because I was one of the oldest men and because I speak of old times even before Sir James bought the estate
I am such an age now that I do not require land for myself and I would be giving up land rather than be asking for more
There are about one hundred altogether of whom about fifty pay rent
Yes
About a fortnight ago
There was a large number present but they were not all there
Between forty and sixty probably
The people of the place
They heard that such a thing was to be done
They heard through the country that these proceedings were taken and when they heard of these meetings  they met too
Quite well
Another delegate and I were sent here in order to tell how some of the ground which our fathers occupied before us was taken from us
A moorland pasture of about ten miles broad was distributed between our township and the two tacks that marched with us upon the other side between our township on the one side and the two tacks upon the other side
When these ten miles were portioned out only the breadth of two miles was left with our town and afterwards it appeared to them that even this was too much and one of these two miles was taken from us
We have now scarcely one milethat is all the breadth
Perhaps it extends about five miles back this mile between the sea and the moorland pasture
Then the last rude that was taken from us was added to a tack and we were obliged to pay the sum of  before we were allowed to put a hoof of cattle upon this ground which really was our own
Then if our cattle were three or four weeks out upon the moorland pasture immediately after they came home dogs were set after them and they were placed in pound
The township of North Tolsta was originally under a tack then afterwards it was lotted out among the crofters and over twenty years ago it was made a tack of again and it is now under big sheep
And when they sent away the crofters from that place in order to make a tack of it they sent some of them away to America and others of them they crowded in upon us
This tack is a portion of the township
They crowded in upon us in the rest of the township of North Tolsta the people that were not sent to America in order to make room for the tack
North Tolsta is entirely tack
It is the people of South Tolsta that elected me to come here and they call a portion of it sometimes Balmeanach
So when the people were removed from North Tolsta and South Tolsta in order to clear it for a tack some of them were sent to America and others crowded upon us
It was necessary to make room for them because they were removed from their own place and some of the people of South Tolsta who were in arrears of rent were removed from their own places outside the township in order to make room for those of North Tolsta that were sent in upon them
These got no land and it mattered little whether they were alive or dead so far as the authorities were concerned
There are between fifty and sixty young men in the townshipsome of them married some notwho wish to acquire land and who have not got it
These have been trained in the defence of their Queen and country both on land and sea
These think that a portion of the land which belonged to their forefathers should be given to themthe waste land which is under sheep
There is a great portion of land now lying wasteuncultivated under sheepperfectly capable of supporting these people if they could only get it
Under the turf of this land there lies the possibility of plenty of oatmeal and barleymeal for the sustenance of these people if they only could get possession of it
It is sad to see that the people whom God created for His own glory should be crowded in together upon each other to make room for big sheep
As we heard a good man belonging to Caithness sayingThe landlords said that the earth was theirs while the scripture saith that the earth is the Lords and the fulness thereof
It was not taken from us
These ten miles belonged to these two tacks and our township and when the appointment was made only two miles were  left with us
No that could not be said because the ten miles belonged to the two tacks and us
Yes that was the case
No our share would have been two miles but then they took away more than one of these two miles from us
Our complaint is with respect even to the two miles that it is less than our proper share
If it were properly divided we should have over three  three and a third
Yes that was our first complaint
Yes that is our second complaint
More than a mile was taken from us and less than a mile left with us
Just moorland pasturepeat
A mile of moorland pasture will not feed much stock
I cannot exactly tell how much they feed the most of their stock without fence of their crofts
If we got it back we would keep more stock than we keep today but in addition there were over twenty families thrown upon us
No
The tack of North Tolsta was taken from us and it would yield crops if we got it back
Over twenty years ago
All the arable land of that tack was taken from us
It was arable at that time and people were living upon it
It is now pasture land
Yes
About thirtyone years ago
Yes it was raised
About 
Between  and 
Gress
Thomas Newal is the manager of North Tolsta
The tenant is a young man and I do not know his name
Mrs Liddle is the tenant of Gress
I cannot tell perhaps there may have been about twenty
Twentythree
My neighbour and I cannot agree between twenty and thirty as to the number who were there first
I cannot tell
No I cannot tell how many went to America
Yes
From ten to fifteen families of those that were in North Tolsta were sent in on our township
I object
I would like they should have time in order to pay up their arrears
It might be made up in a short time even supposing they were in arrears and they should not be removed to make room for other men
I cannot tell
At the time they were removed the markets were bad and there was no price for cattle and they were taking away the cattle without leave asked in order to pay up these arrears
The proprietors people were removing cattle in order to pay their arrears without asking leave
They themselves fixed any price upon them that they pleased
Yes they might do that but they were gathering them in a certain place and the proprietors people were fixing the prices of them
Yes but the prices were so low
Yes
No
Ever since I was born
I know that the men were removed but I do not know of any of the transactions between them and the miller
There were eight of them there that had land but it is four who are concerned in this matter
They were removed from where they were and their place was added to the house that you have heard already was left vacant
From the one side of the march to the other side
Yes upon the new lots
I am not aware
Nine years
No
I did not hear anybody complaining except those four
There were two or three of them that had a house on the other side of the street
It was taken from themthe house they had on the one side of the road
Twentythree or twentyfour with land and three without land
They ask me to state nothing except that they were paying the rent of that house that is mentioned in the paper
No
Yes
No
I have been here all my days
Yes
No I am just a boatbuilder and supply fishermen with boats
Sometimes I used to build six or seven
It has been something about the same for a good while back
Yes
Yes  they all use boats that are built at the port or at Stornoway
Sometimes
That depends on the number of boatbuilders that are together
It will give enough to one man to build these
More for the curers
Yes they buy the boats of us
They give them the boats on three years shares
The boat comes to  and that is  a year for three seasons
If the crew can clear it off in three seasons the boat is theirs  but if not it is the property of the curer
Yes if they are engaged to fish for the curer
Yes
Yes that is a separate agreement
They have another agreement for the ling
That the curer shall pay so much per hug from this date until th July or whatever it is and the settlement will be in November
They are independent of that if they like
They need not go to the curer if they dont like
The curer is bound to pay them
Yes the shell of them and the ropes and mast but not including the sail

The boat cannot go out without lines
The total cost is about  or 
Yes
No
Yes
Not more than twentyfive or thirty
The excavation is too small
It will be thirteen feet nine inches but it is only a small boat that it can accommodate
There are no rocks in the way
Yes
The breakwater is going up on them
They are going to run the pier on the top of them
Yes they must blast when they are excavating to that depth
I know it will
A great deal
If I had  today I would put it into it and I would be sure of it being paid back very soon
That is how I would build it for the locality is too poor to expect anything out of it
I would lay out the money in that way and charge dues
They could go east or west from such a harbourfrom Carloway to Cape Wrath
A good many hundreds at this time of the year
I dont know how many are at Stornoway now
Yes
These are the ling fishermenthe men who are depending on this harbour
Yes it would do for them to come into if it was larger
It could be made larger
I was round the place with the engineer and I know the route well enough
Yes and they could have a deepwater harbour
Yes
Yes
Yes I believe they would
No I do not
When I remember first they would take notice of a man whom they saw on the street that was in debt to the curers and now you cannot see a man without that except very very few
They can put their finger on every one today
It is due to the bad seasons and bad fishing and the system of working they have in the ling fishing
They have to go out and set their lines and they have a big stone at the end of the lines and a rope up to the top of the water with a buoy
So when the herring boats come they are setting their own nets and these are drifted and they carry away the lines
I agree with that
I believe that the herring fishing and ling fishing cannot be done in the same place
It ought to be done in the way of winter ling fishing and summer herring fishing
That seems the great cause
It is a very good boat that takes  ling this year
I remember when they were taking
I cannot go into that at all
My suggestion is that a large harbour should be built here and that they should get large boats as their neighbours do from the east coast
All these men have to go to the east coast and must be under masters who can do with them as they like engaging them at such a price as they can give them and they have not even one net of their own
I have seen them coming home with from  to  and some of them with less than  some years
Yes according to the fishing
They are just taking them at so much per cran
I think they are more suitable for fishermen than for farmers
They cannot do both and it is at the same time that both things should be prosecuted
Yes for I see all these fishermen on the east coast and I know a few of them
No they may just have an acre or so as a garden
That is my idea
I am sure that fishing and farming cannot be done together
Well I should like them to have a garden
If they could keep one cow it would be a great benefit to them
Lady Matheson gave  and the Fishery Board gave 
Yes  I know there was
No but I wrote a letter to Mr Gladstone for it
I know there is a Loans Board
I dont think so
The present work need not be thrown away at all and I was very much pleased when I saw from the plans that they could make a continuation of a large harbour
Well I do not know
I doubt it very muchthis piece they are making just nowfor it is just a piece they are running on the front out to the sea and there is not a back to it
That is the worst I saw about the plan and I objected to it the moment I saw it
I think not
If there was another one at the back of it and a hearting and a parapet the same as the rest of it it would be sufficient to stand the waves  for the outsweep of the sea here is stronger than at any place the Stevensons saw in their life and I am afraid it will take the corner of the outer pier out
No not with the present wall
Yes there is five feet of water at lowest spring water according to my plan
I do not know very well but I think eight feet will do well enough
Not any one
I suppose it is the sanitary inspector
There is a sanitary inspector paid to do it and he ought to look after it
The sanitary inspector for the parish of Barvas
He lives in Stornoway
I am very much disgusted with it but I cannot help it I would like to see it clean
No reason
They could keep it as clean as any town in Scotland for there is a burn there and they could clean everything down to it
We are fifty feet higher than the level of the sea and there is always running water
I dont suppose there has I do not know
Hector Ross he is the parochial inspector too
Yes  I have seen him often come over here
I never heard it
Two and a half years
Rossshire
Not sufficienty to speak it fluently
I understand it better than I can speak it
Occasionally
One explanation is that the children do not come punctually to school in the morning and Scripture knowledge is taught from ten to a quarter before eleven and by that time the children have not done dropping into school
If they came in proper time they would get their full allowance of religious knowledge
The Government lay down a code in which it is provided that there must be two consecutive hours of teaching without Scripture knowledge
Not that I am aware of
Yes
I am not aware of that
It is
Yes
Yes
No but they all understand the English language sufficiently to understand the teacher when explaining it
The teacher makes a point of using the simplest language he can and they are quite able to understand him when he explains the Catechism or the Bible
No they have not in this school or in those of our district that I am aware of
Yes and reading the simplest parts of the Bible
Some of them do in fact most of them do
I think in most cases it is learned by rote
It is only the more intelligent of the children who can understand it thoroughlyin fact there are some of the questions that it would take more than a child to understand
It cannot be that because the children have not the command of the English language so well as Englishspeaking children
I dont think it would
I find when any Gaelic is used in school the children are more apt to stick to the Gaelic
They speak too much Gaelic outside for the benefit of the English teaching in the school during the day
I cannot say they learn English better but I am quite aware they learn it as well at any rate
That is my own opinion
Very irregular especially this year
They make the want of clothes a great excuse especially this spring
I find the attendance is very much below the average of the past season
The insufficiency of their other clothing rather
Yes
I think the rates could be reduced very much by a better attendance of the children
There is for this districtfor the two schools of Lionel and Cross
Very strenuous efforts indeed
The parents do not pay much heed to him
Their name is legion
Some of them during the springtime say they require the children to stay at home to help them in tilling the ground and the smaller ones to take care of their younger brothers and sisters
After the labour the herring fishing comes on and after the herring fishing the taking home of the peats and the girls require to stay at home to mind the house and so on
For the past years examination it was  this year it will be very much below that
Yes I obtained a grant of  on  presented for examination
The average attendance was
Close on  and sometimes it goes over
There is a great difficulty in the first place to get the children who are just of age to come to schooL The parents do not appear to be willing to let them come
Then after ten the children are kept for working and after thirteen they are gradually taken away altogether
They always take notice of it and direct that defaulting parents should be warned
On the occasion of almost every meeting they have there are defaulting parents before them
They brought some of the parents before the sheriff
They all got off except one man who was confined for two days
They have been up several times before the sheriff during the last two years
I opened one when I came here and kept it going till a month ago when I had to close it for want of scholars
I had one man who kept a Gaelic class to teach the Bible and Catechism in Gaelic
From five to halfpast six or seven
Yes it is very convenient it is after the parents come home from church
Yes
I think it was simply owing to the want of interest which the parents took in their children having Sabbath school instruction
Boys and girls
Sometimes  or  when I started first
There is a Sabbath school kept in the Cross school in connection with the same church
I dont think it is very well attended in the meantime
Yes
No
I suppose although you have been only two and a half years here you have had some scholars who left the school with their elementary education completed
Yes
I should say about a couple of dozen who were fairly good scholars
The most of them speak English very well and those who speak it best are the best Gaelic readers
Quite well
I believe there are some
I cannot say how they learn it
Some of them can read Gaelic and their parents cannot
I think the English assists them
I believe there is one at Sgigersta still in operation
The teacher of that Gaelic school was at one time appointed by the board to come to this school to give Gaelic instruction and the former teacher left it to the option of the children to attend this class or not  and in about three  months time they dropped off
There were not more than a dozen at the beginning and they dropped off to one who was the teachers son
They prefer the English
Very small some days it is not held at all I believe
Yes
You have already heard how the people have been losing their right over the land and how the rent has been increased
That is a very sad thing for poor people when they are unable to pay for their land and are in danger of losing the holding they have they being unable to pay the landlord
We can do nothing else now than lift up our voices in complaint to the rulers of the land and to the proprietor to see if they will remove as much of that burden as they can before we lose what we have in part of debts and also that those rulers and the proprietor should spread the people over the face of the land where there is plenty of land and to spare where they might be able to live in comfort
It was the people who were better off and who had most stock that were examined here today as delegates
There is a large proportion of the people who have no stock at all
You heard already how the rents were increased by former chamberlains Mr Mackenzie and Mr Munro
We have no cause of complaint against the chamberlain and ground officer of today
Fresh land was brought under cultivation down at the Port within the borders of our township and crofters were placed there and because of the badness of the soil and the high rent they were not able to pay
When John Hunter found this out he relieved them of a portion of the rent so as to enable them to live and added that to our rent which was already too high
Then about the Galston matter of which you have heard although we are far removed from the march and though no creature of ours ever went there or ever shall d was placed on each of us for that fence and Is d per pound was added to our rents on account of muirland pasture the effect of which was to provide laud with no rent at all for the Galston tenant
The delegate who immediately preceded me can explain that better but there is a successor who also can explain it
Yes
Things are dark and hard by land and sea in those years
Very much
Very much indeed
I remember myself the boat of which I formed one of the crew landing  ling in a season and a neighbouring boat  and now they can scarcely make  in a season
Sixpence
Yes
The fishing was better this year but the season was very mild and they were not prepared to take advantage of it
Yes and the herring fishers injure our fishing
They should set bounds between the ling ground and the herring ground so that the one would not injure the other as they do now
It should be so arranged that one set of fishings should occupy one portion of the sea and the other portion the other
I believe that the ling frequents all parts but we have particular banks for the ling fishing
Yes
Well that might be
If it was a good year I would prefer the outside limit
I have seen them go twenty miles past the north end of the island
They can keep the high land in clear weather
The ling fishermen stay out that way but they are bound to stay out and watch their lines otherwise these may be destroyed by the herring boats
Twenty feet keel
They pull them up beyond the seamark every night
Six
Some of them fish for themselvesthe few that can
Yes those who can buy boats wish to have them
A boat well found without the lines would cost about 
For the small lines they take limpets and other shell fish which they get on the shore and with these small lines they catch haddocks and then they bait the long lines with the haddocks
They also get eels and turbot upon their long lines
Yes
They use all the turbot for bait
London is very far from here
Yes sometimes
In summer if they can go far enough to sea and have all bait they would have plenty of turbot
The fishing is not regular
It is only in good weather that they can go far enough out to sea where they can get it in abundance
Yes
No that fish has got scarce
About three miles west of this
Yes
Regarding their poverty
I have more than time will allow me to tell
You have heard already of the small holdings and the high rents and I need not enter into details on that matter
They are very poor
Some are in want of food
That is their sorest cry
The land is so heavily burdened that it cannot yield crop and just as that is the case the land that is pastured on by sheep is as it were crying out to be cultivated
We complain of the heavy assessments
The schools are a very great burden upon us
We were not used to that burden and our poverty scarcely can bear it well
We prefer the schools we had before
Our objection to the present mode of education is that the rule which the Almighty has given us for our salvation is treated as a boy plays at skippackjust a slap and be done with it
Yes that it is merely a name
I have nothing to say against the late proprietor or against Lady Matheson although they had bad managers under them and just as the proprietors were badly served in our district so the Government is badly served in our district also
I must tell of a piece of impertinence where we were made a laughing stock of by the whipperin of the childrenthat is the officer of the School Boardjust that he opened a letter that we were sending to Mr Mackay the chamberlain
Mr Mackay himself knows about it
When there is such an amount of distress as that these are not suitable people as they would say in England to administer a new colony
Our poverty would plead for patience and compassion in dealing with us
To put it in one word the state of the place ought to be a matter of serious concern and humiliation to the people that are assembled here today
It is as though we were suffering from the wrath of the Almighty upon mans sin
I am quite certain that they do
They do not understand what they are learning
A small portion at the beginningthe easy bit
Oh
what but English that they dont understand
No not at all
No we did not
We complain of it
I believe we have that power
I understand that quite well but I wish to state in reply that the officer when he did the act was quite convinced that he was backed by sufficient authority
To the compulsory officer to bring it to the post office
Yes
It never was put into the post office
Well we went to search for that letter and we could not get it in his house until his son would come home from school
We found it then and we knew that it had been opened
There was an address upon it then in a different handwriting from the original one
He was spoken to about it at the School Board
He said the man ought to be taken up
The fiscal would have nothing to do with it because he was not a servant of the post office
No
Well I do not want a man to be destroyedkilled indeedbut I wish that evil deeds should cease
I wish that would come about
Yes I heard that but every person in this district is not a minister and as such able to shoe his children so that they can go to school
That is the case
There is no man here who is more anxious that children should be educated than I am but I see clearly that cannot be done
I believe that the parents do not in that sense do as much as they could
I am further of opinion that if the man who introduced the Bill into Parliament had been a Ness fisherman or a fisherman on the West side of Lewis he would not have introduced such a measure at all
That is quite the case
Donald Murray Tabost

In Balmeanach there were ten families in Melbost twentyfive and in South Galston thirteen
Over several years
They were removed at intervals during a period of twelve years
Twenty years ago
The whole of it and without his knowledge
No
Mr Munro Mackenzie to begin with and then Mr Munro
It was given to the tacksman
Yes that was the case
I could not ask to be better off
Almost the whole of them were so at first but at a later period the tenants of South Galston were added on to them and then they were not so well off
About forty of them went to America
The rest was scattered all over the country
Yes it was against our will but we went away without being summoned
I dont know one who benefited by it except one family
Angus Graham now in Shader
He got better land where he went to than the land he was put out of
There was a reason for giving him a favour too  he built a slated house in that place
I would have some of my furniture there before I slept if I got it
There is a Sabbath school in the schoolhouse up in our place for about an hour
The schoolmaster with some assistants
I cannot tell I will not allow any one to go to it myself anyhow
They are making a greater amount of mischief going and coming than they are obtaining good within it
Yes
Yes
I that think that the island of Lewis would have been very much the better and very fortunate indeed if the present factor had been appointed when Mr Munro Mackenzie was appointed
I myself paid rents to three factors and I have seen him do what neither of his two predecessors didthat is to wipe off arrears which poor people could not pay
Our people complain that they are still suffering from the oppression and highhandedness of the two former factors Mr Mackenzie and Mr Munro
An old man of eighty in our township tells me that he saw the township occupied by seven families and that the rent of it at that time was  s d
Today it is  s in addition to taxes
There are thirtyfive paying rent and one not
They complain that for the last thirteen or fourteen years  a year of rent is imposed upon the district from Shader downwards which ought properly to be paid by the farm of Galston
I cannot personally testify to this but the people complain that that is the case
There is a succeeding delegate who can explain these matters better than I can
They complain of the want of land and that the rent of what they have is high
I believe it has been much about the same ever since I remember as it is today
I only came to this place fifteen years ago
South Dell in this parish
Yes
I exchanged with another man
No
Work does not decrease but blacksmiths increase and so the amount of work which each gets is less but there is more work going
At Swainbost
About half a mile
About the same
The carts are not fewer probably they are more numerous
A horse two cows two young animals twenty sheep
 s in addition to taxes
Yes very much
The very year I came Mr Hunter then ground officer rearranged the rents
He increased the rent at that time
There was s that used to be paid in labour and this man imposed it upon us in the name of moorland pasture as rent
Then he charged s a head extra to defray the cost of the estate books in which he entered down our names in the rent roll that is he told us so
Then there was hen money Is and my share of the rent of Galston about s in the pound I believe
But our township pays less in proportion than any other township in Ness of this Galston rent
I used to hear that other townships were charged s a pound for this Galston business
I reckoned it about s
Why was it put down in the name of moorland pasture because we were paying for the moorland pasture before
He did it through highhandedness
I do not complain so much of the high rent as of the small holding
If I had a third more land I would be much better offor perhaps half as much again
To tell the truth I believe that the one source of industry injures the other
If I had half as much again of land I might perhaps keep a pair of horses and a servant lad and then I could give my whole time to my own trade but as it is I am injured by acting as a tradesman today and acting as a farmservant tomorrow
No they are not exactly the same
The old custom of the country was that each crofter paid a peck of corn as blacksmiths dues for keeping his agricultural implements in good order but now the people have got very poor and they cannot pay us in grain or money so that we tradesmen suffer in that way
The price varies depending upon the price of coal and iron
A few years ago these were very dear and we charged s for a complete set or Is per shoe
We do it just now for s per set or d per shoe
It is much cheaper than it was some years ago
It would be about s fifteen years ago
The s was a few years ago when we paid very high for iron and coal
We give credit and we are none the better of it sometimes
They are less able
They would pay if they could
Yes
The great poverty of the place is the cause of it
John Macdonald
That is what the ground officer himself told me
About fifteen years
Hunter did an additional act of highhandedness in our township which I had forgot
He took land from an old man who had a croft there and he gave him a new croft and of that croft there was only brought under cultivation at the expense of the proprietor a small bit and the crofter himself stated that he got it at the rent of waste land
Afterwards this ground officer John Hunter doubled the rent and deprived him of his horse
Allan Graham
He took from him his horse in payment of arrears
The man had a weak family and was scarcely able to keep matters agoing
I believe I can get plenty of witnesses to whom he said it as well as to me
We pay it yet
It was added on as additional rent
I had the ground officers own statement for it
Yes
No doubt whatever
I believe he said it to many another man as well as me
In our own township
He is in the new croft he got
No I dont think he is here today
I asked him to come but he did not come
We dont know what he may have done with it
I only repeat his own statement
Yes
It is a small township surrounded by a fence out at the back of this place here
When I was born my father and another man occupied it between them
About sixty years ago they placed twelve families there in order to prosecute the fishing
Then six of these and my own father were drowned fortyeight years ago
They got the whole township at  a year at that time and now it is  We cannot keep but two cows each
We are surrounded by a ring fence in our township
We are seven miles from the march of Galston tack and though none of our cattle ever went there or ever shall still we have had to pay s d a family for this fence which has been spoken of
Then they placed six other tenants upon our township within our boundary fence
This was done in Munro Mackenzies time
The boat foundered in a storm off the shore here
There were two similar accidents since that time
The one was exactly similar and the other was during a comparative calm
About twenty years ago in a great drift off the shore to Sutherlandshire and Rossshire
Some of them are larger and more seaworthy boats but there are others just about the same size as those
My neighbours can make nothing of the land
Unless they take their livelihood out of the sea they cannot live at all
No one was ever deterred in my township by fear of consequences
The crofts in my townships are so small that they cannot be subdivided
I have myself two sons and they have not the breadth of my palm of land
Yes
A younger brother than I stayed in the house then
That brother was drowned since
There are six alive today whose husbands were drowned
Of course there were many more who are dead
Sixteen
They have a little land as we ourselves have
Two of them have only half crofts
They just live as Providence bestows upon them
Yes
If it succeeds certainly
I cannot judge very well only I know that the sea would be very violent there at times but still skill will prevail
No I have not seen the works
Yes they injure them very much
My own sons lines were three times taken away this year
He got the lines a neighbour got them for him
Sometimes they are lost
They have no place to keep the boats
Yes
If all the expense that has been incurred on this port had been incurred in our place of Sgigersta it would be a better advantage than ever could be made here
I believe they injure the supply of fish as well
At all events the fishing has fallen off since my recollection
Even with the quay it would not hold much of a fleet
Yes and as brave
There are no better seamen afloat
Yes
Well the previous delegate is from the same township and I have nothing to say except that I remember the time when there were only eleven families in it
Sixtysix although two are not on the rent roll
Nothing except that the increase which was mentioned was not done by the act of the present managers of the estate
Several came from various townships in this parishnone from outside the parish
Others belonged to the place
Yes there was some of that
I dont remember they did
If they tried it they did not succeed
What could be done with them
I could not know what I would do with my son or with my daughter
I would only ask for myself as I would ask for others
I dont know
But there was one thing that when the third or fourth part of the croft was taken there was a tax imposed by the landlord for roads and so on
He would not do it for such a small consideration as that but still it was allowed
There can be no question of its having been allowed
I would undoubtedly be very much against it but still it would be a very hard thing to carry out
I would not know what to do with my son and daughter
The proprietor at one time wished to insist upon it that a married son or daughter should not be admitted to the house but things were too hard for him
He was not able to carry carry out his wishes
Well if they got an abatement of rent things would be easier for them
I dont know what they might do but one thing is that the rent is very high
You can see from these receipts the change which has been made on the rent within the last twenty years
I can give no answer to that question
I dont know that they could do more by fishing
They risk their lives as it is and since the herring fishing commenced off the shore here they cannot very well leave out their lines the herring nets break them
Well I cannot tell now that the herring fishermen are injuring our fishing in the way I have mentioned
Not often
They dont hear such good news always from these places
Yes
Some of their relatives have a sad enough story to tell others are better off
I cannot tell
For my own part I am too old to emigrate
Well they do occasionally speak among themselves that they must go somewhere but they are so poor that they cannot go unless some assistance of that kind was given
There is no doubt they are strongly against emigrating and is it not rather a hard thing that they should be made to emigrate while sheep are being fed at home
I believe there would be very few indeed
Fish every day they can
Almost all their success at the fishing now is in the winter and early spring before the herring fishermen come
The cod and ling fishing is carried on by leaving the lines out at night and these lines must have buoys upon them and if you leave a line out it may be that before morning it will be in Stornoway
The ordinary herring boats
By far the greater number
Gather seaware and various things
They will not at all be idle
Those that get that moorland pasture of ours will be taking new land others of them will be improving it
Those who have got such work to dothat is those who have fresh unbroken land as part of their crofts
Yes
Yes there is especially a strip visible that stretches out to the moorland pasture from the high road
Yes
The first piece that was taken off our township of this outside pasture I believe was drained and done by the factor at the time himself but the people have been going at it since
 s d
Two cows and two stirks
Five or six perhaps
A horse
I cannot tell
The surveyor who measured it the other day told me it was  acres and that includes those wide ditches between every plot
Yes they all pay as high a rate and they all complain
I know nothing about it
Yes
Thirtyfour or thirtyfive years ago there were twenty families in Lionel
There are now sixtysix  but there is a piece of it that belongs to the Port of Ness and a part to the hill of Adbroc and some to Eoradale
There were three pieces taken away
Chamberlain Mackenzie took away the piece given to the Port and factor Munro took away the piece given to Eoradale and Adbrochill
There are crofters in each of these places
Lionel has now no hill pasture except about  yards in breadth from the boundary of Adbroc to the boundary of Habost and it is almost wholly cut up with dykes
The Lionel people have also to complain that there has been a great increase of rent for the last twenty years  as the receipts I produce will indicate
My years rent paid in October  was    s d of which s was for road money and s for kain
In October  the rent was    s  poor rates s d  road assessment Is  d   school rate s   black dyke d total    s d
In  the total was    s
Id the rent being the same as in  and the poor rate and school rate being reduced
I cannot tell perfectly but this I can say that Hunter was ground officer and Munro chamberlain
Not at all
The boundaries are the same as before
Twelve or thirteen years ago we were obliged to erect a dyke between our moor and Galston
I had five continuous days to work at it myself
I worked another day afterwards in autumnthat is six daysand I never worked so hard in the Highlands or Lowlands or working at the lighthouse here as I did those six days all at my own cost See Appendix A XLI
When the dyke was finished and passed by the chamberlain the stewart of Galston and the constable there was a tax of d laid upon us to keep up that dyke
In saying so I do not say anything against Sir James Matheson or against his lady
He was a kind gentleman and she was a kind lady  nor do I say anything against the present chamberlain or ground officer who received everything as it is now
The crofters did the whole work and we did not get as much as one potato
Not a halfpenny
I dont know that he contributes anything to the keeping up of the dyke
Not the least
He has the advantage that from the lie of the ground and the slope of the dyke they can easily jump over to our side but ours cannot do the same to his
We are not rich enough even to put wire fences round our own corn stacks
We have said nothing about it to the present factor
We were too terrified to say a word about it to the former factor and ground officer because if we had made any such request the immediate reply would have been that our land would be taken from us
Upon each family on the rent roll
I know nothing about that
It is not the present tenant who put this trouble upon us
It was a former tenant named Smith
I am not constantly occupiedabout seventeen weeks in the year
When the women get something of ease from the working of the land they then get the wool in order
Blankets and kealt and coverlets
Those who have sheep of their own send their own wool
Those who have not perhaps get wool from the fishcurers who employ them
Yes
On the contrary our rent was raised
Certainly
Yes that the back hill pasture was taken from us and that our land is too little
Decidedly so
There is not so much difference in one respect because the population has increased compared with what it was formerly and there are not so many people practising the weaving art as there were when I was young but a person who could formerly give me fifteen yards to make has perhaps not more than five now
Most assuredly
Formerly when a person did a clever thing it was said of him that the black blood had gone into his bones meaning he was well nourished upon milk and meat once a week at least and now we have become so low in condition that those whom I have seen with ten cows three or four cows yielding milk cannot now keep up two cows because of the scarcity of land and they can never have any meat
Another thing I observed when I was working as a servant before I married
As the Lord gave the commandment to Moses concerning the land that it should have rest every seventh year and that the land was bringing forth its fruit I have seen with my own eyes when I was a young man labouring with crofters that they used to leave an acre of their land fallow in rotation every third or fourth year and when they had completed this rotation they would begin again at the portion that had been left fallow
That ground would yield crop without any manure but now as the land is so scarce they cannot do so any more
It was a small wage but better than a big wage today
s s or  in the half year
Some of them will now get  or  in the half year
Women do not get so much
Yes
No
I was born in Uig and I was upon two occasions deprived of some of my possessions in the parish of Uig
In the first place we were deprived of hill pasture which was given to the neighbouring tack and then our stock was taken from us
Over fifty years ago
It was added to the tack of Mr Macrae Huishnish
Then we were obliged to subsist as best we could upon the crofts and a little of hill pasture behind to graze our stock upon
Subsequently we were summoned out of the parish altogether and then we were deprived of everything we possessedcattle sheep and everything else
The people asked the chamberlain at the time what he was then going to do with them when they had no homes and he pointed to the sea and told them their home was there
The people had to part with their sheep having no place to keep them in and they sold them to the tacksmen at s d to s d each
We were then sent to Ness where we are
Our township was then occupied by a tacksman who fell into debt and so the place was lotted out for us
In  or thereabouts
I am now going to speak of the recent management of the estate and I see the chamberlain before me and the ground officers upon the other side of me and though there is a good deal of truthful statements that are welling up within me I am in a difficulty and it is the goodwill and favour of the factor that I should prefer to his wrath
I am exceedingly obliged to you I can now speak the truth with courage
We got that township at a rent of the township of Swainbost
We had it at that rent for about eleven years
Sir James then came after purchasing the estate
A kindhearted gentleman he was and after looking over the estate he saw a good deal of waste land that he was anxious to bring under cultivation
Between himself and the GovernmentI dont know whichhe sent men who trenched and brought under cultivation a good deal of land
Now because of these improvements that were made and the rent of the money that was expended upon them through the Government and the proprietorit was in Mr Munro Mackenzies factorship that this occurredthe rent was increased
The whole work was carried on under the inspectorship I suppose of a Government inspector at all events he was in the service so far as I understood of the Government and Sir James Matheson
At that time Mr Munro Mackenzie cut off and formed into a park the inward portion of our township
We were deprived of this portion
Upon the other side of us again there were crofters settled upon land that was taken in so that in a way we are enclosed in a fank
Then Mr Munro came and my firm conviction is that his policy from the first day of his factorship to the last was to extirpate the Lewis people so far as he could
If I did not appear upon the rent collection day at White House during Mr Munros factorship supposing I went back a week afterwards and prevented it he would fine me for not having been there upon the appointed day
He then appointed a ground officer of the name of John Hunter the like of whom never appeared in the Lewis in my day
He was a very bad ground officerthe worst ground officer I ever saw
They seemed very much pleased to work together and it is within the truth to say that from one end of Lewis to the other such was the dread of the people for them that they groaned even in their beds for fear of the two men
Then the people of my native country quarrelled with the factor and things came to a head and I dont believe that Sir James knew of matters ever during that time
I believe it was a special dispensation of Providence but the end of it was that factor his ground officer and everybody else were turned about their business
But now we have got a factor and a ground officer appointed for us under whom we can rest in peace as if it were out of the heel of necessity
When they saw the condition in which this township of ours was they made a slight abatement for every crofter within it
Over forty
By about eleven or twelve
Yes there were many additions made from the various townships within this parishnone from outside the parish
Yes Galston
About seventyeight families
There were two Galstons South and North and there was Melbost as well
That is all I can recollect
Some of them came to Ness and some were crowded in upon other townships on the west side
Yes several went to America
Yes
I cannot sayprobably the last were sent away about twenty years ago
Yes
Yes Melbost in particular
The people were about as comfortable so far as stock and other things were concerned as any people on the west side
Yes in that township
They were well off
I cannot answer that question
Those who came to this parish are not better off anyhow
I speak of the time before we were deprived of that moorland pasture and the people then were comfortable for the condition of croftersmuch better and more comfortably off than the people in my neighbourhood now
Yes they are increasing
Yes
The natural increase of the place
Until they get land they have no suitable means of subsistence
Yes I do
Upon my side of the township Hunter the ground officer took three yards in breadth from end to end off each croft
Before that time I was not in arrear
Since that time I am in arrears
I have not got over it and I have had to purchase for my own family ever since
About fifteen years ago
A man who came from Caithness to whom he gave a lot
His widow and son
When he took these three yards of breadth from us he added s to the rent
Mr Munro and Hunter
Mr MFarquhar explained this matter to the succeeding ground officer who explained it to the present factor and he took s offhe considered it so outrageous
There were some from a distance but there were the people of the place also
Yes the greater number
There were a few Skyemen
It was necessary to make an addition then
There was a shilling in the pound put on for the expense incurred and each five years in addition the rent was being raised
He was very anxious to prevent the subdivision of crofts and to scatter the people over the face of the earth
No he could not prevail upon the proprietor in spite of that
If he could he would
He would do as much mischief as he could
He fined me    s quite unjustly because I had overstock
Their complaint is my own
They wish to get more land to make their livelihood out of it
Yes but the fishing went against them and of late it rather increased their debt and made them poorer
From  to 
 s
Two cows a quey stirk and nine sheep
The potatoes in an average year would last till the first month of spring and my own meal never lasted altogether till summer and it would not come near that except that I used to purchase some
If I had as much again as I have I think I could make things meet
Yes they are just in the same condition
There are twentythree townships in the parish in which I was born where the people sent their own produce to the mill
I think that would be a happy day for the people if that was done
I cannot speak for the parish of Barvas
There was not so much clearing in Barvas as in the other parishes
I cannot speak of the future
I can speak of the present and if the large tacks in this parish were apportioned among the people I know that the people in this parish could be put into a comfortable position
That the poverty of the people was caused by overcrowding
Fortythree
Twentyeight crofts
In my fathers time there were twenty lots
Twenty
In my recollection there were twentyeight crofts but probably abont thirtythree families
The greater number of them belonged to the place
A few were sent in upon us from Galston
Two
About twenty years ago
I do not remember who got it twenty years ago but at present it is vacant so far as I know
The old tenant has not yet been succeeded
About four miles broad
It would keep sixty families comfortably
With its own hill pasture just as it is
There are four townships
The greater number of them went to America
Others of them were scattered here and there
Yes we are quite convinced of that
I believe just now the two Bragars are only two miles broad and there are over  souls on them
The pasture is necessarily injured by overeating and it is necessarily exhausted
Yes it is very nearly worse than if it did not exist at all
Yes it is of worse quality than when I was young
That accounts for it partly and the inferior pasture accounts for it too
The best of the pasture land we had was settled upon six crofts
Then there was an additional s added on from  to  It has not been put on the last two additions to the township which were made during Mr Mackays time
Everything contributes to overstocking
As the rent is increased overstocking follows of necessity
My croft is only twentynine yards broad and is about one mile long
That is the only way in which those who remain can be made comfortable
My opinion is that if we had to face such a contingency we would cast lots and deal fairly
Yes we do
Yes
Yes
To Her Majestys Royal Commissioners for Highlands and Islands
Statement made by the People in the District of Arnol Parish of BarvasGentlemen during the last fourteen years s has been added to our rent
Formerly there were only nineteen families in this township now there are fortyfive who pay rent and ten who have no land
The best of our cattle were taken from us some years ago and very little value given us in return
We pay  for the right of fishing in Arnol River
That right was taken from us but the   is still upon the township
Three crofters say that they had to pay   as a bonus before the got their lots
It is the natural increase of the people
There were only one or two families from outside
They were taken away from us at different times in the time of the groundofficer Macdonald
There was no special reason for it
It was not rent time
About twenty years ago
No
The matter was this way
Nobody remembers now when this   was charged against the township for the right of fishing in the river
It was a matter of so long ago that the people came to believe that the right was theirs to fish in the river so that the nets they used had to be carried away not during the day but during the night
Yes
It is let now and to tell the truth we were deprived of the right fiftyfour years ago
It is true all the same
It is for houses
There were no arrears of rent upon the crofts that these men entered into
One of the lots was occupied by a bedridden man  years of age whose son was fifty or sixty at the time
He was not a penny in arrears except the rent of the current year
It so happened that he was not present on the rent collection day but he turned up a month thereafter
When this man went with his rent to Stornowayit was in Mr Munros timeand offered his rent a month after the rent collection day the rent had been already paid by the new entrant
The new entrant built a house right in front of the old mans door so that he could scarcely enter it with a creel of peats on his back
In the case of the other man there were no arrears of rent and he paid the   in addition to the rent
In these cases there were no houses and he only paid the  for the privilege of being entered in the rent roll of the proprietor
I cannot tell but I believe the ground officer handled the money first
Certainly I did
Yes
This is the memorial of the people of Upper Barvas
A great many
Twentyfour
One
There is no pauper staying in Upper Barvas except one girl and perhaps also a young child
It is the paupers of the whole parish
Paupers
The whole parish
The people belonged to the place
Few if any outsiders were placed among us
In  in addition to the twelve who were paying rent there were two who did not pay rent at that time and who were allowed crofts afterwards
Yes a whole croft
I have too many for my croft this year
I have three cows three young beasts about twenty head of sheep and one horse
 s not including taxes
When I said I was overstocked this year I meant that I had more stock than the croft can properly feed
I have no summing
That has gone out of fashion and we are none the better for that
We would require to buy a great deal this year if we could only get it but it was so scarce that we could hardly get it
We always buy more or less
In a good year we do not buy anything to speak of but we get a good deal of their provender out of the shoreseaware
I would probably almost have to pay about  in order to maintain my present stock properly in an average year
To the whole of them
No not the sheepthe cattle
Yes
It is very good for them when they have other provender along with it It is tangle
Right off the shore and they go away down to the sea themselves to eat i t Of course the people bring it up for them too
Yes and it sometimes kills them but that is only at a certain time of the year
In the spring of the year we require to be particularly careful when they get this seaware lest it may kill them
I saw sixteen killed by the seaware one day but it is only for a very short period of the year that there is that great danger and we are very careful at that time
The cows are at all times very fond of this seaware and when they get down to the shore and get an abundant supply they take too much but when the people bring it home to them they regulate the supply to a moderate quantity
At the beginning of spring they are weaker being worse fed and in worse condition than at any other time and it is worse for them when they get a gorge of it
Yes it is very good especially at this time of the year
Straw
Potatoes for example are not so good along with it as straw is
Yes generally there is plenty but sometimes we complain
There are some places better than others jo nn
Yes
No
The only tacksman in our neighbourhood is the minister of the parish Mr Strachan and he and we are upon very good terms and we are quite free to go upon his foreshore and he upon ours to take seaware
In the days of John Munro Mackenzie there was a march between Lower and Upper Barvas and he stated that Upper Barvas got more than its fair proportion of land
Our arable land was equal but he assigned a certain portion of pasture land to Upper Barvas
This portion of pasture land we never got
He said that the rent of the property would require to be increased by  because of this additional bit of pasture land
That was done
The   was placed upon us but the bit of land we did not get
It remained with Lower Barvas which had it originally
No certainly not
They got no abatement of rent either
No they never wanted to get any of our ground
We do not know where we can get more land
We leave that to people wiser in respect to such matters than we are
They are not so well off now
It cannot be with the number of people there
I cannot very well answer the question
I remember that fifty years ago we were clothed with the wool and homemade cloth of our district
Instead of that they have today senseless rags that they buy here and there in other places
Yes it is quite true but they are clothed in their best today
After all what is it worth beside a jacket or a coat of homemade cloth or a pair of trousers of homemade cloth which I saw in my time
The houses are considerably better
I have myself built a poor house in many ways but I have built two houses in my time and it is superior to the house my father had
H my fathers house had been better than it was probably mine would be better than it is
The food is not half so good
I heard one of the previous delegates speak to the same fact on that matter today
I quite approve of that regulation
When there were licensed premises nearer me I was tired enough of them
Yes there was such a day when I used to frequent them but even I gave it up entirely
I do not know
I never took the pledge myself and I am not very sure that I ever regarded that mode of promoting temperance too high
If one who is satisfied in his own mind that it is a proper thing to do so that is my idea of temperance
Nothing
Yes we sell a stirk
Last October I sold two twoyearolds and I am rather ashamed to tell the condition in which they were in the presence of gentlemen
I only got  for the pair of them
Very soon
I must sell Supposing there were only two necessity would compel me to sell one of them
I sell a few sheep now and again
Where there is no good pasture there can be no good mutton
We sell our two or threeyearold wedders from s to s
I have seen s got for them but that is rare
I sell nothing else
In a very good year I once sold four barrels of potatoes but it was an exceptionally good year
My family is now very small they are scattered here and there  but when they were gathered together I would consider  a very moderate allowance for what I had to purchase
Yes and of butter
We have lost the butter entirely of late in comparison with the day I have seen
Yes
I was the father of a family myself before I could distinguish between tea and coffee
The children now can distinguish between the two articles before they are four years of age
They are not at all so innocent in that respect as I was
It was raised
To begin with there was that  of which I have already spoken and then there was s in the time of Munro imposed upon every crofter
For road money and hen money
I cannot very well tell
I remember the time myself when the hens were being delivered and the practice of payment commenced in Munros time
They looked upon it no doubt when it was first imposed upon them as a new imposition but although I myself was without any hen at the time I remember when the old people used to say that they would prefer to pay the shilling rather than deliver the fowl
Yes regularly
Probably there will be two heads of cattle on an average going to the summer pasture from each house and a female always accompanies them but sometimes two neighbours may entrust the care of their cattle to one person
About this time
Six weeks
Yes
The milk comes home every day
The milkman comes home every morning with the milk
From four to six miles distant from the homestead
They sleep outside in the sheilings
I have heard something of that practice but I am not able to give any correct opinion about it
I believe it must have been long ago
They used to sing but itwas not psalms it was not the Psalms of David whatever
They had some metrical composition
I cannot say
No
Very well indeed
Everybody would know him
There was nobody in the whole island like him
I mean his personal appearance
He was a great big fat man
I remember perfectly well of the hens being delivered in his time and I am inclined to believe that the practice continued during the whole time of his factorship
Yes the service was rendered in his time
I cannot remember the men who paid the s but the service was pretty punctually rendered
Yes I both heard and saw vessels of clay being made
All sorts
We have them here yeta good number of them
There is one person here that makes them yet
No
She could not make jars with narrow necks but she would make crocks for butter
I am not aware but as to the woman I speak of some of her work was sent to Edinburgh and gentlemen who came to the place used to hunt her up and get some of the work she did
Yes in the days of my grandfather and greatgrandfather these clay vessels were in most common use
I cannot accurately say but my own belief is that this art was of native growth
The ground officer
To keep the affairs of the township in order
No
When people quarrel or disagree they require to be looked after and that is part of my work
If they differ about marches or anything of that sort it falls within my duty
If we are able to settle the matter among ourselves well and good  if not we must go to the ground officer to have it settled
To the ground officer if the matter affects land or anything of that kind
They go to the factor
Yes they do
I believe they do sometime appeal to the factor also
Sometimes
My decision is now and again reversed by the ground officer but so far as I have been able to gather the practice of the factor when an appeal is made to him against the ground officer is to remit it back to him for further consideration
They consider the factor the superior man
I doubt whether he would
Yes
I dont get the croft for my services
Very little
To tell the truth I used to hear that when a local constable paid his rent he got back s but I never got anything
Yes
Yes
Yes
The previous witness has brought forward the affairs of both the towns North and South
I do not say that the grievances of the two towns are exactly the same but there is one special matter which affects the whole town that has not been brought forward
I am not sure the practice prevaded in the other portion of the township but it prevailed in ours that a certain amount of money was accepted from a man when he was being settled in a croft of new
He paid   before he got it
Yes
I know two men who paid it
They told us in public before all the inhabitants that they did pay it
About five years agonot when the present ground officer was in office
Kenneth Macrae North Shawbost and Colin Macaulay North Shawbost
I dont know to whom one of them paid it but the other man declared that he paid it to the factor
I only repeat what the man said
They were in the place at the time
One was born there
The other man came from the parish of Uig
It was not new land they got it is only when they enter upon possession of a croft
I can say nothing as to that
Ninetythree in both Shawbosts
Of the ninetythree fortyeight are in what is called North Shawbost proper and the rest in New Shawbost
About  I dont know what the township pays
 s is the bare rent
Two cows one stirk twelve sheep no horse
Yes some of them have
There are not near the half of them that have a horse
Yes we have disused the crooked spade
There is not one in the township that uses the caschrom
It is stony rocky ground  some moss some clay
Potatoes barley and oats
Yes
No I never bought any fodder for them
Some years the potatoes keep us going  other years we have very little We had nothing to speak of this year
Yes

s per boll for oatmeal
We use both
Very little
Well there may be some houses where no tea can be found
Some of them may have milk others of them have not a drop of milk
There are very few without land
I know only one who has not some head of cattle
Yes there are some without sheep
They buy them
Where there are families who have sons and daughters able to earn money
Yes they go to the fishing
Very little
We have no proper place for landing
Yes
I cannot say as to that
I dont think it would be very expensive
There are plenty of stones whatever
They woidd not require to quarry a single stone  there are plenty on the ground
Yes it might be of use but there is no question that it would if it was well fastened and of hewn stone
No
They fish for cod and ling
The curers
Yes they buy them now from the curers and get credit till they pay them in fish
In Stornoway but there are one or two local curers
I am unable to tell
s for the ling and d for the cod
Yes
The ling could be had for d twenty years ago
Yes
In the year before last they bought some old boats and they paid them within that year
 feet long with a crew of seven or eight men
Yes
Eels and herring when they get them
On the lines
Yes they are pretty plentiful
No
There was once a sort of quay but the sea washed it away
It was not much worth and it was in a bad place
If a new quay was built it would be built in a different place
Yes there is great need of it and it would be of great service
There is certainly no good safe place for boats
I cannot tell
I hear things but I cannot say what they are unless I am certain
I never heard that
The reclaimed land is of two classes
The greater portion of it was done either at the expense of the proprietor or the Government
There are others again here who have reclaimed a bit of land at their own expense
No except what I may have reclaimed myself
I heard of some that got meal and some that did not
It was the proprietor who gave the meal so far as I am awareat all events it came through his hands
It was very little they got
I am not aware that they paid it back
No
I know that the little I got myself when I was building my house I never paid back
One of them told me he never got a penny
One of the men is my own next door neighbour
He came in upon the place of a man who had run into arrears
He built a new house himself upon that place and the former tenant is there still sitting in the old house on the same property
I dont know whether he had made any arrangement with that tenant
To the factor
He told me it was to the factor
Tho thing occurred five years ago
I dont think he is
Kenneth Macrae
It was the ground officer that actually imposed this sum of money upon that man but he himself says it was for the factor
I used to hear a rumour of that kind but I cannot say for certain that there was any foundation for it
Yes
I am going to speak of the place which the previous witness spoke of
Yes and I agree with it
We were formerly in the old one
There were thirtyone families of us
Now upon a certain day from twenty to thirty families came to us from Uig
To both Old and New Shawbost
Instead of the thirtyone families there are now ninetythree
Yes
We count it as one township
Now the rent of it when the thirtyone had it was  each man paying from  to  The produce of the crofts maintained the families continuously from year to year
They had each from five to eight milk cows
Now we can scarcely be said to have any stock at all
The place we have to rear cattle and sheep for us will not do so any longer
In Munro Mackenzies time he laid out a piece of about seven acres of the arable ground which was reserved for pasture
One of our own people went to ask for this piece of land as a croft for himself but we opposed it and Mr Mackenzie agreed with us and did not give it to him
In Mr Munros time another went to seek for this piece of land but our local constable objected to this arrangement and we again prevailed
Subsequently the present ground officer Mr MArthur placed three men on it without consulting us
We went and prepared a written statement to be sent to the chamberlain and he appeared next day after we prepared this statement and threatened us
He told us we dared not do such a thing
Then again each one of us however small his rent may be pays s or s for this moorland pasture
The same sum is paid by the smallrented crofter as by the one who pays his  croft
The ground does not yield such crops now as it used to do in my earliest recollection  but it is manifest to all meu that those who have the large lots are better off than those who have the very small ones and if they get a proper amount of land just now it would maintain the half of its present population
They are being crowded in upon us from aU parts of the country and we ourselves want to get the land but it is subdivided for the benefit of these
One poor man was sent upon us this year probably not for his own advantage from Sgeirnaloch
The process goes on
Two were sent in upon us last year squatted upon our pasture ground
The house of one of these is built The other is not yet built and our leave is not asked in the matter
There was a man died in my place during my absence and he asked that the third portion of his croft should be given to his son who was married and one of his barns
He had two barns one on each side of the house
The son opened a door into this barn upon the outside wall so that he could enter it without going through his mothers house at the same time
The man went off to the fishing
The ground officer entered the house in the mans absence and the mother was there with her six months old child
She was from home getting the child vaccinated and when she returned she found her fire quenched
She had nothing for it but to weep and wail by the wayside
She was there till others took her in
She got unwell was bedridden and her mother went to attend upon her
She was still going to sleep in the house and they were keeping up a fire in it now and then
In about a month afterwardsI do not know the exact time for I was not at home the ground officer went with three constables and pulled down a portion of the house and she herself and the child have not yet recovered from the exposure
She is still unwell
The widow said that in the process they broke a spinning wheel that was in the house
There is another grievance among the many we have
We were in the habit of placing a herd to look after our sheep and we paid him at the rate of d per head
This year and last year at rent collection we are to pay d per head and between the chamberlain and the ground officer we do not know what it means
If we the people of Shawbost are not oppressed I do not know any in Lewis that have got the same measure dealt out to them
We do not know any relief we can get unless we get land
s or s
A cow a threeyearold a stirk five sheep no horse
There are thirteen families in New Shawbost where I live that have only one cow and some without a cow at all
Yes and my forefathers in Old Shawbost
Yes
Yes
It was a brother of mine who succeeded to my fathers lot
Yes
There are over forty families that did not belong to the place but were brought in
In addition to the ninetythree families paying rent there are some other families in the town as well
Yes
Some have portions of that land and others not
Yes all my croft consists of that land
Yes quite well
They were paid for it partly by Sir James Matheson and partly by Government money and all the people of the place would get work at it and were paid for it
Others camo from other places to work at it
They trenched it
The assistance given during the time they were building the houses depended upon the amount of family they had
For example a man who had three of a family got one stone of meal per week during the time they were building the house and if the family was larger a larger amount of meal in proportion was allowed
The people themselves
Nothing whatever
The people bought it for they had it not
It was provided by themselves
Some of them were well done and some of them otherwise
They are of no service now
They are choked up
We were obliged to open up afresh the upper portion of the ground of late years in order to allow the water to run off because these drains were useless
They have not been reopened but they never worked well
They never drained the ground so well as by the process we use ourselvesthat is gathering the soil together and allowing channels to run between the various patches
It is not so productive as formerly
There is as much straw but less grain
Not a penny
So far as I can judge just now the township yields about  It is certainly over  It was  when it was among the thirtyone people
Yes the widow was to have the twothirds
No it was the custom of the place and he did not speak to the factor
No but it was the common practice of the place that a man would be allowed to subdivide his croft among his sons
He lived in his mothers house before he went to the fishing and then he went and lived in the barn and it was in this barn that the fire was quenched
Some of them do it
I dont think it is right at all that that should be the case but there were other people in our township that were doing such things and they were not found fault with
They were not pleased at his doing so
That was the reason they pulled it down
No only a part of it
He added a bit to one end of it and I believe that was the portion they pulled down
In the same place
He has now got a half of that lot
There is no one now except his mother and a daughter
The greater number of them came from Valtos
One came from Berneray some from Pabbay some from Reef
We are not a year without somebody being forced upon us
There have been thirtythree families sent in upon us altogether and it would appear that the practice is not to cease
We have no less than three this year
Very well
I dont remember
I dont remembernot ever since I got it
I never shall sell any
It never kept me for three months of the year in any one year
 or  worth
Yes I had to buy  worth this year for the three head of cattle I had
This year was exceptional I usually buy about  worth for cattle
Some were complaining but what is the use of complaining when others are sent in
We had the idea among ourselves that this overcrowding in upon us was through spite
Is that not natural enough to suppose when there were over twenty thrown in upon this township and not one thrown in upon a township to the right or to the left
There was not a better township upon this side of the country than ours before it was over crowded as it is and it would be good yet if the pressure of population were relieved
I was alive at the time when there were four small stills in the place and they were smuggling and in addition to maintaining our families by the produce of our crofts we were able to send to those small stills more or less of barley every year when they used to make whisky and sell it for s d a pint of three bottles
When I began to go to the east coast fishing I was among the first who went and then we used to have money through our hands
That would procure necessary supplies all taken from the produce of our crofts
It was productive at that time  there is no question of that
I only meant food
I sell cattle
I both buy and sell cattle
What I meant was that we never sold anything in the way of provisions at all
Yes
I have to say in the first place that we were crowded together by people being thrown in upon us and that that spoiled our township in comparison with what it was in the time of our fathers
Again there are about twice as many paying rent today as there were when I first began to pay rent as a young man
In connection with that I have another statement to make
The people of the township have no land worth calling land
It is stony ground that cannot be worked by horses
I introduced a horse and plough and I had to give them up
They were of no service to me
Then another cause of our discomfort is that we have no high roadno road to the shoreso that we cannot take the seaware from the shore except upon our backs
The second cause of the poverty of the people is that we were deprived of the portion of the ground upon which our cattle used to graze and the rent was left as it was though this was taken away
Not only that but we were obliged to put a fence between us and ourselves so that we by our own action were made to separate ourselves from our own pasture for which we paid rent
We set up a fence between ourselves and that portion that was taken from us which was ours by right
Afterwards instead of ourselves being made to keep up that dyke in repair one shilling a head was laid upon each of us and a man was engaged to keep the dyke up
The man that marches upon the other side has the use of that dyke but still we are not aware that he pays a shilling
I have another thing to complain of which neither myself in my younger days nor my father nor my grandfather had reason to complain of
Our moorland pasture in those times was held in connection with the township
This moorland pasture which was ours we have now to pay a separate rent for and I will tell you how this came about
As a young man I got land
We were paying a weeks service upon roads to the proprietor and we were told that s instead of this weeks service was laid upon us as an addition to the rentthat we would have to pay road money no longer
Now there are not very many people old enough now living to testify to it but my father used to tell me that there was a shilling levied of hen money along with the rent and packet money and it was unjust to lay upon us these burdens
I did not pay any of them when I got land first
We complain very much of that
Now there is another matter in connection with that
I myself was at the east coast fishing and when I was there the groundofficer came and in my absence compelled my wife to gather the cattle
I was not a shilling in arrears at the time
He took away the best head of cattle I had for which I could get some  He valued it at  s and  was all I got for it
Its hide would be of as much service to me
Off and on about twenty years ago  I cannot give the date
Unless they are relieved in some way and some opportunity or advantage is given to them I am quite unable to see how the people of our township can improve their condition so that they will not be as they are virtually beggars living upon the charity of the people of the south
There are some of the people who have no stock to speak of that is worth calling stockperhaps only one cow
I think that is easily explained
It is upon the contributions of the people of the south that they are living up till now
I have this year in view for it was quite difficult for me to see how the people could live through this year except for the relief which they received
Very little
Perhaps they might be able to sell a head of cattle two sheep or thereabouts
At Stornoway and to drovers that come
According to the state of the market the best of the head of cattle that we would sell would average perhaps about  or  and the worst  s or  that is for a fouryear old
Yes we sell them younger
We have so very few to sell
Some of them do that
Some of them sell them at three years old and some at two years old
At five or six years
It is not at its full growth till it is four or five  the pasture is so poor
We get a higher price for it
Just up and down as it is todaysome years better and some years worse
Yes perhaps that may be the case but I have seen years at that time when the price was higher than it is today
A shepherd beside us
It is as though you just cut up the half of a seat into two and added the other half of the seat to his share and we shoved into a corner
Yes he is virtually a tacksman
Every one who is a tacksman we call a shepherd
The present tacksman is Mr Sinclair of Dallbeg
It was to his predecessor that it was first given when we lost it
John Mackenzie
He was groundofficer at the time
 or  years ago
It was the best part of the township for cattle and we were of opinion that it could keep about the third part of the cattle of the township
No
Yes he had Dallbeg and Dallmore before this was added to him
The best hill we had for our cattle was taken from us
It was on that very hill that we used to have the greatest portion of our cattle
Then whenever he got it he began to pound our cattle if they strayed there
He used to keep them in that pound for two or three days and then when we took the sheep out their stomachs were very empty and we had to send them away to the hill again where we never saw anything further than their skins
From Dallbeg and Dallmore the two farms which this man got
About the same time
There is very little of that kind of good ground on this side of the country
We must work it with spades because of the stony character of the soil
There would be over  in Dallmore
In Dallbeg there were five of whom the groundofficer who possessed the greater portion of the place was one
That was the case
I myself along with one of my own age when we heard the place was to be cleared to Shawbost offered to the factor to give as much rent as he would get from any other person if he would give us the place for ourselves and that we would associate the other people along with us and would pay the rent twice a year
We did not ask that any one would be made responsible for the rent except us two
We did not get it
Mr Munro Mackenzie
Fivetwo from Dallbeg and three from Dallmore
Our towuship could not contain them all
They were sent to America and to other places after they had but recently erected new buildings
Their fires were quenched
Had you seen it you could scarcely bear the sight
Their houses were broken down and their fires were quenched
Yes and Dallmore too and a capital place for crofters
No it is not suitable for a fishing place
No they did not require to fish at that time they were otherwise comfortable
Thomas Macdonald
If I had been at home there would have been something to say before he got it
What would be the use
I would not be listened to
Because it was held I had more than my proper ramming
No so long as the rent was properly paid that was no business of the landlords
If anybody had a grievance in the matter it was my neighbours and not he
It was in Mr Knoxs time
The practice in his time was that if I paid more than the rent he kept it and if I paid a sum short of the rent he did not make much noise about it  but if he got the money he kept it to himself
That was the beginning of these continual impositions
Yes he was
He was factor under Seaforth  not under Sir James
When this portion of land was taken from us and added to the farm of Dallbeg we were taken bound to build half the fence between us and the tacksman of Dallbeg was to build the other half
Our grievance is that it was then stated we were not keeping up our own half of the fence properly and this shilling was imposed upon us to be given to a man who would do so
The same condition was not imposed upon him
He still is allowed to maintain his own half
I was not aware of the arrangement until I was made to pay it at the rent collection
South Shawbost where I reside myself
That is land newly taken in
The people did the work and they got more or less of meal for their work
We believe it was at the proprietors expense
We got also money if it was due us if we did not draw our wages all in meal
I can say nothing about that
Oh they dont touch them
Then there is another matter
It is impossible for us to bear the amount of taxation that is imposed upon us
When I got my lot at first the rent was    Is
My rent just now taxes included is  s d
From the receipt the bare rent is  s and the taxes are  s d but s d of that is shepherd money
There is s d for school rate and I have no child of school age
Another matter I want to lay before you
Whereas my father and grandfather lived upon milk and butter and flesh and meal I live upon meal hot water and sugar
My father had a croft of  and such was the produce of it that not only did we not buy anything but we were scarcely able to consume the produce at that time
There is another thing which I must mention which vexes my soul
In the Naval Reserve there are  or  Lewis young men and not a tacksmans son is among them so far as I am aware
Think of it now
Take upon the one side these tacksmen with their sheep and on the other side the young men I could produce and which would be best to maintain the strength of the country
I am not aware there are any from this island
They dont require to go
They are well enough at home
They have the best portion of the island
I am not aware there are any
Yes I myself spoke to him about it
Yes a road could be made
The factor told me that if the people were to say it was necessary to make a road he would not oppose it but things remained as they were
I heard it all and I know it well
I know it well but the question was not asked at me
In my grandfathers time they used actually to go with a pair of fowls to the castle
I cannot say about eggs but there was a pair of fowls
They set apart a day every year to repair it
No not during the year but of course some gaps might have got into it since we repaired it
There are gaps upon his own side of the fence as well as upon ours
The best plan would be to give us our own ground which our fathers had and for which we still pay rent
They got portions of our own lots
The ground did not need to be prepared
No nothing
He gave them the ground of those who feU into arrears and lost their places
Thirty or thirtytwo or thirtythree years ago
Yes I think so
It was during Sir James Mathesons time when Mackenzie was ground officer
It was Mackenzie also
I cannot say
I have four cows two stirks about fifteen sheep and a horse
 s
About
I am not aware there were any
Yes it is the natural increase of the place except the five I have named
Not any at all in our place but one park  I cannot say now many acres
Yes
I am quite certain that the land was better when I was a young man
The old land that was cultivated by our fathers has got exhausted
No our township is not in this parish at all
We belong to the parish of Lochs
My remedy is the remedy that every seiious man would propose if he would only speak outthat is to give the land to the people at a reasonable ventthe land that is now waste
It was ours by right
God gave it to the children of men and our right is better than the tackmans
Yes there is another place called Lamishader which is joined to the tack of Linshader
There were a few crofters comfortable there once
On the north side of Loch Carloway between the township and the sea
Yes in our district
I was a fisherman but not now
We as crofters of the township or village of Kirvig beg to request the old boundaries of our village and parish be restored or changed to its former place
We also beg to state that at the time when Sir James Matheson became proprietor of Lewis our village was divided into seven  crofts and that at that time those seven crofts were made into ten  thereby rendering the crofts quite inadequate for the subsistence of the families living on them and that those crofts have been further divided into fifteen  and that there are in the village five   squatters or families without land who are a burden on their parents and on the rest of the crofters in the village besides a lot which is let in the pasturage of the village see Appendix A
XLI
There are in the village a large number of young men married and single all of them fishermen and naval reserve men who are compelled to be a burden on their parents because they cannot obtain land to cultivate or even a site for a house
There is for instance one married man who built a miserable bothy on his fathers lot and he had no sooner done so than his father was intimated by the factor that if his son remained on his lot he the father would be forthwith evicted
This is but one instance out of very many and this is all caused by the factor hemming in the people on all sides to make room for sheep farms as for example there is in our vicinity an aged bedridden bachelor who rents a sheep farm which would hold comfortably from  to  crofters
They all grew up in the place
It was against the rules of the estate
That the land should be given to the sons of men which was owned by their fathers and for which their ancestors shed their blood
We are close to the boundary between Uig and Carloway
No there is no tack near us
We want the boundaries to be restored as they were in the times of our fathers and grandfathers which were altered under the factorship of Mr Mackenzie
Yes
It was formerly part of the tack of Mr Kenneth Smith and when people were removed from Mangersta it was given to them
At a meeting of the crofters of Carloway on the st ult it was agreed to lay the following statement of their grievances before the Royal Commission
Our principal grievance is overcrowding and curtailment of holdings without corresponding reduction of rent
Thirtyone years ago there were only twentyfour crofters in our township paying an aggregate rental of  There are today sixty families exclusive of paupers
Since the year  or thereabout our holdings have been considerably curtailed by the gradual formation of new lots out of our common or outrun
At present the number of such new lots amounts to IS paying a rental of  Though so many new lots have been formed out of our common and the cattle of the holders of these new lots allowed to graze on our pasture laud no reduction whatever has been made on our rent
The holders of these new lots came for the most part from districts that were cleared in order to make room for sheep farms
Our pasture land is very much damaged by another township cutting peats on it
The estate compelled us to work  days at making a road to enable the people of the township referred to to reach their own peatground and after all they are allowed to cut their peats on our pasture land
For the last thirty years we have been compelled by the estate to send aU our grain to be ground at Breasclete mill six miles distant
We had two mills of our own at Carloway but the estate ordered them to be destroyed
We in common with the people of the surrounding townships of Borrowston Knock and Garinin who also send their grain to Breasclete mill are thus deprived of about the eighth part of our grain between mill dues and our own trouble and expense in going to Breasclete
The extent of our holdings including cultivable land and pasture land is scarcely two miles long and one mile wide
In  the population of our township was  On account of the small size of our lots we crop the whole of them every year though we are well aware that such perpetual cropping is calculated to render the soil less productive
The yield of grain from our crofts is not sufficient to supply our families with food
Generally we require to buy on an average ten bolls of meal while this year we need about eighteen bolls on an average
Our comforts and chances of livelihood as crofters could easily and conveniently be secured by annexing Dalmore to our present small holdings
Dalmore was at one time inhabited by fourteen families all of whom were removed and the place given to a tacksman
As Dalmore is contiguous to our township we would be prepared any time to give for it the same rent that the present tenant gives for it
It is joined to Dallbeg under one tacksmanJohn Sinclair
Yes
No
Querns are still used in some of our houses
If we did not do so we could not live
Nothing more
The old mills ground our meal as well and much better than the new one
I have to speak of the trouble we have in respect of the mill
We are more than six miles from the mill here
We have to give the miller every year the onesixteenth part of our grain besides our trouble and if we have only three pecks we have that same trouble to undergotwelve miles to travel
We had old mills of our own which we used formerly and we think it a hardship that we should be obliged to keep up this mill while we are also obliged to buy meal for our support elsewhere
The old mills are forbidden entirely
That is under article  of regulations
We think if we were allowed to resume the use of our own old mills as we did before it would be a relief to us
At a meeting of the crofters of Borrowston on the st May last it was agreed that the following statement of their grievances and demands be presented through their delegates to the Royal Commission
Our first grievance is the smallness of our holdings
Fiftyfive years ago there were only five crofters in Borrowston paying an aggregate rent of  At present there are fifteen crofters paying a rental of   see Appendix A
XLI
We hold on an average about three acres of cultivable land
Our common or outrun is about  mile long and  mile wide
The population of our township is ninetytwo souls
We cultivate minutely from year to year the whole of our lots and in consequence of this perpetual tillage the soil of our crofts is graduaUy deteriorating
The quantity of grain which we raise off our crofts does not suffice any year to support our families
W require to buy of meal in ordinary years about   worth on an average over and above what we raise off our own lots
We require to buy about   worth of meal on an average this year there being only three families in our township that require less than   while there are others that need   worth of meal
Our people are strong active and industrious and thoroughly capable to earn a respectable and independent livelihood for themselves and the families they represent provided only they had plenty of land to work upon
Bordering on our township is a promontory called Leimshadder which would be a good and convenient supplement to our present small holdings
Leimshadder the place referred to was at one time inhabited by eight crofters but these were removed and the place given to a tacksman
About twentyseven years ago we offered a rental of   for Leimshadder promising to pay the rent before entering into possession but our offer was refused though the place was afterwards given to a tacksman for a rental considerably less than what we offered
Four or five years ago it was let to its present holder who has large possessions of land elsewhere in the island
We are still willing to take Leimshadder at a reasonable rent
Another serious grievance which we wish to state is the extreme difficulty and hardship we experience in connection with our peats
The peat moss connected with our own township was exhausted upwards of twenty years ago
The estate then gave us permission to cut peats on convenient ground belonging to another township but on the authority of the groundofficer this peat ground was taken from us two years ago
We were then driven out to the moor outside the township of Carloway
Our peat banks are now  miles distant from our homes
For half this distance there is no road though we have to carry all our peats on our back
We have further to cross a river which being without a bridge is after heavy rains often dangerous and impassable
Our peats being so far away from us and to relieve ourselves somewhat of the hardship of carrying them the whole way on our backs we sometimes have recourse to the expedient of floating them on the river for a certain distance but as the river is let by the estate for fishing purposes we are not allowed to float our peats on it till the beginning of January
We could get a supply of peats for twenty years or more in Leimshadder within a short distance of our homesMURDO MLEOD
About four miles from this
I have to say that we cannot live with so little land as we have and that we are much inconvenienced by the distance we are from our peats
About the tack of Linshader which bounds with us I have to say there is no resident tenant there and that the herd from there goes through our township with his cattle back and forward
Mr Mackenzie
Our weak sheep are harrassed by his passing back and forward
He is a herd and drives both cattle and sheep through our ground
We are not allowed to cross the dyke between us and his farm if we want to go for seaware or anything
No
We cannot get any more than about a dozen creels every year on the shore of our own land
No we must not cross the dyke
It would
Donald Mlver who wrote the paper we have given in has himself told me that he paid money and that the sum charged for the liberty of collecting whelks was 
I cannot say exactlya dozen years at any rate
Yes
No
I used to collect whelks but I paid nothing for the liberty of doing so
I sold them to Mlver before mentioned and he was charged that tax as a licence for taking them
We had nothing to pay
We were allowed to sell them only to the men who paid the duty for the privilege
Yes
It is still maintained
There is another man this year buying the whelks a man named Neil Mackay used to buy them
Not upon the arable ground but upon grass
Their lots were cut out of our grass
No they did it themselves
Nothing
Some lots were cut out where we had our peat ground and we were obliged to go elsewhere for our peats and our peats are now nearly exhausted
I never knew that he spent a penny upon it
Our grazing was taken from us and we were then obliged to build a dyke between ourselves aud the pasture that we have
A cow must go three miles before she can bend her head
No
We complained once or twice to the factor to restore the grass that was our own and I believe he was minded at one time to do so but the thing fell out that it was joined to another bit of land which was the best of the place and made into a small tack occupied by Mr Macrae
I dont know
When the grazing was taken from us we were asked to value it before the chamberlain
He told us that we would either get the grazing or a reduction according to the value of it from our rent which we valued at  but we have not got either
We would indeed be very glad to do so
I had ten hoggs this year and I lost them all for want of grass
Yes
The Callernish Crofters complain of being deprived of two points of their ground namely Orosay and Aird since a long time and still paying rent for it as also muir and pasture in common given it to Carloway people
Twentyeight crofts taken from us and others put on them some from Garrynahine and some from Uig and still the rent rising
Nothing but dykes on every side of us
The crofters must keep the half of them up or else the factor will take money from them at rent time for it
This townships former rent was   now its  A few years ago paid for liberty of collecting whelks and sending them to market south  rent
We are living yet at Callernish that can testify on oath with clear conscience that our eyes saw this taken from us if we are wanted to do this
Yes they gather all they can
They think them little enough
I have not been asked to pay rent myself but I have heard others say they have and I think some of them are perhaps here
About sixty
We have nothing else to live upon here except the help that some of our young people give that go fishing
I barely remember when Aird was taken from them
Yes
Yes
Orosay was taken from us some little time before that
Twentyone years ago
I dont know
It is now a part of the land of the innkeeper and another part of it is a park occupied by the doctor
For a long time
Yes
We have no pasture at all only the ground that we till
Our cow must go three miles before she can bend her head to grass
It is in the hands of Mr Macrae
I have to say further that there was no reduction of our rent when the Aird was taken from as
There was no reduction of our rent when the Reef people was sent in upon us and the Aird was taken from us
There are some of us of whom I am one who have within the last thirty years when we got these new lands taken in and reclaimed new ground which we have done our best to make productive but we have no grass
Yes
Yes a verbal statement
We the people of Dun of Carloway were in a township at the other end of the parish of Uig called Mangersta
Now a shepherd lives there
Our ancestors were there for  years
It was as good land as was in the whole countryside but the sea destroyed their crofts now and again
No tacksman in the country would have cows and sheep better than ours or that would secure higher prices at market
We were thus enabled to keep ourselves going from year to year without falling into any debt whatever
In one year in particular our crofts were destroyed by the sea and we asked the Rev
Mr Campbell the Free Church minister of Uig to speak to Sir James Matheson in order to get an exchange from Mangersta where we were to Dun of Carloway where we now are
This township of Dun of Carloway was for the space of nineteen years before that under sheep
A tacksman gave up the place that year
The proprietor had brought in five parks before that time above the dwellinghouses right across the township
There was a slated house a barn and a byre built there
When we went to arrange with Mr Munro the chamberlain about an exchange of township this matter of the parks and the steading stood in the way of our being able to agree
We returned to Mangersta a distance of thirty miles on foot without coming to terms
Then we were asked to go to Stornoway
We went to Stornoway and agreed there and Mr Mackay our present chamberlain was witness of our agreement
He gave us the township as it was held by the previous tenant with the exception of four out of five of the parks and the steadingthat is the slated house the byre and the barn
We were afraid that people might come and occupy these parks and that to our injury and because we knew what set of people the shepherds were long beforewhat a bad set they werewe were afraid of them
He promised to us that these parks and that steading would not stand in our way in any way whatever and that he would fence them round so that what was within the fence would be within and what would be without the fence would be without
There were two men sent from Garanahine who got one of these parks to each man
The fence was never set up
It has not been put up to this day
These two men began to pasture their stock upon our grazings for which we paid rent
Mr Munro the chamberlain gave us a written agreement
When these two men from Garanahine began to encroach upon us with their cattle we went to the chamberlain
The first thing ho asked us was to produce the written agreement
Well the agreement was sent for and produced
He read the paper to us Mangersta people and the two Garanahine people as well
When he read the paper he told those two men that they had nothing to get except those two parks
The two men said that if they got nothing but that they might as well go away
Mr Munro told them that was the agreement and if they were not pleased with it to go
He put the agreement into his pocket and we have not seen it since
We came eleven years ago and this occurred about eight years ago
The end of it is that these two men with all their stock are still a burden upon us and upon our grazings with the authority of the proprietor
Our land pasture up to one hundred sheep in winter and they have reduced to such an extent that no one can believe what a state of poverty we have been brought into
About 
If you include these two Garanahine men of whom I have spoken
The crofters pay about  exclusive of these two men
They pay  between them
The ground officer has the rest the house and steading and two of the parks but I dont know how much he pays
The ground officer has not injured us in any way
Yes
A park each
About six acres
They are the same except that they have money
One of them has over forty sheep and the other has nearly forty sheep
They have each one horse and each have six or seven heads of cattle
That is our complaint
Our complaint is twofold
We consider they have no right to put any stock there and at any rate they have too much stock there
We think our own stock could overstock it
Twentyone are on the rent roll
There is one upon which there are four families and there are two subdividedunder twentyone families
A full croft
Judging by the size of these parks which are said to contain six acres my croft would be about three years
I have no sheep at all
I have one cow and two young ones I have no horse
The summing would be three milk cows three stirks and fifteen sheep
Yes but there is some of them who pay  of rent
 of bare rent is my own croft for which that is the summing
The excellent sheep which I had In Mangersta nineteen in number I brought there and they all died on that ground
I have not been able to buy any since that time
We have twice sent a petition to Stornoway
I could not exactly say what answer we got but we did not get the pasture
This is the only complaint for which I was sent here
I have to say that there are very many people upon our places
There are twentyseven crofters there today
I dont see how they can live at all
It is sufficiently plain that they cannot live by the fishing and that they cannot live by the amount of land they have
Twentysix or twentyseven
Yes but excluding the ground officer
There are not any without more or less of land but there are some on the land not on the rent roll
Not a penny
Yes and it was a difficult task
Nothing whatever since we came there
He built fences round the parks of the ground officer but none round us
The dykes were built before we came
We built houses as well as we could
We know the regulations of the estate on that matter and we built the houses as well as we were able
These regulations were read to us four years ago and since that time we have improved our dwellinghouses to some extent
Yes
A good many of the inhabitants were present
I do not intend to say much
The substance of what I have to say on behalf of the people is that there is plenty of land under sheep and deer which might make them comfortable
I have seen the people reduced to such poverty that they were obliged to feed themselves upon dulse from the shore and a drink of hot milk after it which if they had not of their own they got from their neighbours
I do not refer to this present year as yet but I have seen that in years not long back
I see them now reduced to such a hard condition that I can compare them to nothing but the lepers at the gate of Samariadeath before them and death behind them
I see no prospect of improvement of their condition
If one tack is set free another tacksman comes into it to confront the people as the Philistines did who came out to battle with the people of Israel
It astonishes me to see that the proprietor takes any pleasure in the condition of the hornless sheep compared with that of men  and I see nothing for it now but that the sheep and the deer should be sent away or the people be sent away out of the kingdom
The old people cannot be sent away without the young people
It is only the young people who can go and it is only they who support the old people
If the young people go the old people will die and it is hard for them to see the sheep and the deer enjoying the price of their fathers blood
I have not much more to say
They certainly could not
Sell it to the drovers
If they got good land on which they could work to advantage the produce of their land would enable them to purchase stock
It is not and cannot be
One of the sheep of the tacksmen is worth three of our sheep
If we got their land our stock would be better
The stock that we have would improve when it got the chance
Yes when they got hornless rams they would become cross in time
We could
Last spring I began to waken up stones to erect a new house but my son said he was going to the States which put a stop to my proceedings
I did at one time but they have become too poor now
I used to go working throughout the Lewis and Harris and also to the east coast fishing but I have ceased to do so now
Since I married I have spent  on meal
I had such a mind that it was not the same price I charged everybody
The Scripture says  Rob not the poor man because he is poor and I endeavoured to act upon that
For the gable and the dwelling part of the house  feet in length I charge  and I feed myself
Themselves
It would cost according as the stones were convenient or not
Yes
I do not know what they cost
I built only one house there
To build a house of  feet in length would cost including the quarrying of the stones not less than 
It is the whole walls of the house
I do not know what the wood would cost from Stornoway  but drift wood comes ashore here sometimes which is roofing and if it were abundant the wood would not cost nearly so much as it otherwise would
I cannot say but it may have been given to the people that asked for it
I do not know
From s d to s
Fiftysix I believe
Twentynine
Yes
It came from the multiplying of the people  and perhaps a man whose rent was  had the sum spread over three families
I believe that if we had had English teachers instead of Gaelic teachers which was all we used to have probably I myself would not have been where I am and others besides me
We have but the people are not satisfied with the school
It is only up to the age of fourteen that their parents are obliged to keep them at school and they cannot give them any more schooling after that or send them to college
Yes as much at any rate as would enable him to make his way through the world
He thinks so himself
I believe he would have gone before now but for his affection for his parents whose only support he is
Yes for ought I know fortune might so far befriend him but death might come upon him also
I know the whole of this parish
I have walked over it more than once
I do not know if it would be improper for me to say it but as the Queen of Sheba said when she came to visit Solomon that all she had heard was nothing to what she had seen so would any one say who had walked over the land of this parish and seen how much of it is under sheep and deer
Twenty
Yes
Yes and more
I am certain of it for there were no poor in the parish thirtyfive years ago
The poor were then three times as well off as they are now
Certainly and it would be easy to pay reasonble rent compared with the amount of money we spend on meal
I said they could not buy stock
They could pay the rent by the money they make at the lobster fishing long line fishing and east coast fishing
I understand that quite well but when they would get good land it would bring forth crop for them and though they should be behind for two years they would afterwards make up for it when it produced good crops so that two rents could be easier then to pay than one at the beginning
They could not work any harder than they are doing at present
I believe they would be all right then if a year such as this last one would not come upon them
I do not know anything else that would so improve the condition of the people as to give them plenty of land
It is a hardship to them because they have no profit out of the ground at present
However little a bit of land a man may have he must attend to it and work it just the same as it were a larger and better croft
Some years it is profitable other years it is not
I sometimes fish myself
I do not fish now my son fishes
Yes some of them have gone away already to Shetland
There are only two boats this year belonging to the place but some of them fish in boats belonging to Loch Carloway
Some of them are their own and some of them belong to the fishcurers
Only two boats belong exclusively to the Tolsta people
Yes they have to do with the fishcurers
Most of them are employed in boats belonging to the fishcurers
There are sixteen men who in company have these two boats of their own
These two boats belong to the fishcurers as well as the other ones
What I mean is that these two boats are kept at Tolsta
There are five men who own a boat of their own
I did
I believe so
I do not know what the measure of the land is respectively but I know from walking over itat least it is my beliefthat there is more of the land under sheep and deer than under the possession of crofters
I cannot say
I did not hear the figures mentioned by the factor
I am not going to say anything against that what has been measured nobody can contradict
Uig
The land that is under sheep and deer is like food with kitchen and the land that the crofters have is like food without kitchen
There were deer before there was any tack in the parish
The grass would keep up the deer it is not the people that would
Sheep and cattle in summer
They were kept there before
When I was young we had only Gaelic in the school at Tolsta but we had an English school after that from the Free Church Ladies Association
I would not by any means but I wish that the English should be taught and they would learn the Gaelic along with it
There is a Sabbath school in which they are taught Gaelic
Yes the church is near them
I think so
I speak for the island of Lewis as well
Yes
 Love your neighbour as yourself
Just as well
Yes
In answer to the questions that are required we the tenants have to say that the rent of our town when Sir James Matheson came to the estate was  the number of tenants at that time being thirty families and it has increased to fortyfour families and the rent arose to   of which five lots were cut out of the grazing pasture which our village had and was rented besides the former sum these five are of the fortyfour above mentioned and besides that another piece of arable land and grazing was taken from us which was valued at  and that is turned on the rest of the town
And besides that there is twentyfive having no lots but squatters among the rest
This is the fourth chamberlain since Sir James Matheson came to the estate the second one of them namely John Munro Mackenzie was taking from them their cattle for the rent between  and  which would get at this time between  and  and that was reducing the mind and stock of the people
Almost every one in the place
A native of the place
About thirty years ago when the place was lotted out
In my first recollection there were only thirty families but when the people were thrown in upon them they increased
People all got poor after that and they were huddled together and it was at that time thirty years ago when the place was lotted out that the rent was raised
No it is exclusive of taxes
Men that were thrown in upon us
They came out of the place
No
It is in this very town beside the mill
It was cut off our township when the place was lotted out but our rents were not reduced when we were deprived of that piece of ground
The miller has it
We do not know
We got no abatement anyhow
Yes that is the case
No
No nothing whatever
Some have and some have not
From their own relatives they do
To get land
Where it is
It is lying waste the best part of the land throughout this island under sheep and deer and the poor people kept in the worst parts of it where they cannot make a livelihood out of it and the best parts taken from them at every corner
They can scarcely be able to live at all
Yes they have relatives in the township
Yes and road money
Yes that is the case
These twentyfive people must be kept up
Must not one poor family support another when there is no other way for it
Perhaps about six
These were very bad years like this year
The markets were low and when there was no other way for it the cow had to be sold though it would only fetch s or s and BO the factor took them away and he himself priced them
He sold them as he was able to do it
I am not aware of any unless perhaps as the previous delegate stated some Government meal was given away for assistance
I myself got a little meal
Some in the township got some and others did not
Yes the greater part of them
I could except very few here not equally in need of it
It is quite impossible to get any person in the world who can satisfy every person
I got half a bushel
I have not paid for it and I do not know whether I shall be called upon to pay for it or not
s bare rent My brother pays s also
There is road money and poor money and moorland pasture money in addition to that
Five shillings
Away out of here
In my first recollection we did not pay for that moorland at all
It was in Mr Munros time that we commenced to pay itoff and on perhaps about ten years ago
Two cows a stirk now and again six or seven sheepsometimes perhaps only four no horse
Though we keep two cows what is the use of that
The one only eats up the other
Yes otherwise we could not keep them living
Any poor person here and there who may not have stock of his own may have it to sell
From s to   
Yes considering the nature of the soil which is very bad
We ourselves could not keep one cow for all that grows out of the ground
I would take onethird off

Three or four cows and young beasts and about twelve sheep
Yes and of scarcity of land as well
If they cannot get fodder they must buy food for them
They buy some stuff from the millmealdust
Sometimes we give them meal and when we are not able to buy anything at all for them then they and we must want
It comes off everything we grind
Yes it is only onethird of that mealdust that comes to us
Three shares go to the miller himself
I only send a boll of oats and a boll of barley to the mill every year
Yes
They carry us through the winter along with other things in a good year
We bade farewell to them this year at the time of lifting them
No
Meal from Stornoway
Some porridge and some more or less of bread just as it comes
Every one that can
The one that can have tea will have it
There is no milk
Bread
Those who fish may have mow or less of fish
There are three large boats fishing out of the township
One
There are four fishing this year
Eight
Three of them belong to Mr Smith fishcurer Stornoway and the fourth belongs to a native of the place
The boats are his and they give him the fish
He gives them so much per lingtenpence or a shilling
A cod counts half a lingfivepence or sixpence
The fishermen themselves
Yes
At Martinmas but he supplies them with meal when they are working
Sometimes they do and sometimes not
No there has been no settlement yet but he is providing them with meal meanwhile
I cannot say  I never worked for him
Eighteen shillings to  per boll
It would not be proper that I should ask it for nothing
No
Yes if we could get it without any difficulty about it
If they got more land and if for the term of two years they got assistance which they themselves might pay back afterwards by instalments they could manage
If they got more land to work it would be of the utmost service to them
They would be able to get increased stock as well as more produce
Yes
It is a kind of a road we made it ourselves
It is not what I call a good road
I cannot say for certain unless the assistance we got this year can be held as a contribution towards it
The greater part of the work upon the road was done this year
No no money wages as yet
No as many march fences as are set up were built by ourselves
In some cases there are three married couples in the same house
They mutually assist each other
Not the majority but some of them are
Yes
Yes it is there we grind all the oats we have
Yes oats will grow
It depends on the soil in which they are sometimes they yield an average crop
Some of the ground in this district also though it may grow oats will yield no fruit but in others it is different
It depends en the soil in which they are
Yes most of them do
Yes
I have been elected by the crofters of Breasclete Park as their delegate and the following is the statement I have to make on their behalf
We are now thirtythree years in Breasclete Park
We were formerly in Reef where we were born and brought up as also our fathers and grandfathers
The land there was good and was quite convenient to the sea for fishing and therefore we lived pretty comfortable
A stranger who wished a sheep farm then fixed upon Reef as a suitable place for that purpose
The result was that we got notice of removal from Mr Scobie the then factor
We had no arrears of rent and therefore we refused in a body to do this and stood out against it for three years when Mr Scobies term of office expired
We then naturally expected justice from the next factor  but on the contrary he took up at once the work his predecessor had begun and at last got us forcibly ejected
Four families of whom my father was one came to our present holding and some of the rest had to go to America
When we came here there were no stones to be got for building a house and as we had to turn our attention at once to the working of the land which was nothing but a peat moss we had to make temporary huts at the seashore to shelter us until we got houses made of turf on our lots
I myself remember all this perfectly well
About fourteen acres were allotted to the four families and as the land was so very bad we got the island of Kiva for grazing at a rent of  This was our best help at that time and we held it for five years until the late factor Mr Munro came in when it was taken from us
There are now nine families on the same amount of land a was originally allowed to four
Further we have reason to complain of the annual increase of the rates which has now reached to not less then s in the  the rights of which we cannot well understand  in short when we came to our present holdings the rent was only  s and owing to the overcrowding and increase of rents and taxes it has come to  s d sterling
We want more lands with fair rents fixity of tenure with compensation for improvements and we hope the Government will see their way to help us to stock our lands and build houses which we are all willing to pay with interest through course of time and humbly hope Her Majestys Government will be pleased to grant us our humble requestNEIL MLENNAN Delegate
Six
Yes
The rent is  s
From two to four cows each
Some of them have no sheep some as high as twelve perhaps some few over twelve
Yes the cows have their followersyoung beasts as well
No reason whatever except to order us out of it
The innkeeper at Callernish
No
Yes
Yes
Very little
If it was kept without stock during the summer it would winter about eighteen cows
Yes the soil was better
There was more rock there than here but the soil was different here it is peat moss and there it was sand and good soil
I believe we had more and they would be better but I believe when Reef was cleared there were too many people there at the time
Some of them went to Ness some to Borv and some to Lochganvich on this side of Stornoway
Those that went to Lochganvich had afterwards to go to America
There would be about thirtyone or thirtytwo families
Four came here and the rest went elsewhere
Just refusing to go
Yes
The sheriff officers were in the habit of leaving the summons in the keyhole
The people just disregarded them
There were no police sent there
Yes there was no violence
So far as my own recollection goes and the testimony of the only old man now living who came from there at that time there were works going onroads and so onunder Government and it was by these works that they were in the habit of providing for their families and paying their rents
So when they were turned out in this way and refusing to leave the place each foreman having charge of the works got notice that no work was to be given to the people of this place
They then fell into arrears of rent when they did not get work and so when this additional hold was got on them go they must because the rent was not paid
Some of them were poor enough
The years in which they were sent away were very bad years
One of the men who was sent from there to Lochganvich and afterwards was sent to America was uuwilling to emigrate
The officers came to his house and quenched his fires and sent him out of the house to the steamer that was waiting to carry him away and his only cow was left at the back of the door and he got nothing for it
His brother afterwards sold the cow and sent the proceeds to him
District roads
It was the proprietor who paid the expense of these roads
There was a little Government help and Government meal at the same time
I cannot tell
Not under the proprietor
There was fishing going on
No
I cannot tell how many
The whole population was getting work that is all those who applied got work and paid their rents
No
Nothing on this side of the country except the fishing
I cannot tell
Yes a large number of years ago
All our young people were there unless there was one who was from home
A lad belonging to the place
I supplied the material myself a lad belonging to the place who lives in Stornoway composed it and a lad who lives hero copied it
The native of the place who lives at Stornoway and who composed the rest of tho paper composed the last paragraph and it is in his handwriting
Yes
Yes
A lad of twenty one of ourselves
He writes a good hand but does not know English much
It was waste landpeat mosses which belonged to the people of the district
Sir James Matheson the proprietor had meanwhile trenched it somewhat and turned the ground
Not a penny
Those of us who came here brought the roofs of the houses with us
Others left these things there and they went useless
No nothing
No nothing except what was done before we came
They themselves say no
Yes they got a share
They themselves said they got no reduction whatever
 It is a piece of land that never was cultivated before and that I trenched and I believe I have it cheaper in consequence
There is no new lot besides mine and I believe my neighbours pay 
One pays  s d of bare rent and another  s
The regulations of the proprietor was to have oue cow with its followers and four sheep
Three cows one or two young beasts and three or four sheep perhaps
No there is no horse upon that lot
Yes there are three horses in the place among the six people
We get some of it upon that island we had ourselves long ago and some on another island
No
No
Yes they have improved their houses
We would be quite satisfied with them so far as the bouses are concerned if there was sufficient land to maintain ourselves in connection with them
I sold one last year at the autumn market
About  It was a three yearsold
I will be obliged to sell one this year in order to provide food for my family unless I find some other means of maintenance
Although I should sell all I have I would not get out of debt
Yes that is the only thing
I buy something every year to feed them in winter
Some years I expend 
Five head of sheepthree sheep and two lambs
No I never sell a sheep
The ground is bad and the young ones die in winter unless they are handfed
John
Mr Mackenzie who succeeded Mr Scobie
Yes
At Lochganvich five miles along the road between here and Stornoway
Angus Maclean
I knew the man but I was not present when the thing was done
I am not aware that he expended a penny since we were settled there
There is not one of us who has stock in the place but is obliged to buy provender for them
There are some in the place who have no stock at all and we can get fodder from them
From   to  every year
Yes
Somewhat good but only accessible from the middle of spring and during the summer months
No
We have a sort of breastwork which the fishcurer set up where we can laud when the tide is in
Yes
Yes
Very good boats
From the curers
None of the people possess any of these large boats
They have small boats with which they fish lobsters
Never since I remember
From  to  feet long by  feet broad
They are halfdecked with a side deck
Seven or eight men
It is not very long since we commenced with these decked boats but we always worked with boats that were not altogether so large as these
Yes I consider them better
The fishing is for cod and ling and the curer comes as one of the crew and gets a share that is to say when there are seven men in a boat the curer gets an eighth and when there are eight in the boat the curer gets a ninth part
The curer purchases the fish
Yes
About  There is one that perhaps may have cost  but the average would be about 
No
The small ones do but not the big ones
Yes everyone that can
No  the payment is according to the amount of fish received
The payment is partially in arrears  and of late years we have not been so successful as in former years so that less money is made
The rule is that wages are given to a man and in addition to that Is per cran of the fish caught
I believe a hired man gets more in wages now than he got twenty years ago
Hector Mathieson curer Valtos
No only as one of the crew of the boat
Yes
Yes
We dont bring the boat to the east coast fishing at all
From the beginning of spring until about midsummer
No it is not used the rest of the year
A ling counts twice a cod and the year before last some ling were bought for s and some for d
That was the rate the year before last
This last season we dont know the price we will get till the time of settlement comes
At Martinmas
No
Meal and fishing material and this year especially we have drawn already more than the account for the fish wilt cover
Very seldom now but there were seasons when I commenced first when such was the case
I never worked for any man in the parish till this year
I used to fish for Mr Smith at Stornoway
I cannot tell the price I shall have to pay at Martinmas for the meal I take now from the curer but I can tell the price of last years meal
They said it was s per boll
Yes poverty compels us to do that
The curer is bound to keep the boat in working order but he pays for no share of the fishing material
In the event of the boat being lost as to who should have to pay for it I cannot say but if it were lost through no fault of ours I would consider it hard to have to pay for it myself
I am not aware she is
The same arrangement
Yes
I have to state that we poor people have been sent to a headland of the sea where it was not worth while to send sheep forty years ago and that was the reason we were sent there
We were crowded all together upon it
In my fathers days there were sixteen crofters there
There are forty houses now
Many of these were sent from the other townships that were clearedpoor people that could not go away to America
Because there was no other place for them they were hurled in upon that headland
When I open my own door there is no place within the range of my sight except where there are big sheep
There are now so many poor that there are twentythree crofters in the township who have only one cow each and not one of them can say it is his own cow after all
From s to   each
There may be some lots which are rented higher than that but these lots are subdivided
There are three crofters upon one lot where each pays 
It was portioned out into lots during Sir Jamess time but there were crofters there before
I dont remember it ever being held by a tacksman
We have been there ourselves for four generations
I believe that over twenty of the present families are the descendants of outsiders that came in within the last forty years
About six
Some of them were subtenants of other people
But when other two townships were cleared before Sir James got possession of the property there was a considerable number that came in then
The place was poor before and then when those who were too poor to be sent to America were added to those it made them poorer still
Partially with the caschrom and partially with the spade
There were horses in my fathers time but wheu the people were thrown in upon them the horses had to be sent away
No
Yes
Yes
They complain that when the township was lotted out the rent was about  Some of the lots were as low as s each and it was arranged that those who paid only s of rent should be raised to    so that they might carry some stock more or less
There was a piece at the end of the town which was not calculated in the lots and it was arranged afterwards that this should be added to the smaller portion of the lots and that no rent should be paid till they took a crop out of it because it was uncultivated ground
Now this portion was valued at    and belonged to the township
It was taken from them and added to another place and they pay the   to this day
Old men told me that the township had it for sixtyfive years at a rent of    and the lots that paid formerly s and s now pay the one  s and the other  s
Again six or seven years ago although we ourselves had such small holdingsone having  worth and another s or s wortha man was brought in upon us and given a place upon the other end of the township
The passage that our cattle had for going from the township to the hill grazing was given to this man but we continued to send the cattle through this passage as of old
We did not wish to be deprived of this portion though we could bear to be deprived of the rest
The men that were sending their cattle by this passage were sent to Stornoway and had to pay  there for trespass
An Irishman
Yes
A hawker
It was the factor told us he set him there
Seventeen families
About thirtyfive years ago
There were eight before that time
It was made into twelve lots then
Yes that is the complaint
How can it be otherwise when the poor people cannot get either food or clothing out of it
Every one that can move
Yes I have ten of a family
I have been thirty years going though the whole country to obtain a livelihood
No I am not aware the town is one penny in arrears
Yes we have some away in that way
They are all mixed up in that district
Yes
Nothing outside the fence
Once we send them outside the crofts then they are upon the hill pasturecows and sheep together
We keep a man standing in front of the arable ground to keep them away from the crofts
We are not allowed to send them there
We cannot very well do that
Supposing we should send a man with a dog to chase them away any considerable distance from our arable ground they would be sure to be over our march upon the neighbouring tack and the tacksmans shepherd would poind them
Rather overstocked than otherwise
No unless we get more pasture though it would be a great advantage to get it still without more hill pasture we could not keep more stock
Have you been freely elected a delegate
Yes
I John Mathieson was elected by the people of Aird Uig township as one of the delegates to represent them before the Royal Commissioners and I beg to submit a few statements here for their consideration which may throw some light on the grievances of the crofters and the doings of the landlord and factor
Aird Uig is a small township in the most remote corner of the island of Lewis
It was first inhabited by crofters about fiftyeight years ago
Six crofters had taken it then at the rent of  It was then a piece of uncultivated moss with the exception of two or three small patches which was once used by a shepherd
The crofters then got many good promises for compensation for improvements 
C and never got any
There was a good piece of hill pasture taken from them at the coming in of a new factor on account of them not having written agreements on the rights and boundaries of the township but no reduction of rent
There are now nine crofters and five cottars in the township
There are a few of the first crofters still living in the township who have toiled all their lifetime taking in land and making improvements and never got any compensation but their rents raised
I will give one instance here of how  factors treat some of their honest crofters
One of these first crofters a very honest and respectable man who paid rents in the township for about fiftyfive years and was never one shilling in arrears all his lifetime was about twelve years ago going to pay rent to the factor a distance of thirteen miles and being in his old age and getting frail was a few minutes behind the rest of the crofters and did not answer his name when called was fined five shillings and about thirtyfive shillings put on his rent for having so much bad manners as to complain that it was not right to fine him under the circumstance
Of course that was the law of the factor and he had to submit to it and pay it
That is the kind of treatment and sympathy the landlord and factor shows to their crofters even in their old age
One of the principal grievances of the crofters is too little landespecially grazingstoo high rents and the system of overcrowding
About years ago five shillings was put on the rents of every crofter in the township for hill pasture or summer grazing and we never got it though repeatedly asked
Another sore grievance to the crofters is the want of a road to the township and also the impropriety of the site of the schoolhouse which was erected a few years ago utterly against the people of the two townships concerned an act which is looked upon throughout all the country as a disgrace in a Christian land and which inevitably deprives the children of the township of the benefit of education and this is altogether ascribed to the influence of the present factor
The highway is almost three miles from the township
There are a number in the township who ate not a diet of their own produce for the last twelve months and from year to year have to carry all their necessaries on their backs almost three miles as already mentioned over a rough and dangerous ground and as a proof of this a few weeks ago a person got his hand broken or dislocated carrying a bag of seed for his ground
We have ever been assessed with road money and getting no benefit
Our township which was formerly paying only  rent is now about  This year the Lewis Relief Committee had under consideration the necessity of a road from the public schoolhouse to our township and gave sanction to make the road but the factor persists in not giving us the road or any comfort whatever
These funds are apparently under his own command and he thinks he may use them as he pleases
As a surveyor from Lady Matheson has lately taken in a report of the arable land of the crofters which may be brought up as evidence against crofters I may just say in a word that his report of measurement is wrong and should be discarded until fair justice is done in this matter
Another general grievance is the undue influence of the factor over crofters at elections getting himself and others of his own favourites and caste elected
These are only a few of the grievances which may be offered but time will not permit me at present to go further on
John Mathieson
He is not now living
He was my uncle
A lad belonging to the place
Yes I know the tenor of it
Some of it was read and explained to me
They all know its contents
Two and a half miles
The strong ones go in summer but very few go in winter
Yes I dont believe the site could be worse chosen anywhere
The chamberlain is the only one whom we can hold responsible for the school being built there
Well he was chairman of the school board some supporting him and some opposing him
Those connected with him in the administration supported him and the thing was done
Yes oftener than once
We had some expectations that the road would be done at the expense of the committee who superintend the destitution funds in Stornoway but we have no hope of it now that Mr Mackay has outandout refused to go on with it
Whether or not there is expended in this parish and upon the rest of the property money to make roads elsewhere that not only would bring the road to the schoolhouse but to our own homes
The man himself told me
Yes he stood out against paying it for a time but latterly he paid it aud took several years in doing so
I believe it was remitted to him before he died
I believe the present chamberlain Mr Mackay remitted that sum
For every year
He paid it for a number of years
I am not aware
My own father was constable at the time and he asked him what was the reason and that was the sole reason he gave him namely that he stated to Mr Munro that the land was his so long as he paid rent for it and this additional sum was imposed upon him for his presumption
The nine crofters only
Yes my father is still living but bedridden and my name is on the rent roll along with my fathers but I am the only mainstay of the house
Sometimes three cows and sometimes four but when there is a bad year the one pair eats up the other
The summing is three cows with three calves until the calf is a stirk or four cows with no calf at all and twelve sheep
 and the assessments are sometimes as high as s
Yes some of what was within the marches of the township when it was originally lotted has been taken away from us
To the adjacent crofting township
I only heard it from my mother
I dont remember the case myself
Yes
It is not exactly easy for me to explain that matter
My opinion is that it was because the whole population were unable to express their opinions properly upon the day of the election
I believe it was in one way and even two I may say
Four
One
I believe that some at least of the people would prefer that same of those that were out should be in  and I am further of opinion that the crofter members that were upon the late board were better members both from the point of view of the administration of the estate and giving expression to the feeling of the estate than the present board are
Yes I know the encouragement that is given in the district where I live
If they transgress the laws of the chamberlain that they should be threatened with removal out of their holdings even if their houses were half built up
I believe that if the people would get the assurance that the places would be their own they would make all their endeavour to make their houses better
I consider it too little
That he is measuring places that are incapable of cultivation
No I do not know
I should scarcely say it was four
We made one piece of it finally but it was only a piece here and there at one time
I cannot say as to that  only know he measures with the chain ground that is uncultivable
I cannot understand how he should measure side by side the uncultivable and cultivable grounds in any other way
Yes I have got a copy but I know another thing
I attempted to build a house and I lost the skin off my back carrying stones in a rope and since I could not engage a mason to build it I commenced to build it myself aud when it was up to the level of the walls I had a letter from Mr Mackay telling me that when my father died I would be turned out of the croft and he did not give any promise in that letter that I should get any payment for the work that I had done
I could not be certain
Mr Mackay promised that the ground officer should come every year to see what changes and improvements were made on the houses and lauds and I have not seen oue coming yet for that purpose
We asked him often enough for other purposes and got no reply
Yes
Yes but the people did not get an opportunity of recording their votes on that day
It was a very wild and tempestuous day and they could not cross the sound
When I was a member of the board I asked the board to meet alternately upon either side of the sound so that this portionof the parish should get some justice
Mr Mackay would not agree to that
He never inquired what difficulties we had in attending upon him day and night at Garanahine at his meeting
As an instance I got a notice to attend a meeting after night fall on a Saturday evening and the meeting was to be on the Monday at midday
A boat could not cross and I had to walk back and forward twentytwo miles each way and after all there was no quorum only Mr Mackay himself attended
Not perhaps that I was not electedbut I believe that is the reason why a number of the crofters were not elected
Yes I protested against that and the people also object to the polling place being on the other side of the sound
Well if it was they who fixed the polling place I was not present at the time
I heard nothing about it any time I was at the meetings of the board till I saw the notices posted up on the walls of the church
At some of them
He was omnipotent certainly upon some occasions when I was a member of the board and upon other occasions not
I would not be afraid in the least
There was scarcely a day but myself or the others had an argument and discussed matters
I have a particular hardship of my own to tell of
In the first place when I was sixteen years old I was sent away on account of a tacksman of big sheep from Borv where I was to Cuidinish
My father was sentthe whole family
We were doing there a while as Providence allowed us till the next depopulation came upon Cuidinish and when Cuidinish was depopulated and given to another tacksman I was sent away from it
I was for two years among the sheep at Cuidinish
I have no complaint against the man who took the place because he could not put me out of it and I had no other place to go to
After that time there came another schemer who wanted to put me out of it
Then the factor Macdonald showed me some favour if a friend would allow me to get the site of a house to escape from the shepherd and which I did get
I then escaped from Cuidinish and got a bit of ground upon which I built a house at Finisbay where I am nowa little bit upon which to raise a bit of crop and feed myself and nine children
It is about twenty years since that took place and I have had no means of living there since then except what help I got from my worthy neighbours
I had been paying till I came there to four different landlords and I never was one penny in arrears when I was removed from Cuidinish so if I have not been unjustly treated I dont know any man that ever was
Notwithstanding all that I have borne myself respectfully and no person in authority ever knew from anything I said how ill I had been used
Our chief support is one son who has been in the militia and in the naval reserve at Stornoway
He is our only support
I never was a fisherman but my son fishes
The factor Macdonaldthe late Mr Macdonald of Rodel
Notwithstanding that he was very kind to me and he gave me employment as long as the kelp was worked which was for about ten or twelve years  but ever since then I have had no employment whatever
Yes
There was no meeting
We knew nothing of it till Friday last
I was only today asked to go by the people of the place along with two others
The Notices that were sent to us were kept back somewhere
I am one of seventeen families living there where formerly there were only two
About twenty years ago
They come from every place that was being put in order and from which the people were being removed
Somebody of the name of Trotter came and divided the two lots into ten
There are only ten lots still
The rent remained the same as before for the whole place
Yes
The additional seven are cottars who pay no rent
There are one hundred souls altogether on the place
Yes these cottars have grown up on the place
There is nothing else a man can do who has to remain and support his father and live in the place as best he can
Their highest rents are s
One cow two sheep no horses
We have nothing to work with but the spade and the crooked spade
We live by fishing
I began as a fisher on the east coast when I was sixteen years old and continued it as long as I was able but I am not able now
Yes
Yes
That what has always supported us and not the land
No there is no difference in that respect
The fishing has deteriorated here and everywhere else since that time
It is not so good as it was in my time
Their wages depend entirely on the fishing that they make
Yes
I daresay they get that and more now
More of the land which God created for man to take his living out of
There is  there is a tack beside us
Cuidinish
About twentyfive or twentysix years ago
Tenantry
The people who were removed from Cuidinish were sent away to Australia
A Mr MLeod
His son lives there
He has the farm of North Harris
Yes we were asking it from the proprietor when he was here this winter
He had nothing to say against it but the lease has still some time to run
We have nothing to say against the proprietor he is a very good laird
No
About two years
Yes
No they went of their own free will

They were making a living there
They went away because they thought they would do better in Australia
We did not ask for Cuidinish then
If we had done so we would not have got it
Malcolm MLeod got it first the father of the present occupant
No
They are in debt for meal and for food
I have two sons in the militia and it is on what they get there that we depend
They bring home not more than  or  s
They cannot bring more
Yes if we got a reasonable rent that we could afford to pay
Meal and water
Milk is not to be had at all
Porridge
Sugar and treacle
Sometimes
There are some of them that would do very well if they had enough of food without milk which they have not
We get mussels on the shore near us which we make use of as part of our food
It is only when we have no other food that we go to get the mussels to live on
Have you been freely elected by the people Time was so short that there was no meeting of the people
It was Mr Davidson who mentioned it to me
I can add a little more to what the previous witness said
I was there when there were only eight tenants in Geocrab
Before my fathers time there were no people there at all
No person can conceive what kind of a place it is without seeing it
There is no highway there for cart nor horse
I was born there
They had it among them in common
They had no lots among them but the hill was divided into four parts each of which was divided between two
Every year
The lots were better but the people in these times preferred to have them in common
I have seen a woman weeping at being separated from her neighbours by the division of the crofts
To MLeod of MLeod
We did
I dont think there is any such thing done now
Everybody had shielings in my youth
We have the same hill
Yes we do
Everybody herds his own cattle
The tenants made the division themselves
When people were removed from Rodel that was the first thing that spoiled us
There were twentyfour tenants there
Three of them were sent iu among us and the rent was not changed and these people paying their own additional rents
In the beginning of summer
Till Lammas
All young and old
Yes the women and children went and stayed the whole summer living in these shielings
Yes leaving the milk in the shielings
Yes
Yes they used to spin with distaffs and spindles
Yes they had pleasant times there
Yes I often helped also
Yes and lived in the shielings
Yes those that could would sing
It is they that would
In those times they would sing and dance and have tunes
I have no recollection of any particular chant which they repeated
I never saw or heard anything of the sort
Like ordinary houses built of stone and turf
We slept on the floor with the heather below us
Yes
Yes
I dont know when it began but the last eviction took place in my fathers time
Yes
Yes I know him very well
I dont know anything particular
Yes he was
For something he was concerned in that was done against the authorities at the time the people were being removed
I was at Portree fishing when the cutter brought them to Portree
These people were removed from the west side of the islandfrom Little and Middle Borv
Yes I have seen some
Yes good accounts have been received of some of them
None of them ever come back to see this part of the country
No their condition was in no way improved
They were sent away to the Bays
If there was any benefit derived by anybody it was by those who got the land we had such as Mr Stewart
Yes the land from which the people were removed was also added to the farm of Rodel
That was when Mr Macdonald was factor
Yes
No
It is only four days since we got notice of this meeting which was conveyed to us by the Rev
Mr Davidson
It is now thirtyfive or thirtysix years since I went to live in the Bays
There were eleven crofts or lots when I went to live at Geocrab
There was only one cottars house there at that time
There are now twentysix crofters who have the same lands among them that the eleven had
I may call them all cottars except three
The rest have only bits of the land that their fathers had
Twentysix of all classes
There is one family that came from Sir Edward Scotts property
Another from Lewis
The rest grew up in the place
No
Before my time the land was divided into eight lots by a surveyorMr MLade
Then after that there were three additional crofts taken off these eight increasing the number to eleven and there was no reduction in the rent of the eight
No
There was no land taken away in Geocrab
Lord Dunmore has not raised the rent one penny so far as I know or his father or mother before him
I have a right to keep four cows but as I have only half a croft I can only keep two cows
The other half of my croft was given to a brotherin law of mine
There is not a horse to be seen in the place
It is all rocks
We are so surrounded by rocks that sometimes we never see the sun at all
There are three hours of the day when we dont know there is a sun at all
There is no prohibition of horses
I have about a dozen sheep but I might keep as many as I like
Yes  our hill marches with Lord Dunmores forest but there is no prohibition how far we may extend our pasture
We suffer no injury or trouble from being on the same march with him
 Os d of rent and s of taxes
Up to four years ago I was paying s d now I only pay s
There was s of road money at that time
The complaint is that at the time I spoke of first there were only eight or eleven crofters when we had land enough to let a sufficient quantity of it lie fallow and recover its strength which it cannot now do
The forest is for the most part quite unsuited for cultivation  the only ground near us suitable for cultivation is Luscantire
It is not suitable for crofters
It is mostly wild moor and some pasture lower down
Yes the lower part of itShellibost and Isibostis very well situated
That is good land
We heard there was such a Commission but knew nothing of the time they would be here
Mr Davidson himself did not know
I am not aware that the notices were sent any sooner
There might have been more but they would have nothing more to say than I have told
Yes
Yes
Yes every word so far as I know
No we have plenty of seaware
The wind drives it towards us
That gentleman never prevented us
He never charged us any money for it
The island of Tay
That island is our own  we pay rent for it
No
Yes but it is falling off
It takes about threequarters of an hour rowing on a good day with a favourable wind
There is no peat at all on the island of Bernera
No they get it from another island that Mr Macdonald has called Vacasay
No Vacasay is a little outside Tay  but another island where Mr Macdonalds grieve and some of his people live and get their peats is nearer than Bernerathe island of Stroma
There is no doubt we would be
It is the scarcity of the land which leaves us in the condition we are
I have to say of my own croft that the rent is  My family consists of my Avife and myself and all we can raise on my croft will not support us for three months
Two cows and a mare
About six ewes but it is on other peoples land I buy grass for them
I buy the seed which I put into my ground
We formerly used to thatch our houses with straw when we had more of it but since then we chiefly thatch them with bent which we mostly get from Mr Macdonald
That gentleman would take nothing from any poor man whom he could help
Those who are fit for it undoubtedly would
It is past my time
I have not for five years sold a beast off my own lands till last year when I sold a stirk to pay the rent
We can say nothing against the landlord
Many things can be done under a laird without his knowledge
He lives here at Obe
Very seldom
He must be doing some good for we sometimes send for him or go to him
There was formerly a packet which used to run between this and Uist and also a packet that ran to Skye
There is no packet now
I cannot say positively except that I heard some say it was so
Anyone of us might break his arm or leg and then we would need a doctor
I pay 
I am not very sure
There is s of road money and s for the doctor
I think they all pay that
There is so much in the pound for poor and school rates
Yes we are in need of a road from south to north
There is one cart in the island
I dont know
On the west side of the island where I live it would be very difficult to make roads for us it is so subject to the drifting of the sand
On horses
In the time of my father there was an assessment of s d for the minister s d for the packet and s d for the doctor and when Sir Edward Scott bought the north end of Harris there was a doctor appointed for that part of the island and s d was added to the former assessment on our island for two doctorsone for each end of the island
We would like to know the details of the taxes which we are called upon to pay which are not specified in the receipts that are given to us
Yes both by crofters and cottars
Most of the people of the island were there and there were seventytwo present when I read this paper which I now present to the Commissioners
Yes
The first paper is on behalf of the crofters
About thirty years ago
The whoie island of Bernera was formerly divided among the crofters
Uisgary is the north and Borv the south end of Bernera
Factor Macdonald
He gave it to Mr William MNeill
There was no reduction of the rents of the people at this end of the island
Two years before that the factor collected all the cattle of the island and took them to pay their arrears of rent
Fiftyseven years ago the island of Hermitray was taken from them where they had pasture and thirtyfive years ago the island of Susay was taken away from them
There was no reduction of the rent when these islands were taken from them
Yes they desire that the whole island should be given to themselves to be distributed among crofters and cottars
It was  before and the tenant gives  more now
I could not say till I would see it paid but I think they could
Yes if I could get it
I would rather have a thing myself than let another man have it but if I did not get that myself there is no man I would rather see have it than the man who has it at present
The composition is all my own but I noted down and made a scroll at first of the substance of what the others told me
There was no assistance given by anybody outside the island
At home
I never learnt it at school
Yes there are
Yes
I felt more sure in writing Gaelic that I would not put down anything I could not stand to
A board school
Yes
I dont know how many attend that school but in the Sunday school there are ninetyseven attending
Yes
Yes most of the children can read the Bible in Gaelic
There are fortyseven cottars
There are twenty tenants as they may be called and ten with half lots
The population of the island is  having increased during the last ten years by seventytwo
These include the whole cottars on the island and of these some are on Mr Macdonalds part
There are about thirteen cottars on Mr Macdonalds farm besides his own servants
Mr Macdonalds is the larger half
His end of the island is the better today whatever
Yes it has grown so weak that it gives bad crops
I dont know
No
We were suffering many things and we were willing to suffer in case we should lose the more by what we would get
Whatever work is to be done on the farm
The payment is regulated by the grieve and I am not very sure what it comes to but it Ued to be ground for a barrel of potatoes for four days work
The payment is never in money
In former days it was one days work for a barrel of potato ground
Mr William MNeill had it
It was given to this Mr Macdonald on Mr MNeills death
I am not sure
Lord Dunmore
Both cattle and sheep
There is not much of it under crop this year
There is a stone dyke on the east side  on the other side is macher land where the sand is constantly drifting up and down and a fence could not be erected
The crofters and cottars of South Harris of this generation have no charge of oppression or injustice to bring against their proprietor or his officials
The proprietorthe Earl of Dunmoreseeks in every competent way to promote the welfare of his people and the Dowager Countess of Dunmore is greatly esteemed in Harris for her longcontinued endeavours to advance the social comfort of the people
Some painful evictions there may have been whose sting rankles in the bosom of a few survivors to this day and there were also frequent removals which were most detrimental to the subject in loss of time and substance
The discontinuance of the kelp manufacture has been a great loss to the crofters of South Harris
The crofters when engaged in kelpmaking got meal to support their families for three or four months in the year and they earned money to pay their rates
This kept them from falling in arrears with the estate
There is now no work oo the estate that will enable them to pay their rent by labour
Last winter the proprietor did provide some work which proved a great help to many of the people
Generally the crofters have no capital and when the season proves unfavourable in regard to crop and fishing they have nothing to keep them except any little stock they may possess and if they are forced to part with it they are wholly destitute
For instance if a man at such a time has to sell a cow perhaps he may not be able to buy another cow in his lifetime
Overcrowding has a tendency to impoverish for instance where three sons with their families share the croft that their father occupied alone
Huddling the people together in some particular localities mossy bogs as they are in Ardvee or Finnisbay while other larger areas of the country are almost without an inhabitant is most injurious
Fishing is a most precarious source of industry in Harris especially the herring fishing
The people buy materials and waste their time about it and often gain nothing by it
They earn something by the lobster fishing
Through the complete failure of the herring fishing for the last few years and of the cropsespecially last yearmany of them have fallen considerably into arrears as they were obliged to lay out all their earnings in meal for their families
This year many of them could not have put down their crop but for the aid they received from friends in the south
That aid was most seasonable
Quis cito dat b dat
I would suggest that the people should get a competent portion of the earth to cultivate
The want of a road through the East Bays of Harris and bridges on the rivers is an unspeakable grievance and hardship
All the crofters pay road money
This is not a country for the squatting system of farming where there are men to cultivate the soil
It is most unnatural that man should be chased away to make room for sheep and deer  that the land should lie uncultivated when men are perishing for lack of food
It is very unnatural that old or young should not be allowed to cast a hook into a standing lake or stream to catch a trout without being pursued by an officer of the law
This Royal Commission has a most sacredI had almost said divineduty entrusted to them
The state of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland for many generations to come will be influenced either for good or evil by their report
The heaven even the heavens are the Lords but the earth has He given to the children of menMans original charter was God blessed them the parents of the human family and God said unto them Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it  and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that liveth upon the earth
May I add a few words
With regard to this crowding the most of the people are driven to the East Bays
There are about  people about the bays between Rodel and Loch Stockinish within au extent of seven or eight miles
There are a great many cottars and this kind of crowding has a great tendency to impoverish the peoplewhere there are so many for instance three families on one lot
And in Finsbaythe place I mentioned formerly there are three families on a plot of ground that pays s of rent
The only other particulars I could wish very especially to bring before the Commission is the want of roads in this part
We have no road I may say from Rodel to the place where the bays pass with the main road that goes round the west side to Rodel
There is a distance of some fifteen or sixteen miles and there are eight large streams
We often call them burns but large rivers is the proper term as they are quite impassable during a flood and life has been lost there and many very narrow escapes with life frequently
I may say
The people have been paying road money for many generations
All the crofters pay road money and before my time I believe all the adult male population were made to pay road money
I heard it said that every young man whether he had lands or not had to pay s in the year for road money
Another thing in regard to Strond herethe south end
We had a conversation with the people there last night and they think that their land is rather too highly rented and the reason for that is that the rent was put on the land when they had this kelpmaking in connection with the landthat the rent was put on the land very much in proportion to the convenience and facilities they had for kelpmaking
Now the kelpmaking has ceased  it is gone but what they consider its burden still remains on the land I shall be glad to answer if I can any questions that may be put to me
At Finsbay there were only two crofters in times past and now there are seven or eight besides a number of cottars
Yes
Well there have not been any particular removals of late
I dont know it is exactly within twenty years that the people were removed from the south end of Bernera and when they were removed from the island of Pabbay
A good many of them were sent to the island of Scalpa down in Loch Tarbert and other parts through the country
The places they would get in the island of Scalpa would require to be taken in
I believe there was no cultivation there before
A great many were sent there and they would be sent perhaps where there was a person occupying a lot and one of these people would be sent in on that lot
Well there were no crofters left behind
A great loss
Well I dont think the one made up for the other at all because the stock is a very poor stock generally and there was no change I would say in the price of stock or in the increase of stock that would make up for that loss
Since the year
No I am a native of near Inverness
Yes
Well I think they are nothing better whatever
They were suffering very much at the time I came here from the failure of the potato crop in  and  They were in a very depressed state at that time but I dont think there is any improvement since that time
I cannot say it is very apparent that they are getting worse but I dont think they are getting better at all for when they are crowded together that way it is a very great discomfort to them and diminishes the supply of everything
Certainly
There is no place in Harris I believe for grain and crop like the island of Pabbay  and the south end of Bernera too I think is good for crop
Yes a good many
The school board are endeavouring to compel the children to attend but still they suffer from want of both food and clothing
Well generally
There are some who may remain back but generally they dont
There is very little intemperance in this end
There are no shebeens so far as I know and we are most thankful that there is no public house
Strong drink is not sold in any part in this end
Yes in South Harris
Not now it is discontinued and we are very thankful for it
No
Not to the south but they go to the herring fishing in every partto the Moray coast and Caithness and everywhere
There was
I think two or three batches left this country for Australia
I cannot exactly mention the date but the last batch I think left in
They are not very desirous to emigrate at all
There was a sort of move among them here in spring to go to Queensland but they heard such bad reports of the place in their estimation that they just gave up the idea of going
Yes I think they get good crops
Not on the west side
Sometimes it is windy
It is a good deal exposed to the gales from the Atlantic but still the land is dry and I think in favourable seasons would produce a very safe and sure crop
Yes
I cannot very well say whether they did or not
They were not there very long  they were there a year or two
The place was put under crofters in my recollection but I think they were behind in arrears and were removed without delay
There is no question but the place is good for crop
Yes Mr Kenneth Macdonald has good crops
Well the crops were not good for some time and they did not succeed at all at the herring fishing for some time back and they did not even get their wages at the herring fishing for some time back which was a great drawback to them
There were several causes which concurred in throwing them into arrears at that time
I have
A great deal
The west side of Harris here is out of cultivation so far as the crofting system is concerned
I may say that from Tarbert to within sight of us here was a place at one time filled with crofters
Yes and there is no crofter population there now
Not much compared to the extent of the arable land
Very much diminished
There is the home farm  and then Mr Roderick Macdonald Caolas has another farm  Mr Donald Macdonald Scaristaveg then Scaristavore  and then the farm of Luscantire which is a very extensive farm and extends to Tarbert
Yes
These are all the large farms  and there are the islands of Ensay and Pabbay
These places especially Pabbay were filled with a crofter population
I cannot state the number but there are not very many
No
I would say there was more of the land under these landsunder the large farmsthan we have under the crofter population in the bays
I think there may be some in this house who would be eyewitness of that
Yes
The one or the other
I think it is about stationary
None unless a shepherd or two
No but there was a very considerable crofter population
I should say there would have been about  souls
To Mr Stewart Ensay
He also possesses some smaller islands in the Sound of Harris
No
There is such a man and he had some intention of coming forward to be present here but I think he did not come forward
Donald Matheson
Ardvee Finisbay
Yes
This is a part of the subject I do not wish to enter into as I was not an eyewitness
I know there are present here about this house those who were in Harris at the time and who could give an account of these things
I dont mean they are altogether prevented but it is a rule they are not allowed to fish
Yes
A person would be afraid to go out to any of these lochs or streams to fish
No the mountain lakesin the burns and streams
In some of them
At Obe I think there is a place where they are not allowed to fish
I think that seems to be a part of the fishing connected with the estate
We were in the way of reading the papers
The sheriff went up to Edinburgh and Glasgow and told the state of the people at these placesand then there was a move made to make a collection on their behalf and we thought we were as much entitled to it as any one else
Yes
Yes and a good sum
Most usefuL It enabled the people to put down a crop and I hope that with the favourable season we expect they will have a more favourable crop
We are most thankful to every person who put his hand to that work
Most beneficial and useful
There is no question it was both in the way of seed and food
A few
There are tame deer about the mansion house of Rodel but very few on the hill
Not much
There used to be a few and they used to come down sometimes but there was nothing to speak of
Not that I am aware of
I never heard that any damage was done here
There is no doubt it is
The land is quite exhausted it has no heart
I think there is a great deal more
Yes
They import almost every grain of meal they consume
They make very little meal in the bays of Harris
Yes
There is a mill at Obe
It is in working trim just now
Sometimes it is and sometimes not
There is a mill at Loch Tarbert but it is far away from here
They drained a good deal of land
They improved the roads
They built dykes and cut down some plantations
I think he was giving about s and s d
Well they could not go and come to their own houses every day
They had to lodge at Rodel during the week and they went to their own homes on the Sunday
It was out of reach of many of them
It was placed to account of arrears and they were getting money and meal too
No I think he was giving them meal and money
Very great consequence to the people that could avail themselves of it
Yes they are good boatmen
Yes and I may mention a good many go to the militia and they attend the naval reserve training
I cannot exactly state the number
There may be twenty or thirty through the whole country
Perhaps twenty
Yes they considered it very useful at the time
About a month in summer
They are away till about the beginning of August
No they go away to the east coast fishing just from the militia training and to the Caithness fishing too
Not many
No they never went
Yes kilt making
That is their principal employment and of late years it has been very useful to them
Well the Countess of Dunmore takes some interest in it as well as other parties
I see they get very much into the way of dealing with the local merchants in order to get meal
Well generally
Perhaps not every family but very generally they are
Yes
Not very muchperhaps about s but I can hardly say whether that is the fixed price
Almost every kind of cloth
Yes they use native dyes
They have generally some lauding place for their boats
There is no regular harbour in any place from Tarbert till we come to Rodel where there is a sort of quay
I dont think they complain very much
They are well acquainted with the shore and they know where these landing places are
Yes small boats
Yes young men through the country bring a good many of them
I cannot mention the number but there are a good many of them throughout Harris
Yes they get them from the fishcurers and bind themselves to pay for their boats by fishing
Yes and to the Caithness fishing
I dont think there are any in this country intended for the Moray side
Yes no doubt
They would be safer and better adapted for the work than these small boats
They cannot go any distance from the shore with these small boats
Occasionally they catch a good many cod and ling but I dont think that is any great source of industry for them
They do sometimes earn a little in that way
Well there is
They dont go now
There was such a place and they used to go in summer from these bays but they have given it up
Yes they send their cattle to the hill
Every day
No they dont
Very little in Harris
I am not aware
As far as I am aware there is not a bit where they go on the runrig system
There may be a creft where there are two parties occupying one croft and they go on the runrig systemjust rig about
No there is not a township so far as I am aware of that kind in Harris
Well it would be generally made by the ground officer and by the people themselves
That is the popular name in Gaelic for the ground officer
I never heard that
There might be some such thing but I never heard of it
Well I dont think it existed at all
I saw nothing of it in this part in my time
A great many things were put down in this country before I came
I should think it would give land to the present population if the land were distributed among the people
I think it is quite capable of bearing all the people in comfort
No
Yes
There are eight cottars along with usnine crofters and eight cottars
There are three crofts upon which there are two of these each
Yes I was born on the adjacent township
He had a croft there half of that township
 or  a year
I was the youngest
I may say I have none at alL They belong to the merchants who keep us alive
If we paid the merchants that keep us alive from the beginning of summer we would not have much stock just now
When prices are good we may have a little to our credit when they are not good we have nothing at all
I have two cows two twoyearold queys and three stirks
Yes
Two sheep
 s
Yes he needs that
They have not grass to eat this year
Yes Unto the Chairman of the Royal Commission
This statement is in behalf of the crofters of Knockline seen and approved of by the same tenants
I was born in the township of Knockline in which I am now a crofter
My father was a crofter there also
According to the history of this township as I learned from my father and other old pepole who inhabited the place from time immemorial up till the time of my father and those living at that time it was tenanted by eight crofters paying a reasonable rent
Each crofter at that time lived very comfortably buying very little of foreign produce if any at all
The division of the township into crofts was rearranged and instead of eight as formerly there are now twenty crofts and the rent is increased according to that
Some time ago Loch Eport side belonged to our township which was of immense use to us for grazing our cattle during the summer time
This place was taken from us and we got no reduction of rent although we were deprived of the place
This place was afterwards given to the tenants who were evicted from Sollas
Thirtytwo years ago our crofts were drained and we were told at that time that we were to pay a certain sum yearly for the said drainage and at the end of twenty years we were to stop paying it
For twelve years now we are paying that money and not only that but it has been put upon us with rates as part of our legal rent
Marivall was our hill pasture by rights and we now pay three shillings each for it
At present there are twentythree crofters or more properly twenty crofters and three of these subdivided and twelve cottars
These twelve cottars pay a yearly rent to the proprietor and although they are a burden upon us we get no reduction of rent for what they pay to the proprietor
We have a piece of common where we keep our cattle sometimes and which is very convenient to us especially in harvest and spring from which the proprietor cut a small park last year for one of the cottars who is not a native of the place at all
We sent him a petition which showed him how inconvenient it would be for us to part with any of that ground and how unwilling we were to do so but the said petition was of no consequence to us
He did not reduce a single penny of our rent for what he gave to that cottar
Our lots are by far too small for us and as the land does not get any rest by leaving part of it uncultivated for some years it has been rendered unproductive and poor and before we can be raised to better circumstances we must get more land
If some of the tacks on this estate were divided there would be enough of land for the people
We would urgently demand the right to buy our holdings for so many years to have them increased to as much land as will support each family in comfort that we should not be removed from our holdings as long as we pay fair rent that we shall have compensation for whatever improvements we make on our dwelling houses and crofts in the event of our being removedARCHY MACDONALD ARCHY MACDONALD Knockline
A piece that was right in the heart of the township which formed a track for the cows of the township to got round the bay back and forward to the pasture
I dont know that there was an acre of it altogether but still it was a great loss to us
Yes and the proprietor would not take it from our hands except by putting it through the hands of the factor and then we sent a petition to the factor and we never heard anything more about it
The factor can answer that question
The rumour was that he paid   
Yes and every crofter upon the township that pays rent he gets  from him too
The greater part of them pay   
It was taken from us entirely
There is not a hoof of our cattle there since they got possession
No
Yes it would be well worth 
 or  up to   a piece I cannot tell the total amount
When the crofts were lotted out the rents were fixed in that way
Yes
I know that five or six of them pay rent
So far as I can make out they pay   a piece
Yes  I knew that one of them paid s once but I understood it was reduced last year and this year
Twelve years after the crofts were lotted out additional two crofts were taken out
Yes and they have reason but still we have great reason to complain of their being a burden to us in addition to all our other burdens
There is plenty of land if only the cottars and poor people who need it got it
 Unto the Chairman and Royal Commissi on to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland at the meeting to be held at Loch Eport on th May  Statement Petition and Complaint of the Cottars of Knockline Honourable Gentlemen We the above cottars have to state that we are in a miserable condition as to the way we live
We are left as a burden on the crofters without any way of living by labour in this island
There is no public works in it that keep us and our families alive and nothing is given or allowed to us
Our hovels or poor habitations are so close to the sea and in such a low place that the tides are coming into our houses sometimes now and then that we were almost drowned and obliged to save ourselves on the top of our beds
Our peats potatoes c swept away by the tide
Besides this we are not allowed to remove or get houses built in higher grounds to save us from the tide also are charged such heavy rents for these hovels from s d to    s c which the most of us have not any thing to pay for it
We beg the Commissioners that they would consider our poor and miserable state or case and plead hard in Parliament for us who have no money or other stock to plead for us to get some waste land with rushes and heather plentiful annexed to large tacks without any profit to those who have might be useful to us to cultivate and keep us alive
The number of cottars at Knockline is sixteen Balemore eleven KnockanTorran nineteen
 Unto the Royal Commissioners appointed to inquire into the state of the Highland Crofters and meeting at Loch Eport on th May   The Statement Petition and Complaint of the Crofters of Balemore North UistIn  Balemore was divided into eighteen crofts but twelve years after the then factor Mr Allan Cameron cleared several townships for himself and seventeen families were placed in Balemore and the land subdivided among the thirtyfive without any reduction of rent to the former tenants in which state it has since continued
Shortly after we were deprived of a grazing pendicle at Loch Eport which was given to crofters cleared from other places and still no reduction of rent
Another complaint is that our crofts are so small that we require to plough them every year consequently the returns are very small indeed
We complain also that upwards of thirty years ago a loan was obtained from Government for the purpose of drainage to be repaid principal and interest in twenty years but this charge has been made a permanent addition to the rents
We complain also that cottars are placed on the crofts and paying rents to the proprietor without a corresponding reduction to the crofters
We complain also that for upwards of fifty years we have had to pay rent for a hill called Marviall which formerly had been held as grazing ground by us and neighbouring townships and to the possession of which the townships were entitled without any additional rent
What we would require to live comfortably upon is at least double the size of our present holdings
The land would thus get rest and become more fruitful yielding both more provender for our cattle and meal for ourselves
Our cattle would be in a better condition and yield better prices than they do at present having to sell them lean for small sums to pay for the meal c which we have got on credit
Besides increased holdings we would require leases and in case of removal compensation for improvements and unexhausted manures
Were these granted and land sufficient and there is plenty in the parish there would be peace and plenty instead of living from hand to mouth and contracting debts as many of us do in the best of years with scarcity and hunger for man aud beast on the failure of potatoes and other crops as this years
There would then be no need to go abegging for money meal and seed to rich aud sympathising friends in the south
We would have comfort if not luxury within our own parish
Though we lodge complaints and make demands we have no fault to find with either our present proprietor or factor
The former has made no addition to our rents or taken any lands from us since his father bought the estate and the latter deals kindly and leniently towards usANGUS FEASER EWEN MLEAN  NORMAN MLELLAN LOCHEPORT
Some of them came from Ireland so far as I have been able to learn and they were settled there without leave asked by order of the then factor
About thirty years ago
They came to the country from Ireland as tinkers and the factor allowed them to remain
Those of them that had horses and some stock at first paid rent to us but since the proprietor some seven or eight years ago took matters into his own hands they ceased to pay rent to us and said they would settle with the proprietor
The rent variess s s
Some never pay any except taxes others so far as I am aware pay regularly
The very thing
I heard the most of it
In so far as their statements concern matters that are within my own recollection I quite agree with them but I am unable to say about events that occurred before I was born
West from here
Balranald and KnockanTorran lie between it and Houghgarry
Yes
The smallness of our holdings is the chief complaint
When our crofts were subdivided that was the date upon which our affairs got into such a condition that they have not recovered since
 Unto the Royal Commissioners on Highland Crofters
The Memorial of the Undersigned Cottars residing in the Township of Houghgarry Parish of North UistHumbly sheweth that from the want of land for tillage it is hardly possible for your memorialists to make but a bare livelihood especially such of them as have families to provide for
They are in the habit of getting annually small patches of ground for raising potatoes from the crofters to whom they are a great burden in many ways were it not for family relationship and other connections with them your memorialists would from sheer want of the common necessaries of life have been on the paupers roll before now
Their chief hardship is that they cannot get holdings of land to cultivate for which they would willingly pay a fair and reasonable rent to the proprietor who has been demanding yearly rent for the site of their houses but which they were unable to pay by reason of their destitute circumstances
If each of your memorialists got a suitable portion of ground near the seashore for raising potatoes and corn in a place convenient for landing seaware with creels it would be the means of ameliorating their present miserable condition
There is abundance of land of that description in many parts of the west side of the island if they could only get it
Your memoriahsts humbly submit their case of real hardship for the special investigation and consideration of the Royal Commission
Signed by fifteen persons
It was added first to the tack of a Mr James Maclean who occupied Benmore
Yes
The marches were such that Balranald was here and a small strip belonging to this township jutting in between this and the grazing of Benmore and Mr Cameron the factor just added on this bit to Benmore without consulting the people about it
No 
Yes before the proprietor and the factor
Oh yes it could easily be done
It is only fortyfive years since it was added to Balranald
Yes most of them belonged to the place
They get a patch of land here and there and they have a horse and cart by which they work that patch of land
The maintenance of that horse falls upon us which is a very great burden upon us
Some of them go south to work and make their living in all sorts of ways
They pay no rent to the crofters
I dont think they pay to the proprietor either
I did not hear much of it
Yes we are very much crowded in
We have no provender for the cattle
We have no pasture at alL Our cattle die for want of grass
It appears that when they go and eat the seaware during the day unless they get a good bellyful of barley fodder when they come home they fall into a trance and die
It is not any poison in the seaware but when they eat it it takes the heart out of them and unless they are refreshed by a feed of barley they are the worse of that but if they are they are the better of it
Then we give them handfeeding twice a day during summer and autumn
Because they are not able to write
Only three
There are twenty crofters and fourteen cottars
There are only three of the crofters
It may be that a cottar may be able to sign his name
Yes
Yes for fortythree years
Twentyfour years
Yes
I have read it more than once
To a very great extent it does
The circumstances of the people have changed less or more since that account was written but as a whole I think that they can bear out the character that was given them at that date with regard to their circumstances and their manners
I may state that the manufacture of kelp at that time and years before then made up for everything paid the rents of the tenants in full and not only that but kept the manufacturers of the kelp in a comfortable way so far as food was concerned for seven or eight weeks of the year and all the benefits of their crofts and farms accumulated to themselves
The manufacture of kelp has now ceased and of course there is less or more change in that respect
The price of stock has risen considerably since then for a number of years back and coutinues till now which I think to a very extent great makes up the loss they have sustained by the giving up of the manufacture of kelp at least that is my idea
Yes
I should say it is in the direction of improvement
It is
They are improving themselves in their circumstances and a good deal in their manners and also in their mode of dress
I may state certainly that they do not live now so much upon the produce of the land as they did forty or fifty or sixty years ago and farther back than that
They lived wholly upon the produce of the land then which consisted of barley meal potatoes mutton beef and also pork and eggs
As for the exportation of these things from the country at that date it was a thing that was not known
More so than they have now
I would say this that they lived more substantially then and they live more extravagantly now that is in the shape of getting tea and various other things from the south that they never dreamt of then
Yes I would say so
The soil is taken in year after year and naturally gets exhausted and cannot yield the same amount of crop as it used to do
Where the land is taken in by rotation and gets a considerable amount of rest it yields as good crops now as it did then so far as my observation can go and the crop of potatoes when it is a successful year is every bit as great as it was in his time
There is a very large extent of it in the possession of crofters
It is partly divided amongst crofting farms and there are other farms called club farms where the land is equally divided at the time of laying down the crop but we have not many of that sort of farms in the country
I think there are only three club farms which was the old system of dividing the farms amongst tenants in the Highlandsnot only here but in various other parts of the Western Islands
Yes equally so
No I am perfectly confident of that
There may have been some instances in which parents gave as an excuse that the children could not attend school for want of clothing but that has been taken away by the parochial board supplying them with that article
I think it is much about the same  I do not think it is on the decrease
No I think not
It has not made much in this quarter yet
There was one but it has been given up at this term
There are only two licenced houses in the island at Lochmaddy and Carinish
No not so far as that is concerned
I may state there was another wholesale licence at Lochmaddy which has been given up also
No
Yes so far as I know
There is one statement I would like to make to the Commissioners in regard to the honesty and truthfulness of the people
I was rather annoyed to hear a statement made by one of the delegates I think from Carinish
There was a question put to him about the raising of turnips in the district and so far as my memory serves me he stated that they could not raise them there with any degree of safety because they would be stolen
Now any wandering boy may go into a field and take up a turnip occasionallyI daresay we all did it occasionally when we were boysbut as to the general character of the people I must say that they stand very high in that respect with regard to pilfering or stooping so very low
I think it is just and right in me to contradict a statement of that kind which has no foundation
Just thoughtlessness and carelessnesscertainly not with the intention of thieving
Well sheep stealing was a matter that created a very great deal of  excitement at one time throughout the whole of the West Highlands and very much in the Western Islands here
I may say it is a thing that is hardly known now or I am glad to say for a number of years back
That is quite a likely thing
I think as a rule there is
Yes there is a tendency to that
No
Two years in grass
I hold a glebe and I used to farm it but it turned out that I was a very bad farmer and I let it out to a tenant and I find myself more benefited by letting to a tenant at a rent than by farming it myself because I did not know very well how to superintend farming operations and those who worked it took advantage of me
He is a very thriving one
I think it is about two yearsfrom two to three years it depends very much on the quality of the soil
There are certain crofts in this country that have been cultivated at least for a period of sixty years year after year and it is perfectly impossible that they could yield the same crop
In regard to the raising of potatoes when the potatoes do succeed they have a very abundant crop
I have seen two barrels of potatoes planted certainly in a very good piece of soil and they yielded sixteen returns but as a rule I should say there are eight returns on the average in a good year
I should say that the usual return is a boll to the peck
There are sixteen pecks to the boll
Yes but that is a very large return I should say ten returns is the average
No
No
It is only small black oats that we raise there are a few places where there are white oats but as a rule we dont raise them
I have seen it
Yes in a very good growing year and with very good soil
I am not now
They said I was very stringent in exacting the regulations of the school board and they put in two members instead of myself and one of my copresbyters
However I know a good deal of the working of the school board
Yes I am quite aware of that
I certainly think there should have been something done because I always considered it a great hardship for the people to pay school rates and not get the benefit they were entitled to on that account but the statement which the man made was perfectly correct with respect to the supply of education by the Free Church Ladies Society in Edinburgh which is continued now
There was a school connected with the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge for a good many years and when that was given up the ladies  association took it up
So far as I remember the school board had ia view the erection of buildings there but it so happens that that has never been accomplished
No the attendance was very small the number attending was about thirty
I do not know what they think now but when I was a member of the board we very often had it under consideration but it was never decided to erect buildings
As I have said I think they had it in view to erect buildings there
I think it was s d last year
No it is s d between landlord and tenant the poor rate is the same
Upon large farmers landland that wa taken in by regular rotation
It has increased but not very much
I dont think it was
 and since the census of  it has increased
I can hardly account for that except in the way of clearing the laud for others
That is all I can say
I have
The only district in which I can see that is in the district of Sollasnot in any of the other districts which have been cleared
Yes
I cannot do that at all
Yes and I remember that myself
Yes a great quantity
I do
I am perfectly well aware of that
No
I speak of the whole island
It is not
Well he may have meant that but I may state that turnips are rather a new thing among the tenants and they would go rather more from curiosity than bad feeling
That is my impression
It has
It is
I do not think there are more than half a dozen in the whole island
Newton Clachan Avore Grenitote Sollas Vallay Ballylone Balranald
They do
No
Newton is held by oue
Clachan and Avore go with Balranald
Grenitote is a separate one Sollas is a separate one Vallay is held by Mrs Macdonald and Ballylone by Mr Stewart of Scorrybreck
That is allMrs Macdonald and Mr Stewart
He has the two hills of Lea above Lochmaddy
Yes sheep grazings
No
No
Yes
I seldom heard them complain about it
They do complain of it now to a considerable extent but that is a recent thing
The cottars pay rent to the proprietor
At any rate they are charged rent by the proprietor which is a recent thing too
I do not think the amount of stock of any of them comes to several
Some of them have a horse and cart a cow and a few sheep
I do not think it goes over that
I would say there is that at least
I would say soa very great hardship indeed
It may have arisen from intermarriages
I think that was the origin of it and they got a hold upon the croft got the stance of a house and continued until they became resident there and with nothing in their possession but what the crofter gave them
That is the only way I can account for it
I am
I should say so
So far as the hill is concerned
Yes
Yes
That is the way they generaUy work their stock in this country
They have one herd for the stock they graze on the hill and keep the arable land exclusively in their own hands
There is no reason why it should not
This island was in the possession of Lord Macdonald at the time and all his estates were under trust
There was a commissioner appointed to manage the affairs named Mr Cooper an Aberdeen advocate and he visited this island in March  He found that the people of this district of Sollas were very much in arrears of rent indeed but the principal reason of that was that they had not recovered from the very great shock of the destitution of   and  When this commissioner saw they were so very much in arrears he proposed an emigration that he would send them to Canada
This offer was accepted by the people of the district but when he came back in the month of June to make preparations for their removal he found them of quite a different opinion
A feeling had got up amongst themselves that they were singled out from the whole district of the country not with a very amiable disposition and they resisted and hence the evictions
I may also state that a very great feeling got up in the south in favour of the people and there was a large fund of money collected in order to better their condition here
The managers of this sum which was put together offered or at least guaranteed the rental of the farm of Sollasthe whole district of Sollaswhich consists of four different farmsSollas Duine Middlequarter and Maliglate
This offer by the managers of that fund was not accepted and it was then that they got possession of this black moor of Langash and Loch Eport which did not last more than a period of two years I should say
The eviction took place in the summer of  and they were allowed to remain in their houses until the following year and the most of them emigrated in that unfortunate transport the  Hercules in  They all went except those who remained at Loch Eport and are still there
These are all the circumstances that I know about it
He was powerless in it
His estates were under trust and were altogether committed to the management of Mr Cooper
There is no comparison in the world so far as my experience of land goes
There are thirtyfour crofters at Loch Eport and I should say ten would be quite enough for it
Less or more
There were but I dont think they have had any great effect upon them so far as the people of this island are concerned so far as I know
They do
I circulate a great deal of the public news among them and I read a very carefully and well conducted paper the Glasgow Herald
No
It comes here occasionally
No I was born in Skye
Yes
Well of course this year has been worse with them than any previous year since I came to this place on account of the storms and tides and the failure of the harvest
They are in need of clothing and of foodmany of the poorer people
Many of the poorer people are always in the way of going to the ebb for shellfish
That is always the case
In the nature of things the cottars must be so
There must be some difference for the cottars have less to depend upon
I am not a member of the parochial board
I hear many of the paupers complaining but I am not member of the board
I know the allowance is bare enough
At the same time a number of the ratepayers find the expenditure enough
I am fully aware of that many of them being so destitute that they can not really attend church or school for want of clothing
Not much
I have one small park
I cannot say that I am
Yes I think so
It was
I should think not
It is a help
They do not depend upon it by any means
They get cockles for the most part here
I am not aware of their getting them
They may but I cannot say
No
Well we have a good deal to do with both schools
We try to supplement that
We have Gaelic schoolmasters we have Sabbath schools and we supplement what is not attended to in the board schools the best way we can
Well so far perhaps not satisfactorily but so far as we can we try to overtake the thing
We have a number of teachers who have not Gaelic
I am always pleading for the Gaelic in our schools
I pleaded for it with the school board and I should like to see it in all our board schools
To the extent of every child being able to read the Bible
Yes
They do
Most of them understand the English sermon
Yes
There is a general complaint of the land being so much exhausted that in the nature of things the crofts cannot be so sufficient as they were in former times
Not in this island of course being so long in the island I know it as matter of fact
Very little
No
Well this meeting house is generally about full and at the communion season it cannot hold the people by any means
The parish is made up so much of detached islands that we must have service in various places besides here
When full about  people
Not just now
There is a vacant congregation
Paible
In the statement which I gave in to the presbytery I had Benbecula but that is now made a separate parish
I had between  and  people including Benbecula
I should say there are now between  and
Some  or  or more
We have been trying to get ministers there but they have been refusing our calls
Yes
I am not aware of Gaelic being taught in any of our board schools but we have Gaelic teachers apart from our board schools and Sabbath schools besides
No there would not
I think so
I have heard of it but really from my own observation I cannot say
There has been nothing of the kind since I came here
I am sure they should know
The evictions of course took place in former times but I cannot say they were entirely for the Church
It is possible but I am not in a position to say that
No we are on the very best of terms in that respect
Yes
 Island of Boreray North Uist th May  To the Right Hon
Lord Napier Chairman of the Royal Commission Highlands and IslandsSir The following are a few of the grievances of which we complain viz the smallness and dearness of our holdings the overcrowding of the people and the unproductiveness of the soiL The island on which we live is not a square mile in extent including a brackish loch covering more than  acres of land
The population is about  The most of the arable land is ploughed every year for the last one hundred which renders it so light that in spring the winds generally carry away the corn seed
There are twenty horses working the arable land
Each crofter sows on an average five bushels of barley and even in a productive year they only grind ten bushels
The cattle are almost starving in the winter for want of fodder which leaves them in a wretched condition during the whole year
In former years we used to pay our rent by draining the forementioned loch and securing and sloping sandbanks but since the present proprietor bought the island no such work exists
We generally pay our rent now by cash and some kelp
We have to carry our peats eight or nine miles by sea from the factors ground for which we pay
We are paying school rates for the last ten or eleven years and as yet the school board has not taken any steps to build a schoolhouse for us
The Ladies Association kindly supply us with a teacher
The appointed delegates will answer any question which your Lordship may deem desirable to ask themWe are your Lordships humble servants Crofters of the Island of Boreray per ANGUS MACDONALD
Yes
Twenty crofters
Yes eight cottars as well
Yes it has considerably increased
There are  now including cottars
I do not know why the present proprietor ceased
I am not aware he did any work of that kind
It would not be very easy
It enters it every spring tide of the year
The former proprietors were keeping it out before the present proprietor
They have been taking them from the same place ever since I remember
The cottars upon the island would require it all for themselves  to put them in proper condition
No
The factor is very kind to us
We did not know where he could send us
Yes
Yes
Yes to provide for all the people if only they got it
The proprietor of Boreray held it once
Only himself and his servant
John MLean laird of Boreray
Was it one hundred years ago or so
I think it is short of one hundred years but I do not remember the time within a large number of years
Lord Macdonald never had it
It was not part of the estate of North Uist at all
The MLeans possessed it all along
My father was alive when tenants were sent to Boreray
Some portions of it were given to his own servants and others came by his orders from other places
One came from Bernera and others from adjacent places in the sound of North Uist
I am not aware that we were ever so much in arrear as this year siuce the present proprietor got the property
The greater number of them are very poor indeed
There is no board school but there is a Ladies Committee in Edinburgh that supplies us with a school  That is the Free Church Ladies Association
That is the case
We pay school rates and get no return for them
The ferry is three miles broad
We never made any such representation
There are about thirty children of school age but I cannot exactly say what the attendance is
It would not take them very long if they could walk it  but the ferry is three miles
No but Miss Rainy of Edinburgh comes every second year to examine the school
No  the only fee is to provide the schoolmaster with peats and that is not very easy for those who have no boats to ferry the peats
It is not easy for them to do their share of that work
They pay the others for ferrying the peats across
I am not aware perhaps the distance is not exactly nine miles but it must be about eight at least
From Islay
For the benefit of the people of the place
Yes there was such an arrangement once upon a time
Yes
Yes when there was one to look after it the sluice raised at low water to let out the fresh water of the loch
Yes we remember the time when places that are never dry now were cultivated
The present proprietor has not increased the rent but kept it as it was left by the former proprietors
Yes when the former proprietors had it
No
I cannot tell that
I do not think they were in draining the loch
With the addition of kelp they were able to pay their rentby these works and kelp in addition
The cultivatable ground is just now as white as if it were covered with snow by the drift of the sand
About Whitsunday it is peculiarly bad and it is not oats that grow there but weeds that are not good for fodder or anything else
Yes
There is no separate paper for Maliglate
It is all in the paper
The same complaint
Twelve full crofts
Yes four crofts are divided making sixteen families in all of crofters
Five
I cannot remember the number of years it is a long while ago
A long time ago also
They wish for a great deal
Rent is high and we have to buy largely and we are burdened down with it all
I do not hear them express that wish
What I heard them say was just what has been expressed in the paper alreadythat they are hemmed in for want of land and that the land they have is exhausted by continuous cropping
Two horses five cows with their followers and twelve sheep is the summing of a full croft in Maliglate

Yes much too highthe proceeds being nothing but the outcome of the stock which is in poor condition
Yes and I would concur with even more than is in the paper
Yes
We the crofters of Loch Eport beg respectfully to take advantage of this opportunity which is now afforded us of laying the substance of our grievances before the Royal Commission which may be briefly stated as follows Among the many clearances which took place in the West Highlands the  Sollas evictions  rank so prominently both for cruelty and injustice and are so well known to the public that we need hardly now refer to them but perhaps as the remnant of the sufferers of those cruelties are now living in the country it may not be out of place to mention some of the hardships and privations to which we were exposed in consequence
About thirtytwo years ago we were evicted from the district of Sollas a fertile part of this parish
There we lived in ease and plenty in a happy and prosperous condition until we became the objects of the covetous eyes of the landgrabbing and aggrandising powers that be and we soon realised that might was right
The first indication of this was the depriving us of a large portion of our grazing and arable land which was added to another farm as well as other hardships which reduced us in our circumstances until at last we were finally evicted about thirtytwo years ago as we have mentioned
Those evictions rank among the most notorious which have taken place in the Highlands being now handed by posterity under the  appellation of  Blar Shollash or the Battle of Sollas
To this engagement was attributed the death of at least one individual the permanent disablement of others the imprisonment of some and the great loss to  many of their personal property
It resulted of course in a victory for the nobles and the defeat and utter discomfiture of the peasantry
As is always the case this battle was fruitful of immense sufferings hardships and loss to the defeated
Many of them were compelled to emigrate to the colonies but fresh trials awaited them before getting to their destination
A deadly case of fever broke out in the  Hercules  the vessel which conveyed them to which the most of them succumbed
Some were buried in Ireland others were committed to a watery grave  thus the survivors had together with all their hardships to mourn the loss and untimely end of some of their nearest and dearest relations
Others who remained got corners in other parts of the country whilst the remainder who have now the honour to address you were pitied by the Highland Committee and were supplied with labour to keep them alive until finally sent to Loch Eport where they still struggle to exist
The hardships to which we were exposed in the interval between our being evicted and our translation here are beyond description
The severities of a winter living in rude turf huts and without fuel except what we had to carry twelve miles told on the health of many
The inferiority of the soil of the place we live in and its unsuitableness for human existence is indescribable
When we were sent here it was with the exception of two spots a wild bleak barren mossy heath numerously intersected by rainfurrows
There we had to build huts in which to live and try and improve the waste as well as we could and notwithstanding that we have laboured for the last thirty years our crofts will not yield us today as much food on an average as will support our families for two months of the year
The ground is of such a nature that it can scarcely be improved and the soil so much reduced by continual cropping that it is almost useless
The place is overcrowded there being thirtyfour crofts on which live forty families where formerly there were only three
Our common pasture if it can be called by that name is extremely bad so much so that in winter those of us who have cattle must keep constant watch else they will stick in the bogs
Human beings cannot travel over portions of our crofts in winter
There is no fishing or industry of any other kind in the country from which we can derive any support
Formerly we derived some benefit from the manufacturing of kelp but now we are deprived of even that
All who are able leave in the beginning of summer to earn their livelihood as best they may by sea and land and thus help to improve the condition of their families whom they leave behind
Finally we must admit that we are in poverty and suffering privations and inconveniences of a nature to which the bulk of our countrymen are strangers
We most earnestly pray that the Commission will recommend our removal from this place to some other where we can live by the productions of our labours in the soil
Signed by thirtytwo persons
Yes perfectly well
Yes it is perfectly correct and even supposing there were additional statements they would be perfectly correct as well
The factor BalranaldJames Macdonald
No
I am not perfectly certain but I think they were
Yes we saw Mr Cook coming
It was Mr James Macdonald that was before
He succeeded but they were together there when we were put out of the place
The factor
It was he who got them first
The whole of Sollas
There were two townships
Thirty families were evicted
I saw them
Yes
No nothing
It was in autumn they were pulling down the houses
It was well on in the year
It was during the winter that the first houses were built
Yes we were charged rent
During the first winter we worked for wages and during the following summer but when the work ceased we commenced to pay rent
No nothing
Nothing whatever in the way of materiaL We only built turf houses at first
No nothing in the shape of wood or anything
Every one of them at our own expense
We reclaimed them all ourselves without any assistance so far as I know
Yes many of them
Several of them reached America
Very few are alive today
We heard of those who have survived
Some are well off and some otherwise
Yes he was not one of the evicted men
Yes
John
Upon the north side of North Uist
There are thirtyfour families there altogether
It was thirty who were evicted but there are other people in Loch Eport who were sent from elsewhere
The greater number are children of those who were evicted at Sollas
I cannot tell
They were sent out of there before I was born and I am not able to say
There is an old man at Loch Eport who knows of it but I never asked him and I dont remember having heard the exact number
Yes
No they had made fences of the ruins of the houses before I saw them
The factor
We had Mr Cumming there before him and Sheriff MLachlan before him
Yes very well
I remember them being there
Eight I believe
It is joined to the factors tack
Yes
There are other places as good though
The places we were evicted from
I think it is
Yes it used to do so
The place we were evicted from is about as desirable a place to go back to as any that could be got
The tacksman we could not gain any way
Every one of them
If I had had another man putting it into the very condition in which it was I believe it would have come to about  or 
No we had to quarry them out of a hill
I am not aware there is
The proprietor and the factor of the present day are in no way responsible for what was done to us
Yes
Every one of themtwentytwo in number
Yes
The following statement has been agreed to by the crofters of Carinish at a meeting held on the th May
In the year  I James MCorquidale remember the whole township of Carinish being in the hands of eight tenants paying  s each now there are twentytwo tenants paying upwards of  Twelve crofts are divided into half crofts with two families on each
Besides the crofters there are twentytwo cottars making fiftyfive or fiftysix families
The place is greatly overcrowded
Carinish is the highest rented farm in North Uist
The rent was fixed when the kelp was in great demand the crofters were manufacturing the kelp at    s per ton and the proprietor selling it at  per ton but as there is no kelp made now the rent should be reduced
Our hill pasture is the poorest on the estate  and although we keep some sheep we generally lose them in winter for the want of proper grazing for them
We have still some cattle and horses left but they are reduced to skin and bone and they will not sell at the July market owing to their miserable condition
Our liabilities are so great that supposing we sold all our cattle we would still be left in debt
We are deeply in arrears to the proprietor and in debt to Glasgow merchants for meal and seed this year and also heavy in debt to local merchants tailors shoemakers c
Another cause of complaint is the drainage money we are still paying the interest as part of our rent
Poorrates and schoolrates c are charged on this drainage money which has been refunded to Government a long time ago
All the drains made with that money are now quite useless and require to be reopened at once as they do more harm than good to the ground
What is absolutely required is more land with an assurance that the land is ours as long as we pay fair rent for fair value
The Government must interfere to guarantee each crofter in his holding
We will be glad to answer any questions the Commissioners like to ask us as far as we knowJAMES MCORQUIDALE ROBERT FERGUSON
Yes
Yes very much
Each had eight cows with their followers
Two horses and about twenty sheep
No we did not require it
There was plenty meal growing out of the ground and potatoes as well
Yes we did at d per barrel for potatoes
No we are always buying them
This year all the meal that was made in Carinish would not supply the people for a month
They lasted this year till the middle of spring
We buy potatoes when our own supply is done
We got them this year from the factor
We were glad to get them even for payment
I dont know
They were not promised to us for nothing
It may be that they will not be charged for
We had no oats
We got them from the factor
We got a great deal from him both of barley and oats
Partly barley
No
The ground is suitable enough but people would steal the turnips
Five cows and a twoyearold two horses eight sheep
That is what I am allowed to keep
 s
Certainly I do
I consider it twice as much as the croft is worth
Yes
No they have no lands
Yes they get some potato ground from the crofters
I am not certain but it is said they are charged s for peat ground and houses
Some came in upon us from other places
Yes there are some in that way whose fathers crofts were divided among their children
It was from the other side of the country that some of the people of Carinish came who have increased the population of the place
They came from various townships
Bailemhicphail Grenitote Bernera and Caolas
Some who lost their lands and widows
There have been always cottars but their number was increased by those who fell into arrear and had to give up their land
It was neither the present proprietor nor factor that brought things to this pass
We are perfectly satisfied with our present factor
He never oppressed us in any way
I believe some of them may have come into the place with his permission but most of them were born in the place
Yes two at any rate have cattle and sheep
Yes most of them are without a cow
They have all sheep
Upon the crofters ground
Not a penny
Not a bit
Yes a very great burden
No only diminished in the sense of people being thrown in upon them
There were only eight to begin with
Not at that time
Yes there is an estate regulation against it just now but it is not observed
Twelve
I would give each of them seven cows
Twenty
Two
I am not able to say what would be considered a reasonable rent
Yes much too high
It would be quite reasonable
Yes they were sending potatoes to Glasgow
Those who have machair landthat is on the west side  sent the potatoes to purchase meal
I think they sold them all
I was in search of potatoes and I could not get a single barrel
Balemore Knockantorran Knockanlin and Paiblesgarry
No that was our great misfortune
When the kelp was going on people were getting their living
They would get meal to support their families and also some money that would pay their rents
Seven or eight years agoperhaps ten
It was not remunerative
It was not worth the proprietors while to keep it on
The people who worked it got s per ton for manufacturing it
Yes when it fetched a high price they got   and  s
 cannot tell that
That was long ago when there were only eight people in Carinishin the year  or thereabout
There may have been four in a family that worked together and that family would make about ten tons in the summer season
They would take their feeding out of it first of all and then what remained would go to pay the rent
In some cases they could pay the whole rent in others the half and so on
At present we buy out of the shops but in those times we did not require to go to the shop  we had wool of our own and women to make cloth of it
Yes if they have the wooL
There are three weavers all women
They get plenty of work if they got payment for it
Yes they can do that very well
Yes  sixpence for a pair of socks
We send them to the shops but we sell them of course to everybody who buys
They dont make hose
I remember the time when hose were made
Yes they ask s d for long stockings that come up to the knee
Yes
To those who are hard up and without food even that is considered a great benefit
Yes
Lady Cathcart
They were making homemade clothes and stockings
I am not certain what price they got for them buf I heard them say they got a good price and could make a good living out of it
I have not heard of it for the last few years
I dont know why
The scheme worked only on Lady Cathcarts own estate
No
Certainly it would be a benefit
Yes certainly it would
Some from the sale of stock  others out of the proceeds of the east coast fishing
Dealers come round us here
There was nothing of that sort with the present proprietor or factor but I saw the day when that was done  when the stock was taken away and they would not tell the price that would be given for it
Yes

 or  last year which was an exceptional year
No it is worse
Yes
Yes it was of great service
We got a bull from Balranald and we believe it was the means of adding  to the township within three years time
The want of grass and provender
The ground does not yield fruit either in the shape of seed or of straw as it used to do
That is my summing
Three cows and three stirks
Yes
I have at least one every year
I cannot well tell but in some way or another
They must needs live upon the crofters and by shellfish and in other ways
They help us in casting peats now and again but we pay them for it
Yes such things are known as sheep disappearing
Yes
Every one of them
Yes we do
There are some in Carinish that paid  this last year for provender for themselves and their stock others paid  and others 
Yes
Yes ever since I was born
The difference is very great
I remember when I was a young man fifty years ago there used to be cargoes of barley and cargoes of potatoes exported from North Uist
They did not require to go to the militia or elsewhere
They would get plenty of work at home plenty of food and clothes
Certainly they have
For the last fiftyfour years I have been continuously cropping the same ground and how can you expect good crops out of such ground as that
I am not aware
I cannot charge my memory with any one that left the country after having made money in such a way
They themselves would know their own circumstances best but the general opinion was that they throve well
The practice prevailed under Lord Macdonalds proprietorship and when Allan Cameron was factor
He came from Mull
I believe he was factor for about thirty years
His factorship came to an end about forty years ago but I cannot give accurate dates
Yes
The ground officer Angus Macdonald came and gathered all the cattle in the place
Any animal he himself would choose to mark out he would carry away
He would send it off to market and we would not hear any price fixed for it till after it was sold
For the rent
Yes
We did not know what price it would fetch at the market
They would just give us any price it pleased them to give
Yes exactly
Yes and it was very unjust as well
That was our belief but of course we could not tell
I wish to state that for the last twelve years we are taking our meal home from Glasgow and though we have stock it is not our own
A merchant of the name of Thomas Martin Glasgow has provided for a large number of the inhabitants
Donald MLean a local merchant in Carinish also deals
Twelve bags of meal come with every steamer and I dont think he gets a penny for it but distributes it among the poor people of the place
He has not a house and we thought it exceedingly desirable that he should just get forty feet of that ground that we pay rent for if the proprietor or factor would see fit to give it to him in order to provide a suitable store for such a man is very much required and ought to be encouraged
No never
We do not ask the price until we are paying for it if indeed we can pay for it
Indian meal is s or s per bag over head flour s and oatmeal about  per bag
In Carinish
Yes
We agree that it is right
I complain of the scarcity of the land of its bad quality and its dearness
The land is not growing more plenty but more scarce
A good deal of the moor for which we are paying rent is occupied by others and is useless to us
We are deprived of the good of it and we are still paying ita portion of it for the last thirteen years and a portion during the last four years occupied by outside cottars
We are completely deprived of it during the last three years and without any of its use
I have no more to say different from what you have heard except that I occupy a piece of very poor moorland myself upon which I am not able to make a livelihood
Yes
Since my own recollection a part of the land which I occupy had only six occupants but there are now twentyseven
We have become so poor through the smallness of our holdings
I have also to complain that we are too far from the schoolhouse
Twentyseven
Six
They are the natural increase of the country
A good many of those have squatted upon what constituted our moorland grazing
I own no beast whatever
I lost a cow and a stirk and a calf this year because I was so poor that I was not able to buy food for them

Oh yes
Yes that is their complaint
Yes
Yes
Headings of the principal Grievances of the Crofters of this District to be laid before the Royal Commission in Benecula on the th May
It has reference to the whole district in the north end of South Uist
Since
With the exception of three years at Badenoch
Deteriorated
Yes
In their worldly means in their clothes and in their food
I have seen many families without blanket
Many of them are very badly clad but the generality of them are pretty fairly clad
Want of sheep and the cutting off of the hill grazing
Yes
Yes within the last six years
There was the post Lauchlan Macdonald for whom a croft was cut out without any compensation to the crofter and a lot wa cut out for widow Finlay Mackay from the crofters and they got no compensation unless they would take part of the macher and part of mans croft
No
These were sent down from Gramisdale farm from Loch Eynort or from Tyree or North Uist or Benbecula
They came and squatted on the hill grazing that was used for sheilings in summer and for grazing sheep about twenty families
No rent
They just squatted there
The factor should have kept every one in his own place until such times as lands were cut out or compensation given to the tenants for the loss of the grazing ground
If the cottars were lifted off the crofters would be prosperous enough
As the crofters have borne the burden for a long time let the large farms have a share of it for a time
They are better provided many of them than crofters who are paying rent
No
I have been only about one year on the school board and on the parochial board and I have nothing particular to state but that I find them in working order
I find the public schools are being taught here according to the Government Education Act
There are seven members between Benbecula and South UistMr Mackintosh and I Dr Black the parish minister of Uist Mr John Ferguson tacksman of Bornish Mr Charles MLean tacksman of Borv  and the factor
Not in the whole island
Not a penny
Yes
The only public work that is being carried out is erecting a wing to an inn at Carinish
Yes to the factor
They pay neither poorrates nor schoolrates and the same cottars again are determined if possible to keep their children from school
They are quite independent
They are sent here the same as penal servitude
That is the great burden and grievance of the tenants
I see them with two or three cattle as many young beasts and may be twenty thirty or forty sheep and some of them two horses
None
They neither pay me my fees nor the factor nor the schools nor the parochial board nor assessments nor the doctor
Three years ago there were seventyone families
The population in my district is about  There are  Catholics and hardly  Protestants including crofters and cottars
I should say  or
They crop our crofts as they please and graze on our grass and respect not our crofts
Some of them leave for the militia and some of them for the Lowlands and some of them take a trip sailing and that is the whole
The number of cottars is increasing yearly from large farms
I have seen one poor woman who was told to be out off a place the day after her husbands death not to be a burden on the tenant
It is very difficult to get at her we so seldom see her in the country
Many of them are not
Some of them are from Tyree and others from Skye North Uist and Loch Eynort
No
No
That was in my mind if twenty cottars were to scatter down on Nunton with all their cattle and horses what would he say
We have abstained from violence or agitation against them
Individuals came such as from Loch Eynort
They could not go against the factor
We have spoken often to him on the point and I have spoken to him personally
Where could she put them
She would not remove them to large farms
Yes in my opinion it is doubtful 
I wish specially to call attention to the parliamentary voters roll so that the crofters could have their names entered upon it
Yes we pay as high as 
 in cash
I came here in
Yes
About twenty from different quarters
Kind of huts the best way they could
Very questionably
I am the loser by it
Many of them are and many are not
Not in this district since the time of Mr Birnie when he sliced up Ormicleit Hill and Grinnisdale
Hardly within that time
Net with my own eyes
It has not been carried out since  and
It is too high and the plots are too small
It is exhausted land that produces nothing but oxeye or thistles or weeds in general
I desire however to make this statement that Colonel Gordon wished crofters whoever was anxious to pay ready cash down for his lands to get onethird reduction but no kelpno work
It is not due to bad cultivation but to the exhausted soil
The minister can allow ground to be there for years and years before he ploughs it but the crofter must plough it every year
Well I manage it better than the crofters but it is not a paying affair to me because I work it with servants but I get better returns by drainage
Yes
Yes
That our crofts are now too little being much less than what they formerly were which may be seen from the fact that twenty additional crofters are placed among us that our rents are too high for two reasons  That continual cropping has reduced the land so much that it now yields almost nothing without double quantity of manure and that that manure cannot be had being divided among the increased tenants
 That we have to pay besides rent for food for our families and provender for our cattle an average of for the last six years from  to  as the case may be which added to our rents will show what we are properly speaking paying for our holdings
If all our effects were sold and the proprietrix and local merchants put in their own very little would be left
 That we have to meet these demands either from the earnings of ourselves or our families who must go to other places to earn that money as there is no work at home
 That the common and hill grazing are taken from us except a nominal stripe of black moss more fit for peats than for grazing
Before we could be somewhat comfortable we would require a guarantee from the Government a that our crofts be made large enough to support our families b that we shall not be at the mercy of either proprietor or his agents to remove us at will c that we shall get compensation for improvements
There are forty tenants today
No crofters
Twentyseven
The natural increase of the country
No I have about nine acres of land
It is the size according to the reapportionment of the land five years ago
Yes
Yes
Two cows one horse two stirks and five or six sheep
 I wish to state that my nine acres would not support all these animals
The nine acres would barely support one of these cows
I must expend   in purchasing summer grazing for them and also wintering
Yes too small
Also that our land should be valued by Government valuators and that we should have a reasonable guarantee that we would not be disturbed from these revalued holdings so long as we paid that reasonable rent
I saw them at Loch Boisdale
I saw down at Loch Boisdale people sent to the emigrant ships by violenceby policemen and strong men
I knew especially one man who was forced by four men to the waterside in order to put him on board this ship
William Macpherson
A few yards from this house
A young strong man
Every one of the family was sent away with the father who was blind
I have not seen that but there are many here who did see such
There was one other person on the moor of Benbecula here who was removed himself and his wife and children from his house
They were lifted away from their dwelling and put into a cart till they were sent in the boat to Loch Boisdale
Donald MLennan
There were many other cases at the time when these events occurred
Well up to forty years ago
Yes
Not so forcible as that
That they were not sent away against their will altogether after that
I do not know the number
Another man states that there were about
From the North Ford to Barra Head
They were all belonging to the Gordon estates
They were crofters at all events
Yes
There were as many people after them as filled up the land which these occupied
I am not aware
The people today are in a condition as poor as I have ever known them to be
They were poor enough at that time what could they do but cut their fingers takiug shellfish off the rocks pretty much as they are doing today for food
None
I heard that they were so poor after landing without food or clothing that they died upon the roadside and were buried into holes where they died
We have heard accounts from some of them but we have heard no accounts from many of them because they were not living to give accounts
I dont remember of any such cases
They may have done so but I have no recollection
No
He offered a lease but I have never seen it
I have to complain that in the days of Clanranald there were two large crofts which belonged in those days to the townships of Torlum and Griminish and that when the present crofts of these two townships were allotted to the holders of them these two large crofts were taken from them and added to the neighbouring tack of Nunton and this has conduced to greatly press us for room in these two townships
On account of this we are behind in food and in fodder
There were no crofters upon that particular strip of land but it did belong to the townships already mentioned
Twentytwo crofts
There are eighteen crofts in Torlum and one tenant has four crofts besides those eighteen
Exactly
There are some at  s some at  some at  and some at 
I pay a rent of  s
I have four cows and three little heifers and I have also three stirks a horse a mare a yearold eight sheep and a few hoggs
My father was paying rent for seventy years and I myself have paid rent upwards of forty years
Yes
It was a common before the township was lotted and then the common was taken away from them and a new valuation made of the rents at that date and these two were valued as well and those two were joined to the neighbouring tack of Nunton
Very nearly so
The turner
Griminish
It was occupied by the late Norman MDonald and is now occupied by his widow
Very near it
Every one may send his stock as he pleases to the big common
There is no regulation as to numbers
It will not support any creature in winter
Just so
No horses at all are sent there
It is chiefly sheep and occasionally we send our cattle there also
Yes for portions of each day some days
No not those far away
Only those that are near
Yes
The smallness of the land
Yes I do complain that it is too high
I stated to the factor that he valued the eight crofts in my neighbourhood too highly my own croft being among the eight
Yes  much more
One man has a fourth part of the township and he complains that he cannot make a living on it
If I even had two I think I would be better off than I am
Yes so he does
He complains of both
Yes there are
The island of Wia
It belongs to the farm of Nunton
I dont know of any
Nunton is the best land
It would not supply the half
The island of Wia is now a portion of Nunton farm formerly part of the two townships of Torlum and Griminish
This island maintained a stock of three hundred sheep fifty heifers and thirty horses
From that stock you can conceive the island is good
So that if those two townships already mentioned received the island back along with the original strip of ground adjoining Nunton our difficulty might be solved
The proprietrix at present has in her own occupancy two vacant tacks called Ledistrom and Cregston
If the crofters who are burdening Linicleit should be removed there this would remove the pressure upon Linicleit
I believe there are plenty of places
Plenty of places
That is a large case
They have no stock
I would not wish them to possess so very much as they do now
That would require to be in every countrya difference in the size of the holdings
Yes a poor man cannot go to a big holding
I believe it costs about s
 s
s d per bag altogether
It costs s d for the carriage of it to my house so that the total cost of a bag of meal when it reaches my house is    s
I paid s to a Glasgow merchant for one boll of oatmeal
No credit longer than fourteen days or over three weeks
I am perfectly certain
Before Colonel Gordon purchased the estate in  the rents were raised not according to the intrinsic value of the croft but according to the price of kelp which then yielded to the worker   per ton while it yielded to the proprietor who was the purchaser the handsome sum of  The rents were fixed then  ndependent of the changes that might and in fact were taking place When Colonel Gordon came in he got the rents at the old figure which were so very high that the people could neither live upon nor pay their crofts
This secured a plausible reason for the most unscrupulous clearances that ever was effected in the Western Isles
The price for kelp was gradually on the decline until it ceased altogether five years ago
The people then had either to pay the rent by their daily wage or betake themselves to large towns
The people at that time had both a common and hill grazing
This common was given first for cattle grazing which consisted of heather and peat moss
A few years afterwards the people began to complain of the smallness of their holdings and the hardships which consequently followed
The proprietor then gave the people full liberty to reclaim as much as they could of the common at their own expenses with a promise that it would become a pendicle of the croft
The people wrought like slaves reclaiming this land by carrying manure a distance of two to three miles first in carts and again on their backs in creels together with the severe labour of trenching it
The Gordons proposed the work for the people with the full desire as we believe of bettering the condition of their tenants
In a short time however circulars began to come round asking the people to pledge themselves to any alterations that the proprietrix might see fit as long as she had the interest of the people in view
This the people did with the result that they were deprived of the common for which they had wrought so hard and given to others the people thereby being confined on smaller crofts than they had even before the common  was given to them it is now plain that some change must take place either to the better or worse
The only remedy now is increased holdings which would enable a family to live upon a guarantee against removal either at proprietors or factors will as long as we pay reasonable rent which we wish fixed by neutral parties compensation for improvements and when any of us would have to leave the croft from reasonable causes that the proprietor would take all our effects at valuation That the arrears incurred by the outgoing tenant should not be levied upon the incoming tenant as heretofore
That drainage and fencing could be  effected with the little expenses adding greatly to the value of the land we earnestly desire that Her Majestys Government would be pleased to lend us cash for said purpose
These with minor arrangements would avert the pending calamities
Destitution which is now staring us in the face would we believe be then unknown
If these plains could be given to the people the Highlands would once more become the home of a people who would not consider their lives too sacred for the defence of their queen and country
To the Royal  CommissionANGUS MACDONALD and DONALD MACRAE delegates
Yes
There were a great many in the church over here
I believe there are only thirtytwo heads of families in the rental
I suppose it is just mixed altogether

No there are some higher and some smaller according to the quality of the lands they have
I keep two cows and a horse
I have no sheep
I cannot graze the horse
I must buy the grazing for the horse elsewhere
Not on the croft because there are only about five acres of it arable and the rest of it peat moss and heather
It is light mossy soil
Peats were cut there before and the bottom is left there and very little surface on i t  there is a solid bottom that retains the water and it is very shallow soil
The general corn crop in this country is barley or small oats
A very poor yield indeed in our mossy ground
Last year I knew a neighbour who sowed sixteen bushels of large oats and he only raised four bushels
It all depends on the season
If the season is dry we will have some yield  but if it is wet the roots get into a mess and the corn is gone
No
I have been there three years
I was one of the parties who were put out upon common but I was fourteen years on another croft in the centre of the township and a very bad croft it was
I was very glad to get out of it
No sometimes very seldom
s and s d a day is the highest I have seen here for a good tradesman
That is what I was told perhaps there was a little of it done but it ceased to a great extent
I have seen it sometimes when all the people would turn out to the east and to the west for the cast kelp and for cutting kelp on the east side
I daresay it has been always with some of them
I have seen some worse than others every year
It is only lately
They complain lately of what has been done to them
I think the people were always on the decrease as to means
They have been coming down every year
From my own recollection and it is twentysix years since I came here they are getting worse every year
There is a great deal of that owing to the want of kelp making
I may say kelp was the sole support of the people here and although they had not a great deal of wages for doing it still the whole were turned out doing it and there were stores of meal in the country and no destitution while the kelp was going on
They would get plenty meal when they were at the kelp
It did
Yes
Well I am not sure as to the son following his father in that respect
I believe the arrears stand but one of our tenants tells me here today that he is in possession that way
Oh no it is not an ordinary practice
No I dont refer to him at all
I refer to another person
There are delegates here who were eyewitnesses
I think Angus MKinnon is one of them
No I was born on the estate of Major Fraser Kilmuir Skye
Yes sometimes
I find a living here I find a living sometimes I have sons who work away from the island
They are tradesmen too
No
Yes I work with others at jobsthat may come in the way
No there is not so much demand for carpenter work as there used to be
Yes
There was a great deal of joiner work done upon these new houses
Yes
At the time of the erection we have it but that will not continue very long
By the hour
Running between d and d or thereabouts according to the rate working ten hours a day
I suppose that will be about the figure
s a day
It was by the dayworking ten hours for s
About twentyseven years ago
Yes they have been gradually increasing
Though I got that wage I had some charge of people at the time and the others were getting s d
That was the wages generally
Yes
Yes
About thirty or thirtytwo families
The smallness of the land the dearness of the land the poor quality of the land and the difficulty of having access to pure water are the chief grievances of our township
A considerable proportion has been taken from our township
In the time of Clanranald a large proportion of the moorland was reclaimed by our  forefathers on understanding that it should remain their own land but this same ground has since been taken from us and added to the tack of Nunton both on the hill and at the macher high ground and low ground
On the portion of macher which has been cut away from us we feel more as we have to erect a dyke to keep it in proper order and to prevent our cattle straying and to keep cattle on the other side from straying on ourselves
There was a large portion of the hill ground to which we used to drive our cattle after the spring work was finished and keep them there in shielings until the time of the year when there was sufficient pasture on the old machers to support our cattle
Some of the people of their own accord on account of the exhaustion of the macher lands left those and voluntarily took up stances on their hill grounds
The land reclaimed by those settled upon the moorland was added to the tack as already mentioned and those people who had settled upon it were emigrated
The portion of the hill ground which was reclaimed and which was not added to the neighbouring tack of Nunton was peopled byabout fourteen cottars who now pay a small rent
On the machers where we have built our houses we have no pure water
It is extremely brackish and exceedingly injurious to cattle
No not of the same quality today
There was a loch which has been drained but this good water is a considerable distance from our houses the portion of land which I have already stated is occupied by a small class of cottars or tenants who pay a small rent and we find it very difficult to get access to the water
 s
 or  acres under crop
Two cows two horses and a yearold horse two stirks and five or six sheep
The rent is lower than it was at one time
 when the valuation was based upon kelp sales
About four years ago it was reduced to  s
Before Colonel Gordon bought this estatefortytwo years ago
I believe so
Yes
No
A piece of land which we also reclaimed has been settled upon a small class of tenantry who now pay rent
This piece of land was taken from my own township also a piece of our macher ground has been given to that small class of tenants in order to make potatoes
Yes about four years ago
Some from Balvannich some from different townships
Very few
More land for pasturing and for cropping
We have not had it at all events
We expect it where it is
Some have and some have not but even those who have not expend as much money in buying meal and food for their cattle as would enable them to stock a larger farm
Some earn it outside Benbecula
There are some militia men others go abroad and earn money and bring it home to help their parents
Yes a great deal worse
Both
A large proportion of themhave not
I believe they are so suffering at this present time
For many years hunger has not been so heavy in the country as at the present time
There may be some of that class in Benbecula but I cannot at present recollect any
Yes in summer time
It is flour or Indian meal or any meal which they can most cheaply purchase that is the common food of the people
We receive our meal from humane merchants but there is no doubt they charge a pretty smart price for it because some cannot recover portions of their prices
From s to  a bag or load overhead
The price of oatmeal is s per bag and if purchased in stones the price of a bag will amount to about 
I dont quite remember
It was very backward
I only made twentyseven barrels of it
I heard of people in other localities receiving portions of this money but we heard nothing about it and received none of it and we had none to enlighten us on the subject
The west coast is so very rough that there is no fishing and on the east side the fishing has been changed to Barra Head
No not any distance
A good few of the young men of Benbecula go there as well as recruits to the militia
There may be thirtythree but that is pretty much about it
They were upon a portion of the land which was added to the tack of Nunton
Nine or ten families
Yes they were draining lochs that required drainage
They were reclaiming parks for the proprietor which afforded them work and they also manufactured some brick and tile and also a little kelp
A clay work is still in operation but there are not many employed about it
There is no resident factor at the present time
There is a ground officer
I dont think so
Yes and also wanting everything that would strengthen along with the present food which they eatmeaning no beef or fish or butter or cheese
Yes
We have been reduced to poverty by their taking from us land which we ought to have
When our crofts were originally marked out grazing ground was also marked out for us as well as stances for building houses upon  but the rents were fixed at this time when kelp was selling at a high price
Part of our hill grazings and portions of macher pasture were taken from us and we received no compensation therefor
In the year
Our hill pasture for pasturing our cattle was added to a tack
The tack of Nunton
No our rent was not reduced
About  acres and sixteen souls feed upon this composed of two families
The whole croft
One half
Yes
No nothing but only the big commonty of the country and our cattle will not go on it
I have two cows and a stirk and a horse and five or six sheep
 s
More land to make us up and help us to live
I would undoubtedly be better off
I have ten of a family
In proof of my statement I am willing to produce a map showing the old march
Yes
Sure enough that is the one thing that would help us best
Over  sheep
Yes
I have been evicted and put out of my land and sustained much damage and injustice
Another tenant took my place and paid my arrears
They would not accept my arrears from myself
I and my weak family have been sent out on the peat bogs so that we are here almost exhausted
I believe I would be owing  or 
I offered the factor the best horse I had in payment of these arrears which animal subsequently fetched  at the market
The tenant who succeeded me I heard has paid   of my arrears
Roderick Steele
He is in possession now and I have been cast out on the bare hillon the bog
Freely elected
I have no written statement
It has become impossible for us to live where we are
I have been settled in heather land for the last twentyone years
I have been reclaiming this heather land as well as I can
Now I have been rented by the ground officers and before I went there this same land belonged to the people of Island Flodda
I was settled there along with three others and there was another family there before we were settled there and the land we occupied was rented at  before we were settled there
The ground officer cut off crofts for the three but the people of the Island of Flodda who formerly possessed this ground received in compensation or as favour a road to their peat mosses and also to water their cattle
The people of Island Flodda had formerly the right to the land upon which we were settled
The people of Island Flodda were rented on account of this road which was made to their peat mosse They had to pay   a piece on account of this road to their peat mosses
Instead of the  which was the original rent paid for this particular piece of groundformerly possessed by people who emigrated to Americatheir rents were raised to  when we were settled upon it
Our lands were lotted by order of the proprietor
The whole of the island of Beubecula was alloted in this way except Island Flodda and a portion of land occupied by us
A poor man from the district of Uachdar who had no land in his own particular neighbourhood was removed from the said district and four acres of my lands taken from me and given to this poor man as also a portion of road to the peat mosses formerly mentioned
I am of opinion that a proper valuation would fix the value of this same outroad at something like s annually instead of  per family according to the present charge
On account of this removal from my own holding of four acres I desire to get an equivalent of reduction in my rent but I have been refused and the former rent is still existing
We are all afflicted with the same disease
All in the same position
The country is not lotted in proper proportions and a few people may be better off than the general but only a few
Only heather
I have two cows and a twoyearold
No that is not the usual summing
According as they are able to maintain them
Some have three cows and some have four cows but it is rare to have four
I am paying  s of rent including taxes
The rent itself is  s
I have seven ewes this year
I have one horse
Yes
Some pay  some pay  and some    s
I want both but though increased how could I stock it when I am empty
Only heather ground
I will tell you that if it can be done
We have a big tack at Benbecula and I consider it the cream of the island
This one tack would improve every poor family in Benbecula and still leave enough to support in comfort the one family that presently occupies it
I mean that the one who cannot live upon his present holding should get an increase
If two or three of the present crofters on Island Flodda were removed it would relieve the pressure on those families remaining
It is so being cropped during the last eighty years continuous cropping has exhausted it
I know no other remedy
I was born in this township and lived in it for twentyseven years
Torlum
I married when I was twentyseven years of age
I myself with a friend had purchased a croft in Liniclate we remained twelve years upon that croft but we were compelled when our families increased to separate the one of us from the other and look out for some other part
We purchased the houses with the land
They call that a possession
It was the custom at the time I refer to
I did not
I received nothing for the house which I left behind me
It was promised to us but the promise was not implemented
Mr Birnie the late factor promised that I should receive the value of these houses from the incoming tenant but the incoming tenant proved to be so poor tbat he was unable to implement his promise
He was aware of it
No except by private agreement
If we come to a private arrangement the factor takes nothing to do with it
Every inch of it
 s
When I removed to Island Flodda two ground officers were ordered to measure out my piece of land and also to value it
These two ground officers valued it at    but a different factor Mr Rule said he considered it really too dear himself being a piece of wild moorland and that he would take s off leaving it  s
It includes the grazing of the cattle on the heather
No but portions of my land were taken and let to others and I still pay the former rent
Yes
Every inch of it
I believe I am left with  acres of improvable land at present
It is composed of six crofts
Nearly as many more cottars
There are at least ten heads of families but there are crofts which have three families upon them and crofts that have two
Nunton
The only one
No
Yes it will be about thirty years since there was an addition to this tack of Nunton
I remember it perfectly well
Yes some land was taken off Balvannich and the township of Aird
I may also say Uachdar
I am not aware of any more
When the tack was originally cut by the late Dr MLeod the Balvannich people were promised compensation for a piece of moorland which belonged to them before that year and which was added to the tack of Nunton
Dr MLeod
For Colonel Gordon
Yes
I cannot mention the townships but I can mention the moor
They were hiding themselves in caves and dens for fear of being removed
Scarraleod
I remember of no other place in Benbecula
I have no doubt but there may be
Yes
The statement is quite true
In my own fathers house the ground officer met the people with the paper
We signed the paper on the understanding that we ourselves would receive some compensation for the loss of this gusset but against our will for we would have much preferred the gusset to any consideration we might receive and the man who was formerly examined is an occupier of the same gusset though he said he knew nothing about it
He is paying rent for it
We got no reduction
About five or six years ago
Twentyfive years ago
I have half a croft
Yes Smerclet South Uist May   My Lords and Gentlemen The troubles that we are getting here are just the want of land
The land that our fathers had is divided among two or three persons
The way that our fathers were paying the land was working on cut kelp but these are gone away now and there is nothing now wanting on us but the money  although the cut kelp stopped the rent is still the same it is not getting low but still rising higher
It is not a wonder that we are poor although we would be working the pay would be Is d a day till two or three years when it rose higher
The land that our fathers and grandfathers had for the cattle we cannot now let them on or else they are locked up and pounded by farmers
Some two or three years before the people from her Ladyship would come and they would take away the cattle that we would be going to sell and would give to us for these what would please themselves and we would not know what they did
Although we have cattle it is not our own but it belongs to the person who is giving us food
This person is Mr Donald Fergusson and if he will it till he is paid and the rest of it to the governor we will have nothing
The bad way that they were governing us before this were the governor took some meal to this country and a person had to work for a whole day on roads and trenches with spades for one pound of meal
Poorrate money and school money are taken from us along with the rent every year and we do know what they are doing with it and they are still getting higher
We have very bad land here but it is worse just now as the water of the mill is making a great damage to it and the rent is still the same
After all things if we would get plenty of land and the rent as they shall see better at any price but not on the price of a factor or a governorSMERCLEIT CROFTERS
Twelve crofts
There are two families for each of these crofts and one or two outside on the moor
Yes
I have been freely elected a representative to appear here
Yes
My father always paid his rent by kelp and he never had any occasion to buy any meal for food
We ourselves manufactured the kelp
We never sold a pound but to the proprietor
According to the weight delivered over to the proprietor so much per ton
 s  and sometimes   per ton for kelp
I think the proprietrix does not care to continue this kelp manufacture because it does not pay
I believe that latterly the price fell very much so that she was realising little if anything for the sale of kelp and therefore it was discontinued
I have been working some days and receiving s d
I remember when there were only twelve crofts and twelve crofters families in the whole township of Smercleit and they were then well off
Yes
Only twelve
Perfectly sure
Yes
There are lads along with me here from whom cattle were taken the other year and they ought to tell what they got for them
John MMillan and Roderick MCaskill
They were valued at Askernish
I dont think it was much under the market price
The proprietor
Yes both
In the year of the potato failure
He said he would do his best to put that right and he has helped us to some extent since he promised
If that is mentioned in the paper the paper is not right
Who can or will settle it except the factor
I am sure the Royal Commission will not assist me in fixing the rent and therefore we must go to the factor
 s
Three cows and horses
I have one stirk and a calf
One
I believe my share of the croft is about  or  acres
Very little can be afforded to be left
We are constantly turning it
I plant nine or ten barrels and take none out
In a very good year I might take out forty barrels as the result of planting nine or ten
I sow about four or five barrels of seed oats and I dont fill these barrels again at the end of the season when threshing them out
I get hold of a little of the barley
A storm carried off the land altogether but in ordinary years I have more return from the barley than from the oats
Three or four bushels
About two bags of grain
Yes
No
Altogether for the sake of the straw
I believe it could not be worse
Yes always  over sixty years in the same township
We are constantly growing poorerthree times poorer than in my earliest recollection
I have nothing to eat unless I get it from these merchants at Loch Boisdale
Yes when my father had a croft for himself he never bought a pound of meal and in those days the potatoes would be in heaps
No not half
They cannot be very happy when they are hungry
When I was young I would get more milk than I would drink
Today we cannot get a mouthful at all many of us
Because they havent it
The few eggs they have they sell for tea and that is the substitute for milk
That is my answer
Yes it is quite true of those in my position
I am certain that it is
When I was young no one had to leave the country to labour
Instead of going south they used to labour at kelp at home  but now in the absence of that industry they are obliged to run away to the east country or wherever they can get employment
Not so numerous as today
They are much more numerous today than they were then
Yes
The prices are decidedly better than they used to be
I dont think the milk is even so plentiful to give to calves as it was in those days
Just sojust on account of the want of grassno grass at all
Yes
Yes
Yes Garranamony South Uist May   My Lord and Gentlemen in the first place Garranamony crofters try their best to work their land but it is impossible for them to take their supply out of it
Now the only thing we want is to get more land if we could get  it
We have seen Garranamony with sixteen crofters and it is now divided among twentysix
Some of them possess about two acres just now and taxes are rising higher every year
It is impossible for us to work the small piece of land we have got because we have never got a road made through the town
The land was rented first when the kelp was as high as    s per ton
There is no kelp made in this country since several yearsbut little of it last yearand the rent is as high as it was before
The people here are keeping little of stock but the most
Twentysix
Over
No
It is a township to the south of this
The larger number present in the township today have been shifted from other places cleared for tacks
In Glen Corriedale
On the tack presently occupied by the Rev
Mr Macdonald who is here today
Murdoch MLennan who came from Harris to Milton
I was about eight years of age when my father left but I dont recollect very well  think however it would be between  and   a year
 s d for a half croft
I believe he would be paying about   or 
I believe it will be thirtyseven years ago
In Bay Harstabrach to the south of Loch Boisdale
I was sometimes on British coasters and also fishing
I cannot tell the man himself is here
What I have specially to say is that I want land
There is no land in the country that we can get until we go and break up the tacks
The nearest tack is Kilbride tenanted by Mr Robert Fergusson
But it was not from that tack that my father was turned out
I would return tomorrow if I were permitted to the land my father had
I would not give a snuff for the land which I presently occupy if I were permitted to return to the land which my father tenanted
Uishnish or Glen Corriedale
My grandfather also and my predecessors from time immemorial
I am
I am clear
I have no arrears and I never was in arrears
I not only can pay debts but I can take land as well if I can get it
I have four cows and three horses  but I wish it to be understood that these are not kept upon the croft which is worth  s d in the year but they are fed upon lands belonging to some other persons
Yes
There are eightyfour paying rent in our island
Three occupied it formerly
Yes
There will be about a dozen families who pay no rentchiefly paupers
So far as I know the biggest rent is  and the lowest is as low as s
Four or five cows two or three small cattle two horses and between ten and twelve sheep
He may have a cow  I dont know of any more
Yes that is my complaint
There are three times the number on that island that should be on it
Yes people complain that they pay too high rent
Yes generally there are two families residing upon each small bit of croft
About thirtyfive or thirtysix years ago
They came from the opposite side of the ground
They were sent across to the island
From Uist
If they had any livelihood it is that which should be done
The place which they left is still there under cattle and sheep where they were making a good living
Mr Robert Fergusson
Kilbride
It is very suitable for fishing and crofting
A share of the present population of the island came from as far north as Benmore and as far south as the island of Boreray
The soil has become exhausted through continuous as cropping and where we are now workiug is nothing but rock and the other places are bogs ditches aud big rocks
I think we might make a livelihood if one crofter today had the land of three
They are doing their best generally
No if the arrears or debt upon the island were paid it would take all its present stock to do so
If we had means to enable us to stock the land as I suggested people would prefer working on the land to fishing
The fish has deserted the place
The people think if they had plenty of land and means of stocking it that they would be well
We dont know anything about that
Yes
Yes
Except two or three families
Yes
They always go to the east coast fishing
They mostly return back next winter except a few young men who go abroad in ships
Yes young women go south to work
Some of them remain away and some of them return
I dont know of any family who left our place at all
I dont know what is their reason for not going
I have half a croft
I dont know
I was often abroad and if I had scope to work at home in a way that would be satisfactory I would prefer being at home to being abroad
I was round the coast of Scotland generally and in England Ireland and America
As a sailor
If I had means of satisfactorily keeping the place at home there is no other place where I would be so healthy and happy
We dont know where that place is
Yes
I believe it is between  and
I dont know
There was one Macdonald one Fergussou and one Cameron
I am not aware
The population just consisted of the families of those three tenants with a few shepherds and herds
I dont think there would be so many
The peats are wellnigh exhausted altogether
In two or three years more there will be none
In some places
They were often complaining that there was such a surplus population on the island that they could not live
I am not aware there was any special request made by the people to remove the surplus population
I did hear so and we are very much in need of her assistance
We did not do so we are but a poor lot of people without any scholar among us to do that much for us although we have got a school
Yes
Yes
No not always
There was a Free Church school in the island before they built the public school
Almost all the population except the young children who are at school cannot read nor write
A few about my own time of life perhaps got a little education but very few
They are compelled to do so
Yes
Yes
Yes they think it dear
d in the poundd on the landlord and d on the tenant
We know it is
The great majority are fishermen
Fishing has been very backward for a few years back and people are now in great debt
I dont know the amount of arrears but I am sure they are deep in debt to the merchant with whom they deal for their food
The one who has been keeping them up for a number of years if he chose to force paymant the most of the present stock would belong to him
He is a merchant both there and on this side Mr Fergusson
They would not care about going abroad if they could live at home and get restored to the places where they came from
I am not aware there is anything different from what I have said
I was inducted into this parish in the year
I belong to the neighbouring island of North Uist
I was brought up there
I have jotted down a few notes on the subject
Having observed in one of the Inverness newspapers that it is the desire of the Royal Commission on Highland Crofters to get from the northern clergy a statement of their opinion regarding the matters which form the subject of the Commissions present investigation it occurred to me that I should jot down a few remarks giving my views whatever they may be worth on this important but difficult question
It is I may state with considerable hesitation arising from very great distrust in my own competency that I venture to undertake this task
This reluctance does not however result from want of familiarity with the subject for I had ample opportunities for the last forty years of being acquainted with the state of the crofter population of the Long Island district of the county of Inverness
Before entering on the subject proper of this paper let me remark that I have come long ago to tue deliberate conclusion and that it is now a settled conviction with me that the Highland crofter in days gone by as a rule was not in that condition of ease and comfort in which sentimental enthusiasts often portray him
True I have heard old men as far back as fortyfive years ago talk of the days of their youth fifty years or more previously than these and with the propensity of all old men to say that the former days were better and depicting those bygone days in strains which almost rivalled the poetic description of the golden age of the world yet in the course of the narrative gleams of stern historic truth showed the true state of matters  the expressive terms a hard year a hard summer when men lived on fish whelk shellfish roots of the ground lean mutton to the almost compete exclusion of bread told truly how much the imagination of those men had to do with the rosecoloured descriptions of the years of their youth
But the present state of matters is the difficulty which requires to be dealt with
Let us first consider the character of the Highland crofter
From the amount of sympathy expressed for the crofter and the tones of pity in which he is spoken of a stranger to the facts would be apt to believe that he is a poor wretched babyish weakling a savage of a low type requiring to be treated like the natives of Tasmania or Australia for fear they perish from inaction and want of vitality off the face of the earthpeople who ought to be cherished and nursed like children during the period of their nonage
A hundred fields of battle cry aloud with indignation in condemnation of such absurd ideas
Their noble qualities as soldiers their endurance under want and hardship their unsurpassed bravery their noble deeds deeds of heroism their selfdevotion to duty need not be dwelt upon here are they not written in the chronicles of every campaign where Britons have most distinguished themselves
Moreover everybody who knows them will admit that they are a sharpwitted keen shrewd intelligent race
Inspectors of schools tell us that Highland school boys under the disadvantage of having to cultivate their intelligence through the medium of a foreign language compare favourably with bys in other parts of the country who are not so  handicapped and let me add and I trust with pardonable pride that hitherto Highlanders have been a decent honest wellbehaved contented and loyal people
But admitting all this what about their industrial habits
It is allowed that in strength and activity the Highlanders are inferior to few if any of the other races of the nation and that they are capable in certain circumstances of powerful and strenuous exertion
But the virtue of perseverance in their undertaking is denied them and while it is granted that they can put on a violent spurt and can work at a pinch with any yet it is said that they are not given to constant continuous work and that by the very constitution of their nature they are not fitted for the strain of longenduring and sustained labour
That this allegation has any foundation in fact I could never bring myself to believe and for any grain of apparent truth there may be in it their circumstances may account
During the season of spring and harvest no people work harder or more continuous they are at it late and early but in the inclement season of a long winter with the short dark clays with almost constant storms and blinding rain one can easily understand how little can be done during that time in such adverse circumstances
But place them under more favourable conditions and with more adequate inducements and I am very much mistaken if they will fail to work steadily industriously and continuously all the year round
Then what is the quality of the land on which they have to work
I believe it is a common opinion founded on the dearbought experience of farmers that agricultural farms have not been paying for the last few years even on the best of lands and I have no doubt it will be conceded that on the majority of West Highland estates with few if any exceptions cropmaking does not pay
The land is poor hungry and ungrateful and even if well cultivated which often it is not it would give but a poor return for the labour bestowed upon it
The system that seems to succeed best is to have some cropping land with an outrun of grazing attached
This complex system is the only one suited to the Highlands
The grazing land enables a man to keep a few sheep the crop besides feeding his family for a certain period enables him to winter his cattle and keep more of tbemto keep a pair of ponies which are indispensable especially to an Uist farmer who attempts to raise a crop
In short it is difficult to see how a man without a certain amount of grazing land can subsist within the four corners of even a large croft
But how much land should support a family
What should be the size of a croft
There can be no hesitation I think in asserting that a small croft of four five or even six acres cannot support a family independent of any other resources
Nay I heard it stated and I partly believe it that such a croft would not support a family even if it were rent free
There was a time within the recollection of living men when an ordinarysized croft would suffice for a family
But that was a time when a population that supported only three or four shops now supports forty or fifty and their men and women manufactured their own linen and cloth when the men instead of paying s or upwards for boots there are no shoes used made their own shoes of their own hometanned leather and when there was no kind of tea
I do not wish to speak in a censorious or sarcastic manner of my Highland fellowcountrymen I do not wish to call them extravagant or luxurious they are not so
But I want to call attention to the broad palpable fact of the incompatibility between the small crofters income and his expenditure on things which have before now become necessaries of life
I do not envy the man who would grudge the crofter and his family their tea and sugar with their bread and butter
That they use more tea than is good for them and that of an inferior quality is alleged
I do not know as to this but it is believable
Moreover I fancy that there are few except stringent total abstainers that would grudge the Highlander living in this moist climate an occasional dram but they are not drinkers of whisky
Young men may occasionally take what is vulgarly called a  spree at weddings markets and formerly but not now at funerals and like all men of Celtic idiosyncrasies get very much excited and make a great noise
But as a class Highland crofters to my certain knowledge are a sober lot
Under this head it is obvious to remark that in many cases the present size of crofts is not what they were at one time or at all events what they were intended to be
Whether they were as is alleged encroached upon by the ruling powers of a property or whether subdivided by the crofters themselves the practical result is the same
The great wit Sidney Smith is said to have stated that there is one precept in New Testament which the clergy on the north of the Tweed literally obeyed
Taken bought for your raiment
The working classes of all countries and Highlanders in particular are said to be in the habit of giving implicit obedience to a much older command Be fruitful and multiply  and replenish the earth and subdue it   the latter clause however not being so strictly complied with The subject of early and imprudent marriages is an old theme frequently commented on
But as it was in the days before the flood men were marrying and given in marriage so it is likely to continue to the end of time  and no doubt it is for the good of the world and mankind that it should bo so  but it is but a commonplace remark to say that when a man enters into that state without a fair prospect of being able to provide for his familyor when as is said it results in squatting down as a cottar or leads to the subdivision of crofts from that point of view it is an admitted evil
Whether proprietors might and should have a quantity of reserved land out of which to slice croft after croft for young married couples as they required them is I fear a Utopian idea and whether such a scheme if adopted would eventually succeed in benefiting the country is I fear also more than problematical
The condition of the crofter has been always in a great many instances a hard one
The history of many an honest hardworking man is as follows
A man marries a wife enters upon a croft stocks it to a certain extent begins to cultivate it singlehanded for a croft cannot bear the burden of hired labour at the present rate of wages but like a brave man he struggles on alone keeping a stout heart against a steep brae tries to pay his rent and keep the wolf from the door until after a while his family grow up about him begin to get strong and very materially to help him
He finds himself now in comparatively easy circumstances and continues to be so until his family begin to leave him one after the other until the last one goes and the old couple are left alone in the feebleness of their old age they begin to get poor again
So that if he has not had the ability or prudence to lay up something for a rainy day the last state of that man is worse than the first
This is not an imaginary case but one of frequent occurrence
The great question is where is the remedy for the evil
Whatever may be the extent of the evil complained of by crofters there is no doubt of its being a crying evil
I forgot who said  For every evil under the sun there is a remedy or there is none
If there is a remedy try to find it  if there is none never mind it
But this evil of poverty about which there is such an outcry cannot be let alone and cannot be ignored
There appears to be a felt need and to meet this need more lands must be given to the crofters according to their own unanimous verdict and this no doubt seems a very feasible way of meeting the difficulty but this cure like every other cure requires means and appliances and the means in this case must be money and in the great majority of cases money given ab extra for the crofters declare they have none and in a vast number of cases their declaration is true so that without this external aid the giving of more lands would seem a good purpose in the case of those only who are pretty welltodo already and those most in need of help are left where they were
The giving of more lands then entails the indispensable concomitant of giving money to stock and work it
How to obtain this money for the use of crofters is a problem the solution of which has not been hinted at in any suggestion of a practical nature which has come within my knowledge
I am of opinion speaking of the Long Island and especially of the two Uists with which I am better acquainted that the most is not made of the land which the crofters already hold
There is no attempt at cropping by rotation and consequently the land has ceased to yield the returns which under a better system of tiUage might be fairly expected
There is scarcely an attempt at improving their crofts by clearing or draining or in any way whatsoever the excuse given being the uncertainty of their tenure as tenants from year to year which excuse should be removed by giving the crofters leases of their holdings
Late sowing is another evil which is a great loss to crofters and this is caused by the unfenced state of the crofts
Many of them allege that they would sow earlier but what would be the use as long as the horses and cattle of a whole township have free access to roam over the tilled land trampling and poaching the ground and even cropping the young braird after it has fairly sprung  Tillage is thus continued till far on in June the crops consequently have no time to ripenmust often be cut greenis exposed to the storms at the end of harvest of course the yield of meal in unripe corn is inconsiderable is scarcely fit for anythiug better than provender for cattle and such as it is is exposed at this stage also in its unprotected state to the ravages of cattle badly herded and hungry horses of which too many are often kept which no tethering can effectually secure
The value of those lands would be vastly increased by being properly enclosed
Then their grazing lands are but poorly utilised for the common good
According to the present system every man is his own shepherdevery man has his own lugmark  each man his own collie dog with which he goes to the hill any idle day he has to spare and for little or no purpose except to disturb not only his own sheep but those of his neighbours
The consequence is that one may have forty or fifty sheep while others have few or none
A club stockwith one lugmark one shepherd one uniform system of managementwould secure evenhanded justice to those concerned the stock of sheep would undoubtedly thrive better and would be a sure source of income to every man concerned
Lands so managed would no doubt result in increase of means and lead to improvement of comfort
Already there is a taste for finer clothing and what is thought to be a more comfortable way of living in general and along with other improvements the black thatched cottage which by the way is not always the comfortless abode a stranger may fancy would soon give way to a more civilisedlooking dwelling
But after all that can be said or done land being a limited quantity and the increase of population proceeding with rapid strides it is evident that a time must come when people will see the necessity of moving of their own accord from a country which must eventually become crowded to some place where there is more ample room and better scope and better remuneration for energy and persevering industry
And if they shovdd resolve to sever the tie which knits them to their native land let them not be advised to migrate to the south country and settle down in large towns when although many a north country man has thriven and succeeded in life yet where many a poor Highland family had to descend to an underground cellar a sad change to those accustomed to the free air of heaven and when the surroundings are anything but favourable to the growth of the higher and better nature of their offspring
Let it be emigration then but even to emigration one feels many objections it deprives the land of its best inhabitantswe lose the bone and sinew of the country and considering the violent wrench required to enable a Highlander to tear himself from his native rocks one has not the heart to advise them to leave
Yet there is a conflict between ones feeling and judgmentbetween the head and the heart and what I state here publicly is what I have told my Highland fellowcountrymen in privatethat however unwilling to part with them should rather hear of their comfort and happiness and welfare in a far country than to see them poor and complaining in their native homes  and whether they are to leave now or a distant date depends upon what may be done now to better their condition
Yes I saw that and I thought I would just jot down a few remarks
I think they partake in the general progress of the country and that compared with the former state of the Highland tenantry they are not as a rule worse off excepting such years as this when there is destitution or some particular cause for their not being so well off as they normally are
Yes that is true in many cases
I have no doubt that their holdings are very often too small and that the land gets exhausted in consequence of their being obliged to turn it over every year
Yes I have not the slightest doubt in giving an affirmative answer to that
Yes
Well that is a very difficult thing to say
No doubt many of the crofters require more lands but those who require more lands are those who are least able to take larger crofts
I think it would be very difficult to bring influence upon them to emigrate
I think that such is the good feeling between the Highland crofters and their children that children would have less objection to emigrate provided they thought they would have a chance of leaving their parents comfortable
I dont think it has very much
I think they are just as healthy and moral as people who are better housed
Yes
Yes excellent crops
Yes
I believe Barra is an earlier part of the country and I believe if there was one year left lea it would not do to sow it very early but of course twenty days after this I would consider out of the question altogether
Yes
Well they are very conservative in their way and not apt to change their mode of tillage
I have stated in that paper a few things which would be improvements
It has been often asked of a man who is a good farmer  Why dont you sow earlier
I cannot sow earlier he says until a certain time the cattle and horses are not removed
I believe so to a very great extent
Yes
Yes
That is so but we had an auditing of the accounts every year and if anybody wanted a sight of them we would give them the MS
Yes of course we did not circulate copies
Yes it would be an improvement and I suppose we shall adopt it
No I dont think them so at all
I think in a case of sickness there ought to be some means of isolating the sick person from the other members of the family which is not always easily done in the case of many of these huts
s d between landlord and tenant
d and d each
No
No not very perceptibly not to any great extent
It has been much about the same thing for the last few years
My understanding is that this property has been of very little use to the present proprietrix that she was paying nearly the whole rent and laying it out in work and that the returns from it to Lady Gordon Cathcart had been very trifling indeed
Perhaps I am not a judge of that but there have been roads and steamboat piers and hotels such as this and the one in Barra which are calculated to improve the property
Well of course the crofters were employed at all those public works and of course it was for their benefit that it should be so
I would pity the proprietor who had to do with this property under its present circumstances that is to say if he was a poor proprietor and I think it is very fortunate for the people that they have a rich proprietor who I believe is very anxious to improve their condition
Well what might be called prosperity fifty or a hundred years ago
I believe the people were comfortable and contented
Yes
We were not so celebrated as Skye for that but we sent a lot of good soldiers
Yes we considered them so
Yes especially the number of men
Yes
It is as follows Statement of the Tenants of South Boisdale
Before two Frobosts and Kildonans people were removed we were better off than we are at present as we were overcrowded by them
We suffered by their coming among us and they suffered as much by being forced to come and their holdings given to tacksmen
There are nineteen crofts in South Boisdale and there are twentynine families on the nineteen
Six cottars are on our common ground  two of them pay some rent to the factor though we are under their damage
Four paupers have houses along with them and they are very destructive to our crops besides what they have of our land
The common ground was our best arable land we took it in ourselves and improved it
The rest of our land is very stony excepting bits of macher we have
So it was from the common ground we would get the best of our crop in potatoes and corn and grazing were it not for them aforesaid destroying it
About thirty years ago Boisdale was lotted longways  nine of our crofts was cut across and put in a lot to Boisdale
We got a gusset of land for what we lost though not half so good but five or six years afterwards the ground officer came to us with a paper to sign to clear ourselves of that gusset and he said  Any of you that will refuse to sign will be removed
We were promised a reduction in rent We signed for fear of being removed but no reduction as yet
There is no fishing of any kind going on in our township
We all depend on the land and in a bad year of this kind on Messrs D
Ferguson  Co  and were it not for them the most of us must have starved this year and his account will show so
If all our debt was paid very few of us would be left a horse and a cow of his own
A few years ago we were forced to make potatoes for the proprietor for fear of vengeance we submitted
The people of four townships made them on our peat ground
That park is out of crop this year and the grazing let to two men unknown to the rest and we consider that unfair as the whole township stands in need of it
Our rent was not raised only we lost the good of our common ground but we consider our rent too high by cash as this place was rented when kelp was in demand with a promise to reduce it if comes any failure in the kelp
Kelp is of no use now and it is very little work of any kind that is to pay anything
If South Boisdale was tenanted as formerly one tenant on each croft and the common ground clear as it was twentyeight years agowith the liberty our forefathers have had on the hillpasture and the rent reduced or the kelp raised to the price it was drawing when the land was rented according to the price of kelp we would be better off than we are
At last Martinmas there was a general change to be on the crofters  but Mr Macdonald the chief factor gave us the situation we have
He said as the township was so small and the people so numerous and land so scarce that he would let us be as we were though there is land which our forefathers have had in Uist
But within five months afterwards the ground officer marked out a piece of our common ground to a cottar
When we saw the promise broken in such a short time we gathered together and told the cottar to stop work on our land for two days till we would get the case settled at the factors but he did not heed us
That shows the cottars have more liberty than the tenants but we know why because they are only troubling the poor tenants
We pay very high for poor rates and school dues
We will get notice very clever now how much is to pay but no account of how that money is used
I came first from Kildonan to North Boisdale and then I left that and went to South Boisdale
My father was evicted from Kildonan
I have been in South Boisdale for thirtythree or thirtyfour years
 s
It has not been changed on me
Yes
I wish to explain that my son is with me on the croft I have two cows and a horse and a twoyearold heifer and my son has also a cow and a horse
We have four cows between us and two horses
I have four sheep myself and my son has none
By continuous cropping the land is getting so very thin and poor and the ground being rocky the soil is being gradually washed away from those rocks into the Atlantic
Our grazing is very much circumscribed now owing to the settling of so many squatters upon these lands
I am told they pay   or s to the proprietor
They dont keep any cattle beasts unless they have a few sheep but these are equally troublesome to us
Through our township
Two crofts
Only a small pieceabout an acre each
Their consent was not asked
No I know nothing about it
I have heard nothing about a paper
Donald MPhie He is here today
I know it was the ground officer that pointed out that piece of land for this new settler
I know nothing about the paper
A merchant in South Loch Boisdalethe one who kept alive all the people in the country this year
Yes half of a big bag
Flour
We could get better quality
No I dont know
There is a portion of the people so poor that they must buy the cheapest food
I believe only s of difference between the one and the other
Baking it with soda
Only when we have oatmeal
We take barley meal porridge also when we have it
The children get baked flour and tea
Because we have no milk or anything else to givethem but tea  and it is with hen eggs that we are purchasing the tea and sometimes the tea is black without sugar or cream
Three shillings a pound
Yes and often we are obliged to go for tea when we have no eggs to bring with us
Yes
Yes
I was myself engaged on that land and carrying seaware on my back to it
In South Boisdale
Land belonging to our own township
Yes
It was on her behalf so far as I know
Yes
Yes
We were paid for our work
I dont remember exactly to the penny what I got but I was paid
I believe it would be about eight acres
There was no crop last year
It was white crop the year before and left out
The grazing of it is given for money value to some people
Yes it is part of the lands of our township
Yes
Yes
Yes
We had a great reason to complain
About forty years ago there were twentyfour crofters in this village and now it is situated on fortyeight with heavy families
In the month of September the most of our crop will be destroyed with heavy floods owing to the leading drains being closed up more than twenty years ago
Also the west side that we called the Macher are exhausted and going with the wind which cannot be made up without the help of the landlord
The hill pasture that we had for grazing our cattle horses and sheep if we would have any are now situated on six or seven tenants
And when we will go out to our grazing place they are drilling them back with their dogs
The property that we have does not belong to ourselves it belongs to the men who supply us with food and clothing and the reason that we are in the heavy debts is this that our land is exhausted with the number of the people
And about fortysix years ago we used to sell plenty of graiu and potatoes besides keeping up our own families and the place where that was growing is now filled up with Cheviot and oxen
We are now kept so far behind that we will no get leave to keep the littlest dog about our houses
Then we are paying so much taxes for poorrates school and road taxes and we never get an account of what they were doing with it and therefore the new alteration that they are expecting to do on this village instead of improving us would make us worse than ever
When the kelp was at a high price this land was rented according to that and since a couple of years ago the kelp stopped and the rent is as high as ever
About thirty years ago the late Colonel Gordon offered the third part of the rent down to them that would pay ready cash for it and the rest never got the same chance again
We are in great need of help and wishing to get more land for the future
Twentyfour
Some making up the fortyeight do not belong to the township at all but are squatted outside of it
Some of them are five years and some four years there
From about Loch Boisdale here some people who had no lands
One was a sailor and he got lands there another occupied a croft further out and he was changed
Yes they pay rent to the proprietor
Yes
Because he had no lands elsewhere for them
They were natives
Not to the same township
Some of them had lands in South Loch Boisdale and they were dispossessed and settled there
Others were natives and had no lands at all  young people who set up house there
Yes
We are complaining of their presence there because our cattle when they are sent out are chased by dogs and sent back again by those squatters
Yes
To give them some other places and clear them out of there
Our township has no room for them
We were often complaining to the factor but not at the particular time when these were squatted down
They are not relatives
They are not related to the people of the township
The rent of my croft is  s and s of poorrates
My stock is not large
I have only two cows and a horse
I have five or six sheep
I have one calf
No
They would keep four cows two horses three or four young cattle and some six or seven sheep
Yes
Want of money is the cause
My children married and left me and there is only my wife and myself
Very little
It would not amount to an acre per familyall that is left of our hill pastures now
On our arable crofts
On the crofts 
When I said  s that was the rent of the croft
Six cows two horses and a young horse
Not much more unless a few followers
I dont know
Ten
None only my wife
Seventyfive or seventysix
They didnt leave the country
Some of them married in my own neighbourhood
No I have never troubled any of them very much yet
The land is too dear in consequence of the change of value in kelp
Thirtyfour or thirtyfive years ago
Yes
About fortythree years ago
Yes
Yes some from my township
Some of them went of their own accord
I came to my present lands as one of those families who were evicted
Frobost
I dont know of any in North Boisdale who in consequence of the removal got more land than they had
I was paying it all formerly
I dont pay it in full now
I am unable to pay
All in North Boisdale are back in condition on account of so many people being squatted upon them
My father was never in North Boisdale
In Frobost
He paid six guineas in Frobost
He was in a pretty good position
Three sons and three daughters
Yes
Yes maintaining a family and paying more than that
Always selling on account of the land
I was never engaged to labour outside of the country
I earned it through the country
While at Frobost I kept six or seven cows on my own account
One particular thing which I would like to receive assistance for is to make some improvements upon the parts of the shore where the seaware is gathered for the use of our lands
Improvements were formerly made but these have now fallen through and we would like assistance outside ourselves to improve this
To place large stones here and there so that drift ware would grow upon them
We need it from whatever source it comeswhether from the proprietrix or anybody else but we cannot do it ourselves
There seems to be land near the shore separated by a narrow channel and I could wish this channel blocked up so that the sea ware would be caught in it
Yes
The following is an exact statement of part of the grievances and hardbhps of us the crofters of Kilphedar
We have suffered much injustice during upwards of the last forty years through having been deprived of a great extent of hill pasturage by Dr MLeod the then factor of Colonel Gordon for which he promised us compensation meaning a reduction of our rent
At the following Whitsunday he was expelled from the office of factorship without fulfilling his promise
We claimed the compensation from the succeeding factor but was refused saying that he would not make any alteration in the books but leave them in the same way in which he found them
We claimed the compensation from every succeeding factor with the same result
There are over forty crofters and cottars located on the land deprived from us as above mentioned upwards of forty years ago while we pay the same rent yet without any reduction whatever
There were twentythree crofts in this township at first the rent was raised on account of the ware being growing at both ends of our land suitable for making kelp but kelp making has ceased by which we paid our rent but the rent remains as it was formerly
We have suffered many injustices while we were making the kelp viz we were every third year for ten years compelled to leave our own kelp stance to others who were destroying our grass and corn while we had to go to tacksmens lands to make kelp after being there all summer the case generally was that we would not make as much kelp as would pay the grazing of our horses while nothing was allowed to ourselves for any loss we sustained through those who were making kelp on our own lands
We were not allowed to keep a dog though we would pay licence for it
Our sheep were chased and gathered to a certain place called a fault by the ground officer constables and other helpers through the order of the factor in order to see if any crofter had more than ten sheep which was the number allowed for us to keep however high the rent of the croft might be if it happened that any person had more than the above number he was obliged to buy grazing from a neighbour short of the above number the reason for that was and still is that we were deprived of our former hill pasturage which we claim and trust to get possession of yet
Ground officer and constables used to come two or three days before the markets day to our houses marking our stock which was ready for the market compelling us to drive them to the factors house so as to avoid us the freedom of selling them at the market ourselves
We were obliged to make potato parks to the proprietrix on our rented land which we cultivated from mere wild moor with crooked and common spades carrying the whole of the manure on our backs where horses could not walk that being done without any abatement of rent
These parks are fenced the grazing of which is let to the highest bidder
Our peats stance has been taken from us to make room for crofters and cottars where they have a miserable living
If we complain of being overcrowded the factors answer is  There is no room for the people in the country
Yes there is plenty for twice or thrice as many from where others were driven and compelled to emigrate to America some of whom had been tied before our eyes others hiding themselves in caves and crevices for fear of being caught by authorised officers
There is twice or thrice as much waste arable land in South Uist as there is under cultivation
Our land is so inferior in quality that it will not yield oneeighth part of a years allowance for our families
We are thus under the necessity of buying from Glasgow seveneighths of a years allowance of our victuals and that of the most inferior quality such as Indian meal and the cheapest groceries also our clothing for want of sheep and competent holding
As there is plenty of arable land in the country not used or cultivated we want as much of it both of arable and hill pasturage as will support our families comfortably and that at a reasonable rent with security that we shall not be removed from our holdings as long as we can pay rent for it
We never appealed to Lady Cathcart for the above grievances but repeatedly to her representatives without any result
Fortytwo families
They are all paying rent
No
None now
Thirtyeight years ago
It belongs to the crofters of North Loch Boisdale here
A whole croft
I have no knowledge of acres at all
I have three cows one twoyearold three stirks one horse four sheep one pig
 s
No not increased
In the same way
If we get what was taken from us
Our peat banks were taken from us and other parks that have been especially enclosed by the proprietrix have also been taken from us and we have no common grazing
I can only answer for myself
I would be satisfied if I got an equal portion of land elsewhere but I would prefer to get what belonged to us originally
No land lying suitably adjacent to our present holding
Perhaps a very few of them may for a few days obtain grazing from the tacksmen in order to put their cattle into a condition for market
We give days of labourmaking hay stacks in harvest time
He is not very hard upon us
We were very much better off in food and clothing when I was young
When I was a young man I would complain very much of the food I take today
We had butter cheese flesh potatoes and meal of which we cannot today partake and plenty of them of which today there is very little
I am almost ashamed to tell you
We have tea and eggs and sometimes not sufficient milk to put into our tea and sometimes not sufficient sugar
I will tell the truth
I have a little bread but only a little
If I would take the advice of the ground officer I would not have even that little food today
The ground officer told me that if he had known I had applied to the local factor for seed corn he would have prevented me getting it because I trespassed in ploughing some bit of land beyond the orders of the ground officer
Yes
About five years ago
No value
Yes
I could make four or five tons of kelp myself for which I would get from  to  s a ton
That kept me from getting into arrears and also helped me to buy food but now that source of income has gone
They are not quite so foolish nowadays as they were when I was young
The struggle for existence is too strong for them now
No
Oh no they have not given up songs
No
I do not think the Free Church clergyman near me is caring much about music or dancing or songs
He is an exception
I never heard any of my own priests object if we behaved ourselves about it
No I never heard that the parish minister objected to anything of the kind and I dont know whether he is or is not present here today but he is a good friend to the country
Yes
Yes
Partly natural increase and partly some of those that were dispossessed of the lands at Frobost as already spoken of
Nine
Yes
The cottars spoil our peat moss
They converted it into arable land where we used to cut our peats
Yes
Yes
They are valued and that value is paid by those who are able to pay for it in the township
No we were paid for reclaiming it
We were receiving s for reclaiming a space that was containing a barrel of seed potatoes
Yes
It is two years since it ceased
No they were valued on the home farm at Askernish afterwards
The animals were carried away and afterwards valued on the farm of Askernish
Some were marked by the proprietor but left in the possession of the original holders who went afterwards to market with them and got better prices than for those that were delivered over and valued
If we got good value it mattered not to us
Two tacksmenMr MLeod and Mr Fergusonwere the valuators
Yes they did complain
Mr Macdonald did nothing wrong to us since he became factor over us but what was wrong before
He merely followed out the old customs
I believe that is right
I heard and saw portions of it
I saw a policeman chasing a man down the macher towards Askernish with a view to catch him in order to send him on board an emigrant ship lying in Loch Boisdale
I saw a man who lay down on his face and nose on a little island hiding himself from the policeman and the policeman getting a dog to search for this missing man in order to get him on board the emigrant ship
Lachlan Macdonald
Donald Smith
The dog did not discover him but the man was afterwards discovered all the same
He had got into the trench of a lazy bed
He was taken off
Just the same way
A man named Angus Johnston whose wife gave birth to three children and another child was dead before he was seized and tied upon the pier of Loch Boisdalc  and it was by means of giving him a kick that he was put into the boat and knocked down
The old priest interfered and said  What arc you doing to this man
Let him alone
It is against the law
The four children were dead in the house when he was caught and tied and knocked down by a kick and put on board
Yes no doubt
I myself had charge of a squad of men working on a road when Mr Chisholm and Murdoch MLennan wished me to go to Loch Eynort to bring people out of their homes to be sent out in an emigrant ship
Just tacksmen in the country with the view of clearing the country for themselves
The office does not belong to me
I am in charge of a squad of men working upon these roads paid by the proprietor
I have nothing to do with searching houses or taking men out of them
If you have constables send them
They went away and sent other constables after that
A brother also went away at the same time and there is a nephew here today
Over twenty years
Were his father and mother going that day
His father and mother were both dead at that time
She followed him on board
The four dead bodies were buried before the mother went on board
No I did not see it but I knew both the husband and the wife
In  or
Mr Fleming and this was the year the late Mr Birnie came to be factor
Yes they were cropping it
We did receive payment as already stated
We would have been much better pleased if they had left the ground to ourselves
No
We dont complain of any of the present factors they did not do the harm
They simply exact from us what former ones exacted
Yes but I think it was against Mr Macdonalds wish that the late factor Mr Walker did make those parks in certain places
Mr Macdonalds intention was to reclaim land that had never before been cropped and not  to enclose land that was formerly cropped
From Benbecula to Barra Head
Some of them at the south end were given to crofters by doubling the crofts
But most of the lands were added to the tacks of Askernish and Milton
Frobost of which we have heard today already was cleared and added to a neighbouring tack and also Kildonan
Twentyseven families were evicted from Kildonan and also about twentyfour families from Bornish
Yes
There would be fully twelve in Lower Bornish
Yes the whole country there
None but those who would voluntarily go
Yes
I was born at Dalebroge
I remember from the time people were settled down thereat the time which the former delegate spoke of the removals for the tack of Chisholm and when the people were squatted here upon our lands
We have never experienced that we got any reduction of rents for those squatters
The lands upon which these people were squatted belonged to the township of Dalebroge
I am resident iu Garraheille but have beeu only seven years there
The complaint belongs to Dalebroge
The number which the former delegate gave
I cannot remember how many came but they were comiug from all quarters upon that land which belonged to Dalebroge
I was only a young boy at the time
We were paying   for the half of a croft
I never experienced that we got any reduction
I am not aware there was
No
Half a croft
A cow and a horse and a yearling horse and a calf and a stirk
One sheep
Small bits between lochs between peat banks
That is supposed to belong to us
It will not support any animal but we occasionally send them there
A few of them are satisfied with lots of land which have been recently increased
Yes  some of those in my township have recently acquired increased lots of land and they are satisfied
They were not able to stock them or pay rent for them
From the township
Two of them got pieces from the side of the tack off Askernish
Others had less than they had before and others had more than they had before
Some got it by the reducing of their neighbours lots
Yes
Ten families for a long time payiug rent
One or two recently settled down there
The two families whom I mention now are cottars and it is for those that the lands were taken off the neighbouring tack
I dont know the rent or the acreage
I cannot speak with certainty
One of the tenants of the large lots has just one cow one stirk a mare and a yearold horse
I think the other has four cows and three or four followers
Two horses and a yearold
I dont know anything about sheep but I know there are sheep
Perhaps they dont themselves know as the lots were only cut out last harvest
The factor was desirous to give according to their ability to take land
I was not accustomed to fish but I was accustomed to be a railway navvy or any other labour about quays and docks and I think I will require to take to that labour this year
Our land is so small that we cannot live upon it
If the land we had was sufficiently large as our parents had it and from which our parents took their food it would be then worth while to work upon it and we would also take our food upon it and we would not be necessitated to labour out of the country
Yes
My forefathers were accustomed to be supported in the country they were never obliged to go to earn money in the south but had plenty of sheep grain meal aud food of all kinds
At home even at this time of the year and after this time
My lot was made less this year
We dont know yet about these matters
Sufficient time has not elapsed to enable us to know whether our rents are reduced or not
I cannot tell
I believe that the rent will be less on account of the reduction
Yes before the potato failure
Yes it would yield as much crop
Yes with rare exceptions
I have no written statement I did not expect to speak here at all
No
All I have to say I can say in a few minutes
I find them very much improved from the time I came among them fourteen years ago
I find that the people whom I call my own especially are very much better off now than they were when I came among them
The most of them have far better houses
Some of them when I came among them had very miserable houses indeedhouses which I would not consider a good stable for my pony
But now it is very different
Some of them have got houses in which the proprietor might put up for a night
Their stock is better their clothing better and their feeding better
I have never yet heard any of our people coming to me and complaining of any grievances they had in regard to land or anything of that kind
With regard to other people of a different denomination I have experienced very great kindness among them since I got acquainted with them
I once had as many as sixty or seventy of their children in my school and some of these are now getting on very well and some have sent most favourable accounts from New Zealand
They were at one of the Edinburgh ladies schools
I still continue to experience very great kindness among the people
They live kindly and peaceably among each other and there were no strivings or rows uutil very lately
As to the cause of that I dont like to say much
Well I may not fix on the right thing and I am far safer not to say anything at all
Ycs
Not now
Since the public schools were opened I have not got any of them to my own school at all
Yes
They all read the Bible and learned the Shorter Catechism when at my school
I dont think it
Yes
I never insisted on it unless they were willing themselves
I will be thankful for the indulgence
It was not my intention to trouble the Commissioners with any statement until they had gone over all the estates with which I am officially connected but in consequence of statements made here today which to use a mild expression are of an exceedingly misleading character I thought that Barra was the proper place to take notice of these statements and that if I postponed my reply till the Commissioners reached Benbecula it would not have the same effect as if I stated it publicly in presence of the Barra people who know I wish to state the whole truth in a kindly way towards the people themselves
I wish to guard against making any reflections whatever upon the parties who have come forward today to give evidence but I must sayand I say it after taking a very great deal of trouble to make myself acquainted with the circumstances of the people of Barra and after taking considerable trouble to find out the most reliable people in Barra to give me information regarding the general population I must say that those who have appeared today are not the people on whom I would place the most reliance and I have to explain to the Commissioners that being desirous when they came to Barra to economise my time so far as practicable I thought of asking the crofters in the different townships to meet openly and name three individuals among themselves who would give me full information regarding their circumstances regarding anything which they thought it was possible or practicable to remedy and that I should have the opportunity of making some short explanations to the crofters from the different townships who met me
They did elect three persons in every township to give me information
I have a printed list of the names
I met them afterwards and took all the convenient opportunities I had to meet those who were freely set apart by the people themselves to give me full information regarding anything they thought possible to be donein the way of improving their condition
A printed statement of the names was sent out and circulated among the crofters geuerally in order that they might speak to these representatives or delegates whom they selected themselves and in order that any grievance they might have might be thoroughly investigated and if practicable and reasonable remedied
Now I expected when the Commissioners came round that some of those whom the crofters themselves selected in the open and unrestricted manner I have stated would have been among those who would have come forward to the Commissioners to give evidence
I wished to avoid the possibility of any one saying that I interfered in the remotest way with the evidence that was brought forward and I make no enquiry and did not know who was to appear today
I confess I was a little disappointedwithout reflecting in any way on those who came because I wish to guard particularly against saying anything derogatory to them but at the same time I must say really that they are not the representatives to give strangers an impression of the real state of matters in Barra
I say that in presence of Barra people and they know that I am stating the truth
With that explanation I shall as briefly as possible refer to a few matters reserving with the indulgence of the Commissioners any general statement I may wish to make until they have gone over the whole estates
I only wish on the present occasion to reply to certain statements which were made here today
Some of them I never heard of before and some of them surprised me more than they could have surprised the Commissioners because I should have naturally thought that if there had been certain grievances in Barra when I came and met the people and took special pains to investigate and inquire and make myself acquainted with those grievances they should have been intimated to me
Several matters have been brought before you as if they were a sort of general practice or custom on the estate of which I never heard the remotest whisper until I came into this room today
I shall refer to a few of these and in the first place I shall refer to Michael Buchanans statements
He asked in the way in which he and others have been tutored to ask whether anything would be done to him in consequence of his making certain statements but no one knows better than Michael Buchanan that though his main employment has been to go about and preach discontent among the people here no one connected with the estate would take the very slightest notice of his doings
He knew very well that whatever he did say to the Commissioners no notice would be taken of it
I am sure the proper way to deal with a person of that kind is to take no notice of him because in the long run statements which have no possible foundation in fact have no importance whatever and to take any notice of them would be to attach an importance to the individual which sometimes is scarcely deserved
His first statement was about taking stirks and cows from the tenants and giving no credit for them
It is well known and I say it in presence of the Barra people that such a custom does not exist on the estate
In  I find that in consequence of the destitute condition of the people of Barra Dr MLeod who was one of the most sympathising factors they ever had on the estate was obliged to take ponies and horses and cows and stirks from the tenants in payment of arrears of rent
I never did hear until today that the people had any reasonable ground to suspect that either Dr MLeod or any other local factor on the estate of Barra ever acted fraudulently or unjustly in connection with these matters
I shall not occupy the time of the Commissioners by referring to the cattle that Dr MLeod got from them because I intend to include that in my general statement but I just wish to say this that if any tenant on the estate of Barra thought there was a mistakebecause I dont think that any respectable people in Barra would think the gentleman who had charge of the estate could ever intentionally or fraudulently deal with the people here in the way whch has been insinuated by Michael BuchananI should have thought that coming here and being anxious to ascertain everything in the shape of grievance and anything that could possibly be remedied some of the crofters themselves whom I had the opportunity of meeting and some of the representatives whom they elected and with whom I had conversation on more occasions than one would have told me of these things
If they had done so I would have considered it my duty to make every possible investigation and if there was the slightest injustice done even unintentionally to any poor crofter in Barra no stone would have been left unturned to have that remedied
Then he said that the system was carried on down to the present time
I dont wish to use strong language but I must say that that is not the fact With reference to receipts he made a statement which would naturally convey the  impression to strangers and persons who did not know the circumstances that people were treated in such a way that they did not know how their account stood that in fact the system was organised in such a way as to defraud the crofters
Now I have found in Barra and in South Uist and in Benbecula that now and then mistakes did occur in connection with payments made in cash by the crofters but in most cases these mistakes did occur in consequence of the similarity of names
It will be fouud that in certain townships there were certain crofters of the same name
It was only the other day that a man came and said he had made a payment and it was not put to his credit
I turned up the counterfoilbecause I may state that for many years the payment of rent has been conducted in this way that not one penny is received from a crofter without granting a receipt for the payment and the counterfoils of the receipts are preserved in the same way as those in a cheque book
The receipts are partly printed and are numbered consecutively so that from the counterfoils of the receipts it can be seen at any time whether any mistakes have taken place with regard to a sum being placed perhaps to the credit of John MKinnon in one township instead of John MKinnon in another township
Perhaps it may happen that there is a senior and a junior of the same name or perhaps there is a Jonathan MKinnon or perhaps they speak of the same person as Hugh MLean or Ewan MLean
It so happens that I have here all the counterfoils of the receipts so that if any crofter should come forward and say that he has made a payment at such and such a time and he does not find it to be his credit it can be seen from the counterfoils whether a receipt has been granted for it and it is not possible that the factor could receive the money without granting a receipt and the crofters know that the receipts they get are upon these forms and they are generally of the same colour
I dont think it is neces ary for me to take up more of your time with regard to these matters
Buchanan also referred to the alleged injustice done to the people by prohibiting them taking shellfish
Well I never heard of such a thing till I came into this room and certainly if I had heard of such a thing I should have been the first to say that the people should disregard out and out any such reports
He mentioned that if any one said a just word in favour of another crofter the officials were down upon him
Now I simply refer to himself as a man who is well known for several years as having no regular occupation but going about in a mysterious sort of way with pen and paper in his pocket to several houses and if anybody had been taken notice of Michael Buchanan would have been the man but he has been taken notice of and he is perfectly free to do anything he likes so long as he lives
No notice will be taken of his doings and as to his statement that if any one said a just word for another the officials would be down upon him I can only refer to himself as a striking instance of the want of foundation for such a statement He said again that where matters were laid before her Ladyship the factor stepped in and offered every possible objection
He said nothing in support of that allegation and he could say nothing in support of that allegation
I dont wish to take any credit to myself for the interest I take in the people of Barra
I think the Commissioners have not at all seen a fair representation of the honesty in point of character of the general body of the inhabitants of Barra
They are people of whom I have a very high opinion indeed and if I had never seen anything of them except what I have seen today I should never have formed such a high opinion of the fishermen and crofters of Barra as I have done
I do not wish to take any special credit to myself for the natural pleasure I would have in seeing anything organised that would be the means of improving the condition of a people whom I like very much and I certainly should be the last to step in and offer any possible opposition to any communication that might be made with the view of interesting Lady Gordon Cathcart in their behalf
I say that the statement is a reckless statement without a shadow of foundation that can possibly be given in support of it
You have heard already about the cockles and shellfish and I need not say anything more about them except that if anybody raised any report about people not being allowed to take them it must have been a mischievous report
The report may have been raised by somebody who really wished to make the people believe that those who were interested in them were acting in a way towards them which was irritating and unjust
I dont think that any one even the meanest officials connected with the estate would have been a party to the circulation of such a mischievous report if such a report was ever circulated in Barra
He said there were no fences between the tenants and the tacksmen
One of the last things I did when I was here about two years ago was to have a meeting with one of Dr MGillivrays sons and the tenants bordering upon a portion of his farm and make an arrangement for the repair of this fence
There is no doubt it is very difficult to get the crofters to keep up their share of the fences
One man goes and does a little bit and his neighbour goes and perhaps does it more imperfectly and it is well known that such a fence is of very little valueit is like a chain with a broken linkit is really of no use uuless it is a proper fence from end to end
There is a difficulty in getting these fences kept in repair and they are certainly not such fences as I should like to see but they are fences which the Commissioners may see for themselves if they choose to take a walk for a mile or two
I dont think I should take up much time in making reference to general statements because the Commissioners cannot fail to see how very contradictory these general statements were
Some came forward and Michael Buchanan was one of them who said that the inhabitants were reduced to poverty
He stated that in the strongest terms and then there were others who came forward and said that the tenants of one of the townships are able to take a grazing requiring a capital of between  and  to stock it so that these general statements neutralise one another and it is not necessary for me to say very much beyond what I do now
I dont know what may be the amount of debts due to the merchants but judging from all the information I have been able to get and I have endeavoured to get the most reliable information available my conviction is that the general body of the crofters are probably better off than they ever have been
It is well known and it is a thing not common to Barra only but to every other place that you find old people speaking of the good old times  but if those good old times are looked into and if there is any accurate history of the state of things at the period to which these old people refer it is generally foundI dont mean to say that they deliberately and intentionally misrepresent the state of things in their daythat they exaggerate the advantageous condition in which they suppose themselves to have been when they were young
I shall state with reference to Barra that knowing as I do the condition not only of crofters and small farmers but of large farmers and fishermen on the east coast of Scotland I dont know any place in Barra so highly rented as the east coast if we compare the value of their stock and their crop and the effects belonging to them with their rent
It is well known on the mainland that if a farmer has a capital ten times the amount of rent he pays he is considered to be in very fair circumstances but if we come to the estate of Barra we find that the circumstances are much more favourable than that
I have before me a very carefully prepared statement of the number of cows stirks calves horses colts sheep and lambs belonging to crofters and also to cottars in Barra and I made a sort of calculation which I consider a very moderate calculation of the value of the stock
I find that there are  cows in Barra belonging to crofters which at  each would amount to   sixquarterold stirks which I value at    stirks at   Tims the crofters have cattle stock on their crofts estimated at that moderate valuation to be worth  They have  horses which I take on an average at   colts  at  in all  They have  sheep and  young sheep
As I wish to make a moderate estimate I take the
About  The cottars have  cows  sixquarterolds  animals between calves and stirks  horses  colts  old sheep and  young sheep
I value these at less than the crofters animals and I take  as the value of the stock belonging to the cottars who pay no rent to the proprietor
These sums amount altogether to  Mr Phillips who is now in charge of this parish has gone over every croft in Barra and inspected the extent of ground under potatoes bere black oats white oats and turnips and I have an abstract of his report before me which was very carefully prepared and I find that the value of the crops is  s
The total value of crops and stock is  s
Of course the crofters have besides the roofs of the houses belonging to them which would increase the value of the capital that may be said to belong to them
Now the annual rent paid by the crofters at the time of this annual valuation was  s and if the rent is compared with the value of the stock and the crops which they have upon their croftsto what extent it may be burdened by debts to the merchant I dont know the stock is  or  per cent more than can be got on the most prosperous places on the mainland with which I am acquainted
 s id
There are a few of the tenants who are not much in arrear but there are others who are very deeply in arrear
Calculating the whole and comparing the gross amount of arrears and the gross amount of rent there are upwards of five years rent in arrears and some of them are upwards of ten for instance at Mingalay where if there is Home Rule at all the inhabitants of that island enjoy it
The only other point I wish  to refer to is the complaint made about the increase of rent and the land being taken from them
I happen to have before me the rental of the estate of Barra from Whitsunday  to Whitsunday  I believe it is the rental on which the estate was purchased
Yes
Almost the whole of it was crofters rental because it happened that General Macneill had most of the other places in his own occupation
The largest rent is  and there are some at  and a good many at  I have no rental here higher than 
No
Just about the same
I have here an abstract of the rental and valuation of the estate of Barra in  The rental of possessions now let as returned by the factor was  s d  add twelve and a half vacant crofts not occupied formerly let at   s  d   value of farms in Colonel Macneills possession offers for which were under considerationhome farm capable of grazing  sheep  Vatersay  sheep hill of Bentangaval  sheep island of Sandray  sheep  island of Flodda  sheep small islands  sheep  number of sheep that the land in Colonel Macneills possession was supposed to carry   which at s d per head would give  Therefore the amount of the land rent of Barra at that time was  s d
There was addedkelp on the shores   alkali works which were carried on with a view of extracting valuable materials from the kelpno sum placed opposite to this  mansionhouse fishings and other things gross estimated rental   but there is   struck off as fanciful
The preseut rent is    and the crofters rents have been very greatly reduced
From the last valuation return in  the total is  l i s  d but deducting schools churches and glebe which were not included in the valuation  it leaves  l i s  d as against  s d
So far as I know
I wish to take the opportunity of stating that I never until today heard of any alteration of boundaries sixteen years ago
I took the opportunity of consulting Mr Phillips who has been over all the crofts and he never heard of anything of the kind
I suppose so I suppose they were not able to pay the rent
They were deeply in arrear and in fact are deeply in arrear still
I shall be very glad to make every investigation into the matter
I may state that certain places which were under crofters in Fuday and Hellisayare now occupied by Dr MGillivray
Then Ollosdale was occupied by eighteen crofters for which they paid  s and it was let as a single farm until this year when I thought it would be an advantage to try the system of increasing the crofts so that there would be sufficient employment for a family all the year round on the crofts and with Lady Cathcarts consent Ollosdale was divided and instead of having it at  we proposed to have it at  or   less thau it was in
And some of these places being let to Dr MGillivray
I think that about  or  would be for land formerly in the hands of crofters and now let to Dr MGillivray and for Ollosdale
Yes I have no doubt of that because we have to deal with certain places where there can be no difference on the area which did not lie contiguous to large farms
I shall give one or two instances to complete my statement
Glen which is the place where we are now the modern name of it being Castle Bay was occupied in  by twentyfive crofters paying from   to  and the total reut was  s
The present rent of Glen is  s
So far as I know
Then on Cregston in  there were fifteen tenants paying  s d and now the rent of Cregston including the priests croft and the doctors is 
Yes
There are seventeen crofters now in Cregston as against fifteen in
I should not like to say so but it is very difficult to account for the great reduction which it was absolutely necessary to make
I cannot state precisely but I shall make it up
I find that Bentangaval was in possession of General MNeill in  and also the adjoining grazing of Vatersay
There was a statement made to day about the people being refused the island of Vatersay
Well the people here petitioned for the island of Vatersay and of course it is very difficult to know even with the additional information I got since they made the application whether they were really able to make good their application or not
I may say that the matter was very anxiously and carefully considered by Lady Cathcart and that if she had believed it would have been a benefit to the crofters to get the island of Vatersay she would have given it to them but this being an island the experience of other islands where people are located led us to think that it was most unsuitable for them
For instance the island of Mingalay which was said to be a pretty good island is found to be most unsuited for the people if we judge by their circumstances aud the amount of their arrears which is not a bad indication of the condition of the tenants
They are upwards of ten years rent in arrears and in consequeuce of the difficulty of getting to the island they have enjoyed for some considerable period a certain amount of Home Rule and the result in Mingalay has certainly been most prejudicial
The man who was a sort of constable there met me when I was last in Barra and told me of the state of the people and I was really sorry that they should be left in such an island but in consequence of their attachment to the locality and the difficulty of even recommending crofters to leave one place and go to another they must just be left there
Latterly however they found the place so unsuitable for them that I had several applications from Mingalay people to come over to prosecute the fishing here
I told them that those who were good fishermen would certainly get a share of what was proposed to be a sort of club farm for Castle Bay where the amount of ground they would get would not so easily iuterfere with what I considered to be absolutely necessary for successful fishingthat is that it should be prosecuted not by fits and starts but as a business the same as any other business is prosecuted
I dont know any business that is prosecuted not now and then but thoroughly all the year round that does not prosper and I dont believe it is possible for fishermen either in Barra or in any other place to be as prosperous and successful as they might be and as they ought to be unless they disencumber themselves of what really interferes with the continuous prosecution of the fishing
On the east coast with which I am most intimately acquaintedhaving to do I suppose with the largest fishing village in Scotland namely Buckie where there are between  and  fishermentill within the last twentyfive or thirty years the fishermen had what were called fisher lots
They had three acres aud were a sort of crofters aud grew potatoes  but since they commenced to devote their attention to the fishing everyone of these lots which were known and marked on the estate plan as fisher lots is occupied by cottars or feuars or merchants
Not a single individual fisherman among all these hundreds would take the trouble of working a lot because they found that it seriously interfered with the prosecution of the fishing and probably very often when it was absolutely necessary that they should either be prosecuting the fishing or making active preparations for fishing at home or at a distance they would require to be at home tilling their ground or taking in their crops
I know how difficult it is to overcome local prejudices and I know how difficult it is to interfere in a violent way with these prejudices even when they have no foundation whatever and I should consider it injudicious to deprive the fishermen here of a small piece of ground but I dont despair of seeing the time when the fishermen on this coast will exactly take the course which by experience the fishermen on the east coast have found to be best for the promotion of their interest
I was going to say that instead of giving off crofts to those fishermen Lady Cathcart thought it was probably better that they should get as much land as would be potato ground and enable them to provide provender to keep a cow to supply the children with milk
Accordingly after considering the matter carefully I made out a memorandum and submitted it to the fishermen offering fortyfive fishermen a portion of the grazing of Vatersay which lies contiguous to the anchorage here because it was believed that if they had land it should be in close proximity to the sea  and I find as I have often to grant building sites on the east coast that they must have the houses as near the sea as possible because they may have to go out early in the morning whereas if they were to get crofts and have detached houses not only would the cultivation of these crofts interfere with the prosecution of the fishing but having the houses dotted over the place it would be practically impossible for them to adopt the only mode of fishing which is found to be successful where people have had longer experience than they have had upon the west coast
Not of Vatersay but of what was formerly the grazing of Vatersay
We have offered them the whole of the portion of the grazing of Vatersay which is on the mainland and close to the port
We have offered it at a less rent than the agents of General Macneill valued it at in  and at the same rent we could have let it to a tenant who would have given no trouble but paid his rent across the table
The place is supposed to carry seven hundred sheep and forty cattle in a good season
I wanted them to take only seven sheep each and a cow and I proposed that they should select a committee of five so that they might manage the sheep in a way that would bring them some return
I was particularly anxious that in giving them this piece of ground arrangements should be made so that the sheep stock might be managed in a way which would be profitable to themselves and would open the eyes of the other crofters on the other parts of the estate so that they might be induced to adopt a somewhat similar mode of managing their stock
Latterly Mr Phillips wrote to me that they were not able or not willing to buy the seven sheep which is little more than onethird of the sheep stock on the grazing ground
The grazing ground offered to them was about  acres
I shall do so on Monday or Tuesday
I beg also to hand in the list of the committee appointed by the tenants to give information as to any grievance requiring remedy if it was possible to do so
Yes
Yes
I think Mr Ross has gone over the ground pretty well
Nowadays everything is done with expedition and we miss the telegraph so much here that we often miss the market on the Continent
On the east coast if we do not sell to local agents we sell by telegraph to foreign agents and generally it is done by telegraph
I have no doubt that if we had the telegraph here we could do the same
We are placed at a great disadvantage
We are placed so that we may perhaps miss the market or have to sell our herring at a price below what we might get if we had command of the foreign market by telegraph
The foreign market
We do very little indeed in the home market
Looking to the capital employed there is no other industry in Great Britain so far as I know that has not the facilities of telegraphic communication in this nineteenth century and I think we are far behind the age
The capital employed by the fishermen alone amounts to  The fish curers capital will amount to  and the estimated income to the countrythat is the money realised for our produceis  or  That I consider is a great industry and a benefit to the country in general and I think we should have facilities for conducting our  business in a proper way as we have on the east coast
Yes principally the German and the Russian market
There is a prohibitory tariff in France
A few east coast herring go to Odessa but the carriage is heavy
None
Germany is our principal market for the east coast fishing and Russia takes a good deal of our west coast herring
It is not very high only about s
Well I believe that during the winter it is a very exposed coast and there are a number of days and weeks and perhaps months when they could not prosecute the sea fishing as we do on the east coast
Another thing is that I dont think the fishing is so important
The haddock fishing is the east coast fishing and the winter herring fishing
Of course it has never been tried and there is room for improvement here
I think so in Barra
I have been more or less connected with it since
Equally well
They bought them from the east coast people perhaps two or three years old
Very few I suppose half a dozen days would cover it
We had two days only this week
Tuesday was the best fishing ever seen in Castle Bay and last night was very bad
Comparatively
I am sure it would
I believe they would
I think Lady Cathcart and Mr MNeill merchant here
Yes at the white line fishing but not at the herring fishing
By a larger class of boats than they use in the winter time
They have only been using the smaller class of boats
The fishing might also be improved by the use of better gear and better lines and by the men becoming more skilful and more persevering
In that way I believe they would come to develop the fishing in this part of the world
I believe the curers would be inclined to give a small item but I maintain that the importance of our industry demands it
Yes
About twenty miles
I cannot say
I think the Government should not make it a matter of expense at all
It is a great source of wealth to the country and other parts of the country are benefited by us being here
I believe we would take more money out of the business and hence we would give the more for our article
I believe we would
The more we get the more we spendthat is generally the result
The more we get on the east coast the more we give to our fishermen and the more all hands are paid
I cure over  barrels on the east coast and I could not manage the business without telegraph and telephone
No but by residents in Barra as welL
Yes
I think so
I have been curing on my own account for the last twentythree years
Since
that they should have grazing ground to keep a couple of cows and a score of sheep or so with the fishing combined
No the cultivation is nothing here  it is the grazing
I dont know but the Russians seem to like a herring that is oilier and fatter in its nature
They take the salt but we dont cure them so salt
Yes if you keep them away from the sun
They will not stand the sun along with our east coast herrings
Yes
Yes
In Germany it is the poorest class in the country who eat the east coast herring and in Russia it is the richest class who eat the west coast herring
Yes
That is nonsense
You can cure them quite well if you keep them away from the sun
Yes
Yes but if you cure them too salt people will not buy them
No there is a certain degree of salt that you must use for the east coast and if we used the same amount of salt for the west coast herring we would make them uneatable
They will take the same quantity of salt but it will make them not of the same value
Yes
Yes double
Yes
Yes
No not in my experience
In   crans was the average
I cannot say I think they were in North Bay Castle Bay and Vatersay
Yes and the average was  crans
That year it was not so high
It was the year of the FrancoGerman war and the blockade was put on and our herrings were excluded
We had to rush them into the Russian market or get them in by way of Denmark
We lost a pound per barrel in that way
Yes we get encouragement to take double that quantity
Well I dont know that
 at  percent is good value
I think they are well able to pay that supposing they only fished six months
On the east coast they belong to the fishermen alone
No
Yes
Generally two on the east coast and they hire the others
Well all our east coast men do that
Generally when they are building a new boat they get assistance
I have given them  to assist them
Yes very much especially during the last five years
Both tonnage and construction
The change is to a boat of a longer keel with a greater draught of water and greater seagoing ability
The model of the boat has also changed within the last five years from the round scarfed boat to the type known by the name of the Zulu
No  it is about fifteen yearssince the first deck was used
A very great safety
Well it is in every respect better and I dont see any disadvantage
Some people say there is greater danger of life being lost but take the number of hands employed in that industry and see the number of boats lost every year
Of course when a boat founders in rough weather that is a different thing but there are only two or three lost in a season out of the thousands employed
There is no other industry in which there are fewer accidents
Take quarrying for instance  there is scarcely a newspaper but contains accidents to quarriers
I consider the deck a great improvement and I have nothing to say against it
There have been changes on the sails within the last two years
I think it is
Well I dont know unless you come to steam
There are two or three on the east coast
I think there were two at Aberdeen belonging to Leith and one belonging to Wick but they belong to capitalists and not to fishermen
It requires too much money for a fisherman to invest in these
About the same time about the st of May
I should think that was a very fanciful reason
But fish are very erratic creatures they change their localities
They are considered superior
You cannot compare loch herring with sea herring
I believe the Loch Fyne herring are the finest for the table
They are fleshier and more plump
The Loch Fyne herring would not cure for the Continent
Yes
The tenants who are paying rent are complaining that there are too many cottars disturbing them with the small holdings they havethat they are a burden to them
Some of them by fishing and at other times by bits of land which they get for work to plant potatoes
Not to any bodyno rent whatever
I cannot really tell how long but they never had any landsthese twentyfour cottars
The cottars bade me to say here that they never had any lands and that they wanted lands if they could get them and that there was a kind of promise to them this year that they would get them
They stay on the land that the tenants have got
Yes but they go and labour on big farms
No
No we never give them anything for the houses
A few of them have cows
They buy what will keep them up and some of them have patches of land on MLellans farm
They do not get it from the tacksmen
They did not use to get it from the tacksman at all but from the tenant
In money
 or thereabouts
They buy it from those who have not a cow
s or thereabouts but the most of them had a little fodder of their own in addition
They paid s or thereabouts for fodder for the winter
It is the tenant who gets it
About two shillings
I never work but they tell me they get that
I am a dealer in a small way and sometimes I act as agent for curers in engaging women for them here and so on
Very few  whenever there are not enough to supply them they take a few from the east coast
Sometimes according to the number of boats that come
They are very ready to accept it
They get  of arles money in the winter time
There are three women for every boat the curer has
For every barrel they fill and pack they get eightpence and when there is no packing or gutting they get three pence an hour for any other work the curer wants them to take
According to the work
About   in the season forbye the arles
Yes
The fishing lasts six or seven weeks but some seasons they do not make  They did not make  last year
Yes
About nineteen or twenty
Yes
Yes and the cottars too
They were raised there
The children of both crofters and cottars
Yes
My mother and sister were the last that had it
No they are all dead
Mr MNeill has it now
I was too young at the time and my mother was put out
She could pay it and more than that
She was put out on account of not being pleased with them for taking the sheep from her at the time of the great wrong that was done by Colonel Macneill
Yes
Yes
She had more sheep than any crofter that was in Barra and there were plenty at that time
There were no big farmers in the islaud at all and the hills were full of sheep belonging to the crofters and my mother had more than any of fiem
She had about one hundred sheep on the hill and all these sheep were taken away over to Vatersay by Colonel Macneills orders
I saw the constable and foreman take them away and owing to my mother objecting to that the croft was taken from her
She had two cows and a mare and a foaL and a colt and a few other beasts
A while after that and after the croft was taken from her there was a call put out again that there was to be an account given to the colonel and the constables came round and every one gave them a cow
Let him be tenant or cottar the cow was taken from every one in Barra after the sheep were taken away
The cow itself from every one in Barra was to be taken away
So many constables came for the cows and took them away but my mother objected to giving a cow
She had two of them and they were on another mans grass on tethers and the constables went and took one and the tether along with it
There was a sister of mine in the family at the time and I was quite young at the time and we met them with the cow coming up the road
My sister ran at one of the constables and hurt him on the knee and took the cow  from him
We could run better than they and the cow ran well and ran back to the house  she knew the houseand in she went and my mother took a stone and put it at the back of the door to keep it fast
The constables came to the door and tried to break it open to get the cow
I got above the lintel of the door with a stick in my hand and knocked off the hat of oue of them with the stick
They went away and told this to the factorthe colonel was not at homeand told what we had done to the constable and how the man was harried and all by trying to take the cow away from us
The factor gave them an order to take all she had from her thento come and take every cow and horse that belonged to her
That factors name was Macrae Askernish
I was about twelve years old at the time
There was no settlement required to be taken or given
I do not think they were
It did not look like that
They would take whatever they liked at any time
There was never any settlement for years at all
Those who are at the herring fishing want me to tell that they are charged net ground by the proprietor
No they are the Barra people
They complain they are charged s d for net groundfor the nets they land on their own ground
That is what they tell me
I believe it
Have any of them a receipt for that
It is the curer who charges them for it
Yes by the people of Tangasdale
Yes
I have to say that they lost their land the onethird of the township and other land was promised to them for it but they did not get it
Yes the onethird of their land was taken from them and they were told they would get other land for it but that promise was not redeemed
Sixteen years ago
After the rent was paid I was put out at the end of a month
They have lost their means
The land is dear
On the crofters lands
By days wages from any person from whom I can get it
I get work from Mr MNeill merchant here
I never went to seek employment from the large tacksmen
s and sometimes s d a day
Curing fish
Generally half the year
The rest of the year I work about his own house
No the day is short then
s d
I was not at that kind of work when I was a young man
I had land of my own then
The highest was s d s and so on
Meal was dearer then than it is now but there was no meal imported at that time
We did not need it
Plenty grew upon the land
When the men had planted the land there was as much growing to them as would support them in meal
Money is scarcer with them
They make more money but they give it away for meal and for other means of livelihood
My wife
It grew with the tacksman here
The tacksman that left Vatersay got itMr Archibald MLellan
To add it on to the tack
No abatement of rent
We were promised additional land in exchange for it which we did not get but the rent remains upon the township still the same as it was before
In my opinion there were at least  acres perhaps up to
No not a penny
Yes
No
We would not get it any wayeven supposing we asked it  but I was broken down and did not like to make much of a row about it
Certainly
There is a mill yet at the other end of the island
No there is not so much meal ground as would keep the mill going one day in the week
All the meal is imported
Oh plenty of it I may say he has the half of Barra and he cultivated a good deal of it
It does not get the onesixth it could grind
The meal comes from Glasgow
Yes they are
The land is so small and it is getting inferior by continuous cropping
The people are getting poorer
Thirteen years
Yes I had my share of the third portion that the township lost
No the croft was taken from me to be given to a policeman whom they brought into the place
It was not because of poverty that I was deprived of it but through injustice
I brought home  some money after paying the rent I had no arrears
No it was taken from me in order to be given to the policeman
The policeman selected mine rather than that of any one else in the township and of course he must needs get it
Probably that was the case
At any rate he fixed his eye upon mine
Mr Birnie
The very reason because it was the best
Nothing was given to me
The rent was paid and there was nothing due by me
I left the houses with them they were of no use to me
Not by any means
I am happy enough though I am not so well off but I shall soon be past work
Yes
Yes three daughters and a little boy
Yes
Yes
One of them goes to the east coast fishing and they assist her too when the fishing is going on
There is another who goes out to service here in this place
Yes
Another had it and it was vacant when I entered
Yes I pay s d and road money and poor money altogether coming to s d
Yes I paid him   
It is a small house
No not the breadth of my bonnet
Yes
I get bits of land from other people out of which I grow fodder to feed my cow
Yes on the hill
 generally
I pay it in work I work to them
Nine years
I was paying it until last year and this year
I have not paid it for the last two years
To the proprietor
It is upon the house  they never charged us for peats
To different people
I pay it to the one from whom I can get the grass
Are you a fisherman
I am not a fisherman just now
Yes
The great majority of the people of the place and afterwards two came with me to the schoolhouse here
Yes
They complain that they are kept down for the last sixty years with high rents their little holding is made smaller and deteriorating from having been long cropped so that they are not now worth cultivating
They cannot support themselves but by their earnings elsewhere only they lose their time by working after it and about it and although they are still constantly engaged with it they are not able to make a livelihood out of it for themselves and their families
They are in that condition for the last sixty years
There are today twentysix families where there were only twelve fifty years ago
They are very badly off
They have been very much held down during that time and the first improvement was since the present proprietrix Lady Gordon Cathcart came into possession
It was difficult for her to do very much to improve their condition it is so lately since she came into possession and she found them so very poor
It was difficult for her to remedy the great poverty that prevailed
They were of opinion that if her feeling towards them could find expression she wished to improve their condition but they have not yet been able to find much of the benefit of her good wishesonly the time is short
They were much held down in every way
Every one that was anything like well off in the place was holding down the others
At first we had a great deal of land in the place and they crowded those in these places upon the other poor people
Some of us whose names were in the rentroll of the proprietor were deprived of some of our lands to be given to these people
Others who had no bit of land at all were still a burden to us
We were keeping all these people and we were on the rentroll of the proprietor and we have got no abatement of rent although we had to maintain these people
If they had any stocka horse or cow or sheepwe had to graze them  and they cleared the ground for the large tacksmen altogether and they took the people that were upon them and put them upon us
So the piece of land that our fathers and grandfathers had three or four families are upon the piece today
At one time they were preventing us walking here to the place where we could put our fish upon the rocks
Very stormy winters prevailed and our chief means of support the potato has been precarious ever since the potato disease
Some years it would not grow well
During winters such as these perhaps the people of the place would have no means of support except shellfish
They wished to deprive us of the shellfish and the poor people would go four miles away at ebb tide to gather shellfish having no other means of support in their households except what they would bring home of shellfish for that day
When the tide was low perhaps they would gather more than they would be able to put beyond the tidal mark
They were in the habit of preventing us from laying it down upon tufts of grass within reach of the tide and they set up a notice to be posted on the doors of the church preventing us going at all
The clergyman we had here at that time told the postman that he would put up that notice upon the door of the church he would deprive him of his situationso anxious was he that the people would not be deprived of that privilege
Since the poor people were aware that the priest was an educated man they were encouraged and they continued gathering the shellfish
Everything of that sort they wished to deprive us of
Those who managed the property for the proprietors until the present proprietrix came into possession would not allow the young people to marry upon the estate or to build houses
If I allowed my son or my daughter to remain even in the stable they would deprive me of my holding or threaten to deprive me of my holding
But Lady Gordon Cathcart has done away with that state of matters
They have left us so poor that when the children of the poor man grew up not one of them could remain assisting the father
They would require to earn wages through the world
Perhaps the son would go away before he was of age to earn wages and never return
They sent away most of our relatives to America thirtyfive years ago
They pulled down the houses over their heads and injured them in every possible way
They valued the brutes higher than the men whom God created in his own image and were more gentle with them and all the respect that we have received during the last fifty years has been received from the present proprietrix
But it was difficult for her to improve our condition
We must speak the truth to all men
The present proprietrix has not made ushas left us as we wereall the advantage we had received
We have nothing to say
I cannot say that they have made us anything worse than we were when she came into possession
I hope that any proprietor might do something for us
I think any proprietor might put us in the position in which our fathers and grandfathers were
To give them the land at the same rent at which their grandfathers had it  and they are now so poor that even supposing I should get the holding at the same rent at which my grandfather had it it would be difficult for me to stock it for poverty has pressed upon us so sorely and so long
I think if we got assistance in some way we would endeavour to repay it in a number of years
There are some that could take up a little more than they have
If these acres were the kind of land that would yield good crops perhaps the rent might do but in the case of auy one of my neighbours in the township in which I am the place is rockyit is only rocks and it should not be cultivated at all
For the place I occupy myself during the last fifty years I do not remember it without a crop and the only variation was potatoes and barley
It is about five acres socalled half of it rocks
We will be endeavouring to do it but it is hard to say what would
I could not possibly go six yards without coming upon a rock
Duriug the last three years I was not able to take more than two returns out of it
Two horses
 s
Yes
No I was only a poor working man
I was at times fishing but I have given it up now
I had to buy for the last two years every morsel of meal that supported ten of a family
I am bringing home during this year two bolls of meal every month
Oatmeal s a boll flour s d and s
Very little milk
I had not for the last twelve months as much milk as would allow for one meal a day to the family
Our cattle are so poor for want of grass that they could not provide milk
They could not feed the calves
They also give very ill usage to our cattle in another way here
If they grazed upon the lands of the large farmers they would pound them and then the cows would be illused
They would lose their calves and the mares would lose their foals
The shepherds would put them in in the morning and they had not the civility to send us word although I and my son would be searching for the animal the whole day they had not the civility to send us any word about it and gave us no warning and perhaps when I reached the door they would be in the other end of the place and I would have to go home
Yes
Yes certainly if we got any land suitable
I know well it is the worst portion of the land that we have got
Both oats and barley a little oats
I scarcely get any return at all
I use the best of it as fodder for my cattle
I only got as much as resowed the crop
Two returns
For the last two years six returns
Last year about five
Yes about seven
The best year would be eight or nine
About two bushels
About other two
About eight barrels of potatoes but it is not my own ground I plant them on
If I planted eight barrels of potatoes on my own ground I could only sow one bushel of barley and one bushel of oats
About three barrels
Yes the year they yield an average crop
The eldest I have fit for work is a girl of twenty and the next to her is fifteen
I earn it
I have been in the south country continuously for the last thirty years earning wages to support my family
As a labourer getting any work that I could get
I was many years at the east coast fishing
Yes I used to serve as one of the crew upon an east coast boat
I was poorly and was getting weak for the work
The young men serve in the crews of the east coast boats here
Yes about seven or eight which they got a year or two ago
Yes they are doing as others do sometimes better sometimes worse
Yes at some times
The fishing would suit remarkably well here if they were in the same condition in which my father aud grandfather were
The place is very much exposeda wild coastand there are many times of the year when they cannot fish
They could fish when the weather was suitable for fishing and if they had land they could work upon it when it was wild weather but to be fishermen solely without anything to support them during the wild seasons causes them loss
They will require to risk the boats and the tackle in wild weather when they have nothing to support the family at home
Perhaps after one has bought fresh tackle it may be destroyed by the rough shores before he is able to earn as much money as pays for the tackle alone
Yes if you only fish iu good weather
The shore that the east coast fishermen have is different from this
Their shore is a channel it is not so rough as this
I think that if I tried the fishing here during the wild weather I might lose both interest and profit
They can only work the big boats here with expensive tackle and the big boats are here only at the fishing season at this time
She has not made it better as yet
Some of us have not got the benefit of her good wishes as yet but she has given liberty to some
Before this time when young people married they were preveuted from building houses
She has given them orders and permission to build houses
She made a pier and I believe that those who got big boats received assistance from her in order to get the boats
I do not know there are others who can tell about that
My brother is a crofter
Yes I have laboured for the last twentyeight years to pay the rent with him
Freely and unanimously
There were six or seven from the township of Borv having the consent of all the rest
Yes
I only wish to have first the opportunity of saying a few words
I should like to get an assurance that my interest and that of my brother whose name is written in the rental should not be hurt by any procedure taken by the landlord or factorI mean in the way of evictionfor any truthful statement I may make here to day before the Royal Commission
The people are complaining of the smallness of their holding and its inferior quality of the uphandedness of the factors and the oppression of landlords
Before the year  the island of Barra was almost always occupied by crofters who lived comfortably and contentedly iu possession of reasonably large crofts the population being then about  and at present it is only
The whole estate of Barra
The first took place fortyyears ago and the second took place thirtyseven years ago
Down from these dates incoming factors and incoming ground officers were participating in the same action
Down to the present time
People in those days particularly in such an outlandish place as this is did not  understand very much the use of receipts
They used to pay their rents and when the receipt was handed over perhaps some of them carried it home and perhaps some of them did not
However those who did carry it home perhaps lost it or mislaid it
The next time they made their appearance before the factor to pay their rent they were told You did not pay your rent last year
 I did
You did not where is your  receipt
I have seen some of them going home a matter of six or seven miles and coming back breathless with the receipt
Some would happen to find it at home and some would not
No
About twentytwo years ago
The large farmers in this island in the event of an incoming factor would of course get first in contact with him and I understand that we the poor people would get a very bad character and we would be most likely during that mans time under the suspicion that we were bad characters
Any grievances that we stated to the factor he would postpone or resist
He would say  I will see you tomorrow and then when I saw him tomorrow he would say  Oh I cant do anything for you
On the other hand if any of those large farmers were to express any grievance they would be sure that the factor would listen to them
It was in former times and is still kept up in a less degree
That their cattle were forcibly taken away from them and in many cases after selling those cattle some  of the men did not get any credit for the proceeds
I refer to the cattle taken away in those days
They were taken away by the ground agents and factors
For a nominal price and in the name of rent and in many cases afterwards the people never got credit for the money proceeds
The inhabitants of the island being reduced to such poverty the consequence was that they were not able to pay rent and could scarcely ask for land
Consequently the best and the most of the land fell into the hands of large farmers and the poor men were huddled together the one lessening the holding of the other and that was on the most worthless and useless patches of land that could be found within the marches of the parish of Barra
Labouring under such disadvantages they were obliged to apply to Dr MGillivray for some ground for which they paid sixty days labour per acre of sandy inferior and exhausted soil
About six years ago there were letters down from the English market desiring the natives of this island to gather every kind of shellfish particularly cockles which were and are very abundant and to be found on the strand lying adjacent to Dr MGillivrays farm
Dr MGillivray tried to prevent any collection of this shellfish
The people did not pay much attention to what he said
Then his brotherinlaw being at the time the head ground officer on the estateor at least he was called sodrew up a paper with orders that it should be posted up on the chapel door threatening the gatherers of this shellfish with certain penalties
The officiating clergyman of that chapel did not give his assent to this proceeding and told his congregation that he considered it an illegal act
Being thus baffled those two gentlemen as justices of the peace ordered policemen to watch for fear that any of the shellfish should be laid down above high watermark
For the stormy seas by which this island is surrounded for the irregularity of the ground and banks by which it is surrounded because the nourishing ingredients natural where fish live are not to be found about this island and because they can only fish opposite here at certain seasons of the year and if the weather does not permit at these certain seasons of the year the fisherman loses the privilege
I admit that the fishing industry is a great help combined with that of land
The reason is that when I dont get to sea if I have less or more land I have still something to support me but supposing I have no land if I am going to sea and getting no fish I have nothing at all whereby my family can live
The second reason is the insular situation of this island and its irregular postal communication from which we learn the state of the markets
Though local merchants here would buy fish they must always be very cautions they must always depend upon the contingency of future markets
In regard to a fishermans land I should say he should have about seven acres to keep a cow and a horse with potato ground
To keep a cow is very necessary because milk is a very nourishing article in a family where young children are brought up
It is peats that we generally use on this island as fuel
The peats are now so much run out and consumed except in inaccessible patches of moss land that fishermen would require the use of a pony to carry home their peats
The farmer do not go about here as they do on the east coast with a cart selling peats  neither does the dairyman go about selling a pennyworth of milk the coal merchant does not go about here selling half a cwt of coal
Therefore unless the fisherman has land here he cannot obtain any of those above described articles
I should also say that the fishcurers who visit this island ought to receive every encouragement from Government as they are the only means of giving work to the inhabitants of the island particularly when successfulmen women and children
The encouragement I mean is the extension of the wire from Loch Boisdale to Castle Bay whereby they would learn the state of the English Scotch and continental markets and the fishing of the different Hebridean stations
The scarcity of land necessarily produces scarcity of fodder and provenderI mean hay and straw
When any part of their grazing gets bare the beast that grazes there naturally goes away to graze where the gras is allowed  to grow
When our patches are getting bare our horses and cattle are very apt to go over the march of the big farmerthat march which is neither stonedyke nor fenceand the consequence is that the beast is taken by the farmers servant by order of the farmer and put into a pound
That pound is not fit for an animal the beast is up to the belly in mud and water
The farmer is not very apt to give an intimation when he pounds that beast
Sometimes there is a lapse of twentyfour hours and the consequences are great losses and deaths of animals
It also subjects the horses of this island to a local disease called tranceI mean by that that all the natural functions of the beast are suspended
It shakes and gets short of breath and loses all selfcommand and dies in a little whileof which I have seen instances
Again arising from the same cause we are obliged to live in thatched houses and we are obliged to make application to Dr MGillivray for bent grass to thatch our houses
We have to labour twelve clays for two small cartloads of that bent and in many instances the application is refused
We thought of late and we had great hopesthat our holdings would be enlarged on account of Lady Gordon Cathcart and her factor receiving back the lease from Mr MLellan Vatersay but it happened unfortunately that we did not get the chance
That is all my voluntary statement
Yes
There was an old widow woman in a township of this parish called Earsary
The ground officer and other estate officials came and took away a fine heifer about three years old I believe for the matter of s or so in the name of rent
They did not proceed very far when they met with a native of this island who they thought had money and they asked him if he would buy that heifer
He said he did not know
They said they would give him a bargain of it
He said he did not know if he had enough money to buy the beast
 Oh you need not be afraid we will give you a bargain
Then when he thought he would get a  bargain he bought the beast
They then invited him back to a shebeen and drank the proceeds and the man is within the walls of this building at this very moment
That is more than I can state but we can get the information from the man who is within the house
Yes she did not get credit for the proceeds
Yes
There was a man named Donald Mackinnon living in the township of Tangasdale Michael  and the ground officer I refer to was John MGregor
Buchanan
Yes the same ground officer
He came to this mans house and asked him for a stirk
Well the man could scarcely refuse him for he knew the consequences too well if he did refuse himthere was a staff of legal officers along with himand he gave the stirk
They then went to some house in the neighbourhood and drank whisky there for a good long time and then they asked the man would he buy the stirk for s
He said he had not s
 Oh yes you must have s we know you have s
 No says the man but the mans wife being within reach of hearing she used to weave with one of those handloomshad s and she went and bought the animal for s and the s was paid there and then
The value of the animal was not carried to the mans credit and the man is present here
Yes
Yes
Yes I was present one day in North Bay inn about sixteen years ago and I saw a man belonging to Bravaig going in
His name was Murdoch Mackinnon
Mr Birnie told him he had not paid his rent last year and the man said he had
Mr Birnie said he had not
He was rather a hasty man in temper and the man was very certain he had paid his rent and he was a little bolder
He was obliged to leave the house
He went away in my presence and came back panting having by good luck fallen in with the receipt
Mr Birnie took the receipt and pulled a shilling out of his pocket and said  Here you can drink this shilling
The man is here
Yes
No otherwise he would have been obliged to pay
Yes for his trouble in going there
It does not
I believe about twelve years ago
Perfect freedom so far as I know
Well last yearI am not exactly sure whether it was last year or the year beforeI saw a little
I saw a man who was obliged to go back to the township of Kentangaval because Mr Barron the new factor told him he had not paid last years rent
He was a young lad who represented his mother
He had to go back for the receipt
I dont mean to say that I only  mean to say I have seen it done
They are not gathered at all at present
Still to befound in the same quantities
Not gathered anywhere within the boundaries of this parish that I am aware of
Want of demand in the English market
In former years it was the case but now the people are generally employed elsewhere
I never saw them used for food for the last twelve or thirteen years
The proprietor never imposed any difficulty on the contrary Mr Birnie when factor was very much against doing so
Against prohibiting them
Yes
Yes
I cannot exactly say as to that
I understand that the chief factor on this estate is present and he is a man who knows more about that than I do only I feel the want of it as well as any other man
Yes
It does
In the same degree if not increasing
So far as known to me
Not that I am aware of
Not in the whole island
Only the case on one because it is on one farm only that the bent grass grows in sufficient quantity
It grows upon other farms but not to such an extent
It is so scarce that they cannot supply us with it
It is only against the one tacksman that the complaint is made for he only can supply it
There is heather enough
I have had complaints about heather
We use it to roof our houses and  I have heard different complaints about that but I never heard any labour asked in return for the heather
Not that I ever heard unless we went over the marches into those big farms
If we did they would ask some payment for it otherwise some labour
We would not be at liberty to take it away on our cart
No unless sanctioned by themselves
I have heard of their refusing liberty but I never heard of any case where they charged money
On the west side
About thirtysix families of crofters and the exact number of cottars I cannot tell
The township was founded about sixty years ago and made into fourteen crofts
It is now made into eighteen and these crofts are in several instances inhabited by four and in general by two
They are equal in size but not equal in quality of land and are at different rents
The half of a croft
My forefathers had the same land for the last fifty years
During the runrig system my  grandfather had a great part of the present croft and this present croft consists of about eight acres and we occupy the half of that croft
Yes

We have only our own part of a small hill I cannot exactly tell the acreage of it but it is on the common pasture of the parish for all townships on the east west south and north
It is a central place
There was in former times but I cannot exactly say what it was
We have two cows a heifer and two working ponies
They do in proportion but as I have mentioned some of the crofts are not the same rent owing to their not being of the same quality
Some pay more rent than we do that have the same acreage and some pay  less than we do that have the same acreage
They have
It has but if the population of Borv were restricted to the local increase of the place there would be quite sufficient land for them but the township of Borv was the only place where they were huddled into from other places at the time these were cleared
There were fourteen from Green and Cliad  two from Cregston a township lying contiguous to Borv and three from Ollosdale
All with the exception of the increase of men belonging naturally to the place
These men came into the township thirtyfive years ago
Up to the present Whitsunday Ollosdale was occupied by Donald Macdonald who succeeded his father Archibald MacDonald for whom that township was cleared Green and Cliad are Dr MGillivrays and those men who came from Cregston were replaced by men from other townships
I mean that Cregston is for the present occupied by crofters
I believe it is let to six or seven men
Crofters
James Mackinnon Neil Galbraith Malcolm MLeod and Alexander MLean were taken from Borv  and Alexander Galbraith from Scalladale and the parish minister the Rev
Alexander Macdonald has got another croft and the miller has got another
They were crofters
The croft which James Mackinnon occupied is let to two other men now
I believe one of these men was removed from his own and his own was given to another man Donald Cameron
Donald Cameron held half a croft and that was given to a man who was along with him and the other man who was occupying the second half had owned lands before
I believe Kenneth MCuish got a bigger croft because another man was removed
That is the only benefit that I know of
The only case that I know of
Only one that I am aware ofHugh MLeanwho got half a croft
I understand he was a cottar  before
I did not consult the mens mind as to that but for my own part I believe the rest of them would be removed to any part of the parish where their condition would be better
I believe their condition would be better either at Poll or Kilbarr or Scarival or Vaslin or Cliad or Ardvore or Orradh or Bogachnaforla or Rulisor Sandray or Vatersay or Uy or Caolas or Bentangaval
Some of them are presently in the possession of Dr MGillivray and others in the possession of Roderick MLellan and the present tacksman of Vatersay is Donald MDonald
That is so
Yes
Both
Whenever he wants service to be done there are some families in which there are no males and in such  cases the women go and work
I only say he takes sixty days average for an acre of land but in small odd cases women are working as well as men
I dont think he does
If one man does not do it eight do
No but each takes the planting of a barrel of potatoes and we always calculate an acre to plant  about eight barrels
Sometimes we get about eight barrels ten or twelve in a good year and some years hardly double the seed put in
Eight ten and sometimes twelve for the one barrel but in a great many cases not double the quantity of the seed we plant
In an ordinarily good season we get generally eight or nine barrels
In extra seasons we get about that
I cannot say how long it is since he occupied the farm of Eoligary but I should say it is thirtyfive or thirtysix years since he got all these places I have mentioned
I cannot say
I represent about thirtysix crofters
The whole number of crofters in the township of Borv
From the township of Borv
They were employed elsewhere only they gave their consent
They gave their consent in such a form as this  As we have to go elsewhere to attend our  respective services we give you our consent to elect whom you like
I cannot exactly say whether it was or not
They all go to work
Whenever the bills came here and were posted up the news went rapidly through the whole parish of Barra and they commenced to gather from the different cantonments
They were there from our township as many as were necessary and there was a meeting held in the classroom and the question was put to them and they said they were there representing those who remained at home as well as those who had come
That was all I saw present
The bills were posted on a Saturday and as hurriedly as we could we passed the word through the parish and as many gathered here as could
A great many were not coming to the island till Sunday morning
That was all the time
I tell you I saw the bill on the Saturday but a great many of them did not and I intimated seeing such a bill and told them to do something to meet the Royal Commission
I partly refer to a period before I was born and that upon good authority but in general to the period after I was born
I think I have stated all the acts of oppression voluntarily that I can presently remember
There was another particular case belonging to the township I represent  can scarcely call it a very hard case
There was a woman named Isabella MLauchlan in Borv about two years ago who had sublet a bit of land and she wanted the use of the whole of the land herself
The woman to whom she had sublet the land would not part with it and the matter became a factors affair and I believe the factor said it would be better they should settle it themselves otherwise he would turn out the woman who had been first in  possession of the land
Then Isabella MLauchlans son went to pay the rent and John Macdonald refused to receive it on account I believe of noncompliance with the factors request
I believe the woman got a  removal summons but of late years she was reinstated in half of the croft by Mr Macdonald the chief factor
She was removed but she got another croft
Not a great case of hardship when I saw the woman get the land
I say he did
He did not do that
He was afraid that if he did so he would be worse off and only double his own misfortune
You know that best your Honour only I had to state it
Yes
There were some men whose stock was cleared completely away and some men to whom perhaps a cow or so was left
There is a man in the township of Tangasdale from whom nine head of cattle were taken that same year
A great many do not possess cows
My occupation was crofting and fishing
All my life
I have often been away but I never remained a year away without visiting it
Yes some of them did
The crofters of the township of Glen did and a deputation went and waited upon  the chief factor Mr Macdonald in Aberdeen
I am not aware of that
I did
I cannot exactly say in what year but it went on here during the late Colonel Gordons time and abundantly in the time of the late General M Neill
It did
I do not think it was  it was partly
I attribute it to the following reasons to the famine that followed the failure of the potato crop coupled with the doings of the factors studying not the interest of the crofters or cottars
I think so
I can safely say there is
Yes
Yes on the same land and mostly in the same house
It was the late General M NeillR oderick MNeillthe sixth Roderick M Neill
It was not sold it was let by the late General M Neill
About fortytwo or fortythree years ago
There were
About thirtyfive or thirtysix years ago
Not that I am aware of except from Poll and Kilbarr
You are quite safe in doing so
Heartrending
I have seen with my own eyes the roof of the house actually falling down upon the fire and smoke issuing
Yes
I have seen that stated in public prints
Occasionally but not very often
I believe two or three per cent got on pretty fair but the rest we receive very bad accounts of
Two hundred men so far as I am aware
In former times the Barra estate extended as far as North Boisdale
Yes to the north march of Boisdalethe march of Boisdale and Kilphedar
Yes
There was a man named Webster
I think he was a south country man
No so far as I remember he was not a Highlander
I never heard him speaking Gaelic
The next was a man named Robertson
He was a stranger alsoI think a Perthshire man
The next was a man named Clark a stranger then there were Fleming Young George Gordon John Rule William Birnie then Drever Taylor Barron and now Mr Forbes Phillips
Yes
I forgot to mention Dr MLeod who was not a stranger but a very well known gentleman
Yes at the same time
Yes and Mr Macdonald into the bargain
He is not a stranger
No his name was Barron
He left lately and Mr Phillips succeeded him
I think they did
I was not present and did not hear it
It may have been in another place but I was present when subscriptions were received
I did not hear
I am not aware of that
I have heard that Mr Walker South Uist made such a remark
Yes
The value of a mans labour here among big farmers is a shilling
Yes
I do
I suppose he occupies about  acres
None that I am aware of except shepherds and servants
He has seven shepherds besides his own domestic servants
I cannot exactly say 
Pretty well on to the half of the island and the best half
The other islands
It was advertised in the newspapers to be let
No they went to wait upon Mr Macdonald the chief factor at Aberdeen
Three
No
I believe they considered themselves quite transported as they were but they wanted to get over there to better their condition
They wanted to go and live there
I cannot say but I believe mostly all inhabitants of Glen and Castle Bay
They are not exactly two towns
This bight is Castle Bay and the contiguous township is Glen
I dont think they did
It is very rocky and rugged and the green patches which there are are very bleak barren and sterile ground
Yes
The finest land on the island
I heard that but I do not think it is true
I think they did  but I am aware of three spring wells there which with a little labour would supply  water to the island
I cannot say it was only once I ever saw her here
I cannot exactly say whether she did or not
It grows naturally and grew naturally
It was never planted in that place
Yes and the more cutting among the bent the better growth
It merely encourages growth
I cannot say if it was not to get his own work done at as little expense as he could
Yes
Not that I am aware of
No we have not and I will tell you how
It is cast seaware that we get
It is very much owing to the drift and is more liable to be drawn ashore on the strand adjacent to the big farm
Yes
About eight sheep
They do
Yes
No we do not take any notice of them
That is a question I cannot exactly answer
They come equally our way
Yes
I account for it in this way that if I had anything against Dr MGillivray perhaps I might have to go to him for a favour tomorrow and it is not very likely I would get it
Yes
I cannot say whether he would or not
He objected before
The factor did not
I was several times away from the island but I never remained away from the island the whole year
Yes under Mr Arbuckle the parish schoolmaster
Very much the same
It was the general opinion of the people here that the account in the public prints was true because they attributed a great deal to the treatment they saw the men getting before they emigrated at all
Yes  there was a Spaniard lying wrecked on the strand adjacent to Tangasdale
Well the very man I refer to who took the cattle forcibly away made the men work about that ship
She was loaded with fish and the fish became quite useless  and the people thought they could make use of the fish
They were not allowed to do that until such time as it was mostly taken away by the tide  but I believe he made them labour a great deal about that ship and never gave them wagesat least I understood that from the men who worked
No
It may be attributed to it
I dont think it is
Given back to his wife
Yes they were all drinking andI believe they were there for a good long time the following morning
No
I have also to state in conclusion that there was a very severe remark passed one day we came to Castle Bay to meet the chief factor
There were some gentlemen present who called us privatelybut I was within hearing Fenians and we were not very well pleased to hear ourselves called Fenians
We do not like the name
Not in the least I am not an Irishman neither have I imbibed their notions
None all to the east coast
The medical practitioner of this island
No they are very simple harmless people
He goes nowhere for an agent
In particular cases they might apply to the procuratorfiscal
Yes
I cannot eay but I know it is bringing very unnecessary expense upon them
None except a man of business whose name I think is Wilson and if I remember right they are in company
That is all I understand about it
For my part I would take about two days going there
I would by far
None whatever
They did not interfere in any way only they were very encouraging to us by coming and sitting along with the people
He was present
I am quite prepared to say that and it was quite a legal affair and we kept a copy of the sederunt
A merchants clerk
Owing to the position in which the people are it was ever a very prevalent idea on this island that they would have to obey their superiors particularly landlords and factors and I believe should they wish to do anything they could scarcely do it without consulting either landlord or factor whether to their own benefit or to the reverse
Principally in Portree
Yes
I am not going to enter into the several grievances of the crofters  the Commission having had ample evidence of that from themselves but I  wish to state before the Commission though it may not exactly come  within their province but which affects the prosperity of this romantic  village that with one or two exceptions house property here is only  held on a ninetynine yearslease and at the expiry of each lease the  property becomes the absolute property of the landlord and his heirs
Is  not this confiscation of property
What encouragement is there for  improvements under such conditions
I concur generally with the evidence  adduced before you with regard to the oppression and chronic poverty of  a great portion of the people
I am in a position to know a great deal  of the circumstances of the people my late father having been for  upwards of forty years an extensive meal dealer and general merchant  here my brother and I having succeeded him
I have no doubt whatever in  stating that the condition of the people generally is gradually getting  worse and that they are now in a much worse position than they were  thirty or forty years ago
In fact a large proportion of them are  practically bankrupt and if some measures are not adopted to ameliorate  their condition a number of them will soon be chargeable to the parish   indeed if it were not for remittances from relations outside Skye a  proportion of them would have succumbed ere now
This was far from  being the case forty years ago the people then being in comparatively  easy circumstances owing little or nothing but are now deeply in debt
Their present condition is due to the insecurity and insufficiency of  their holdings and the deprivation of their hill pasture and the  huddling together of large numbers of them on unproductive land to make  room for sheep and deer
The chronic poverty prevalent in the land is  mostly if not wholly due to the unequal distribution of the land the  most and the best of which is in the hands of a few
There is sufficient  land in Skye to support in comparative comfort the present population  it supported a much larger one before and not a tithe of the food now  imported was required to be imported then
The land then was under  cultivation it is not so now
All that is necessary to remedy this sad  state of matters is a redistribution of the land giving each family as  much arable and pasture land as will keep it in comparative comfort and  then to apply the principles of the Irish Land Act by fixing fair rents  and giving security of tenure
Nothing short of this will allay  agitation restore contentment and satisfy the just demands of the  people
What need I speak of emigration as a cure for the present  condition of the people when the Highlands have been all but  depopulated and when the condition of those left behind has not  improved in consequence as is apparent in presence of tho condition of  many parts of the country when the cry of hunger and of deep and  widespread distress is heard in various parts of the land and but for  the contributions of charity and public alms many of the people would  have perished from want
It is not true that in the Highlands at least  the people have pressed on the limits of subsistence and that the only  remedy is emigration
There are thousands of acres in Skye fit for  cultivation growing little else than fog and brakens
What is wanted is  migration
The time is gone bye when the welfare and natural rights of  the people can be sacrificed to any parchment rights the landlords may  possess
I for one have no fear of the issue once their political power  is conceded to which the present Government is pledged that the  people will work out their own salvation
Put the people in possession  of the land from which they and their forefathers were removed and ways  and means will hot be wanting to stock the land
I hold that land  being limited in extent should not be dealt with on commercial  principles
This is not a question of mere rent it is one involving the  wellbeing of the people even of their very existence
Among all the  Acts passed by the lords of the soil I am not aware of one to preserve  the people but there are many on the statute book to preserve game and  deer
I hear a great deal of the evils of absenteeism what will it  benefit the crofters on Lord Macdonalds estate by his Lordship residing  on his property
Simply nothing
Major Fraser who got a comfortable  and fairly prosperous tenantry resided a great deal on his estate has  that benefited his tenantry
I appeal from their former to their present  condition
I am satisfied that as regards Skye at least where the  proprietor is resident the people are in greater subjection and bondage
Let the people ask for no more charity but let them demand their  rights
If the money spent by the late Government in fixing a scientific  frontier had been applied instead in bettering the condition of the  people matters would not now be as they are
Let the Liberal  Government who has shown so much solicitude concerning the Egyptians  grapple with this question and restore their rights to a noble loyal  patriotic lawabiding but downtrodden people
I think it a mistake  however to consider the crofter question as a mere local question  affecting only the crofter population and that can be settled by  remedies that have only a surface and local application
It involves the  great social problem of modern civilisation viz the institution of  private property in land the ownership by some of the people of the  land on which and from which the whole must live
It is this system  that produces the destitution in the Highlands and the hideous squalor  of our city slums it involves the problem of the distribution of  wealth
Is not labour the source of all wealth
without it you have no  wealth How comes it then that the creators of this wealth get but the  barest living of it
Manifestly owing to the ownership in the natural  agent laud
Is not rent the devourer of wages or in other words the  earnings of labour
This is the system that keeps the masses of mankind  mere hewers of wood and drawers of water for the benefit of a fortunate  few who reap where they do not sow and appropriate to themselves  wealth which they had no share in producing
This is the question worth  fighting for and not any mere local one which is only iu the interests  of a class it is universal in its application benefiting equally  every man woman and child within the realm
I have not
I am very sorry to say that I am not prepared to do anything of the kind for I did not know that I was to be called forward
If you ask me any questions that I can answer I will be very glad to do so
That is by extending them round the island
What we have on lease we cannot improve much more but what he means to say as I understandI never knew anything about that till I heard Mr Darroch read itis that if he was lessee of more of the Skye shores he would extend the fishing still further and that would give more employment
He would take them if he could get them but proprietors are not willing to go into the affair
No
Yes because I know he has tried
We have Major Frasers shore Lord Macdonalds shore and part of John Lawson Macleod of Macleods
No
No
We might slip parts of the island
No there is no fishing on the island but ours
We employ one hundred and ten fishermen
They are all natives except myself and my son
I cannot say exactly in the meantime
It would depend upon our success in opening up those fishings
We employ one hundred and ten and we might perhaps add another fifty or perhaps another hundred
It would only improve the shore that is lying waste
We would have to bring more to the icehouse as we would be putting out more expense
That is all
We do not consider that we would diminish the fish on the ground we are fishing
No I dont believe that
No supposing there were other one hundred and ten men fishing as strong as we do
Oh the sea is wide between here and America
Yes  besides the men I have mentioned we have four carts driving to us and a small steamer
Yes and more material put out
Yes
Yes
I intended to enter into a more lengthy statement as to the management of property generally statistics c than I think it now necessary owing to the very valuable and exhaustive statement made by my friend Mr Macdonald yesterday and I will merely say that generally I agree with and can corroborate his statements
I have already made a statement before the Commissioners at Isle Ornsay in respect of matters in Sleat and before entering into another statement I want to say that I find on minute inquiry that I may have been mistaken when denying that a notice had been put up to the inn doors as to a rent to be charged against shops
If these notices were put up it was done purely through my clerk mistaking my instructions as to which I will further explain if necessary
I must add that there was never any intention to charge for such shops at Glendale where notices were put up and it was not done nor did the notice prevent shops being opened and during my holding office several additional small shops were opened in Sleat Strath and elsewhere where if the notice was put up it was through a stupid mistake
I shall now touch upon the evidence given by the other delegates who I may say made erroneous statements to use a mild term and I hope I am not out of order in doing so
Well Donald MInnes delegate Duisdale in Sleat said his township had been deprived of two pieces of hill land which was added to a tack and no deduction given
This is a downright falsehood
This man had never an inch of land of his own during my recollection but when the lease of the farm of Knock fell out about Whitsunday  I cut off a considerable portion and put it under crofters
Four new crofters got shares and of these Donald MInnes is one
He had not a farthing to take the croft but I have myself given him two cows worth   to   each
His rent is about  s his summing two cows and a horse and he also keeps sheep
Besides feeding his two cows and their followers on the produce of his lot he sells yearly a considerable quantity of corn or takes in stock to consume it
I will try to do so but facts are stubborn things
I come next to Donald Beaton Carradale who said he had paid   for arrears due by a former tenant
I have looked up the estate ledger and find there was no arrear against the former tenant further than she left value for
This was made over to Beaton  it was a very small matter altogether and he did not actually pay one penny of arrears
I may add that no tenant was evicted in Sleat during my tenure of office nor since but I put several tenants in possession that never had lands before and helped them myself personally in taking lands
I shall now proceed to the parish of Strath
I heard very little of the evidence taken here but I understand the crofters of Breakish stated that they had been deprived of hill land
This is false I hope that is not too strong
Well I go on to Peter MKinnon delegate
His evidence must be taken for what it is worth and it is quite worthless
This man has shown towards me the most marked animosity for some years and if the Commissioners think proper I shall be glad to state the cause of it
MKinnon found fault with me as factor and justice of the peace and as general wellwisher of the people for deciding some little squabbles between them and him
There are two cases which I unfortunately decided against him
He had engaged a boats crew to fish lobsters for him and two young men of the crew were drowned
MKinnon came to me with the statement that he had a claim against the lads
Very well I shall do so but perhaps you will allow me to make a remark about this case because it is very important for me and I think for the country generally
Your Lordship has no doubt seen a notice which I put up as to landing on the shores of the estate
Well in the newspapers it was alleged or insinuated that this boats crew lost their lives through not having liberty to land upon the coast
Now this boats crew was lost several years before the notice referred to was issued and there had been no previous notice of the nature I speak of
Yes
I am very glad to hear it
There never was any intention of anything of the kind
Perhaps the notice was not judiciously worded perhaps I did it in a hurry or in a fit of temper or some other way  but it was made an unfortunate handle against me
I come now to John MLean Hamaravirran
He got possession of his present lot having urgently requested to be removed from Ramasaig to the lot of an old woman who was quite unable to keep it and who now gets a cows keep and potato land ad libitum on the proprietors farm for which she pays nothing
John Campbell delegate from  Hamaraverran has made several statements as to grievances which with the exception of that referring to his quarrel with me for his harbouring Land Leaguers are incorrect and unfounded
This man I always considered a very respectable hardworking man
He was very poor when I first went to Glendale
I befriended him in every possible way and doubled his lot
I would not be afraid now to give him four times as much land so far as means go
The influence of evil doctrine on the general body of the crofters can easily be imagined when this man whom I knew to be previously friendly and respectful was carried away to be most insolent and offensive
Allan Macaskill Faasach late tenant at Ramasaig has also misstated his case I draw it very mild
As to John Macphersons statements I can only say that I am much astonished that a man of his seeming intelligence should be carried away in the stream of rebellion and it has all arisen from the evil influence of agitators
The Skiniden tenants also made misstatements
I will gladly answer questions as to these
I dont think there is any occasion for my troubling the honourable Commissioners further on this part of the evidence but will gladly answer any questions in respect of anything or all that has been said at Glendale and particularly as to Waterstein
I am extremely sorry to find that the people denied the existence of a Land League and a knowledge of the notices which were being put up
I can speak personally as to both having seen some of the notices and I believe they are still to be found
As to their being bound by a league there is plenty evidence to prove that they said and believed they were under such a bond for they repeatedly said to me that they were so and sworn to stand by each other against all law and against all force till their demands were complied with
Their actions at that time and subsequently are sufficient though if required plenty more would be forthcoming
I may say in passing that a very marked and great improvement has taken place and is going on in the condition of the crofters houses at Glendale
I think this must be apparent to any unbiassed visitor to the place and more than one credible and observant proprietor has remarked to me on the comparative increase in this respect but I suppose this too will be put down by some as factorial oppression and poverty
As to the general condition of the people the people on Lord Macdonalds property are most undoubtedly far better off than they were thirty or forty years ago
I am certain their improvement during that period has been decided and progressive
Some years of course they are better off than others owing to a prosperous fishing better seasons better prices and from other causes
It is true that they have had now three successive bad seasons and on many of them this must have a serious effect
I may state causes to show how they must be far better off now than formerly
In my own recollection wages in general have doubled in many cases quadrupled prices for Highland cattle the samesheep the same
I will be glad to give present and past prices
The expenses of the people have grown along with their improved circumstances and perhaps in some cases have outstepped the increased income
I dont think it is any exaggeration to say that generally the families expend as much now in the simple article of tea and sugar as their forefathers did in oatmeal
Many intelligent men among them have often stated so to me
They have also other luxuries never dreamt of twenty or thirty years ago
How do they dress now in comparison to then
Who can find fault with them
I certainly dont and the better they are to do the better I should be pleased
I remember when a man thought he paid a lot out for what they call shop produce if he paid  or the best of them up to  now double these amounts and even treble them and it is quite common and they can buy their supplies far cheaper now than formerly
I never hear or see now of people going to gather the common shellfish of the coast to tide over the scarce season
In my first recollection this was too common and done to a very great extent all over the country  and as a proof of what I say let any one show me now from the point of Sleat to Portree a single heap of shells near a tenants house that would fill a cartload but let them try the sites of former dwellings and not one of those but will prove my statement
I could state a great deal more on this head if necessary
The land by overcropping has no doubt deteriorated but however well farmed the land will not give good crops of grain
This is much owing to climate
I may be wrong but looking back to my youuger days and from what I hear others say I think the climate is certainly not improving but decidedly getting worse and I myself gave up cropping a large extent of good arable land in the very best condition at Ostaig owing to its not paying
That farm was in the very highest state of cultivation
It was cultivated on the fivecourse shift and I limed it anrl manured it in every way and made it so far as I could a model farm
I had to give it up because I was losing money by it
It is nonsense for the crofters to maintain that their poverty is owing to such causes and they are quite aware that their grain crop is much more valuable as food for their cattle than for meal making and I am quite certain were they able to grow more corn and better grain it would still all go in feeding cattle
I should like to ask the bankers in Portree to whom the greatest portion of the deposits in their respective banks belong
I am credibly informed these amount close to if not over  I can only state that I have no deposits myself and I think I may fairly say that most if not all of my brother tenant farmers are not in a very much better position and I am afraid the proprietors are not the best supporters of the banks either in that respect
I come now to what may be too much of a personal thing but I have been so much abused lately that I should like to make a few remarks about myself and to bring out some things I should like the Commissioners to know
A deal has been said as to my dealings in meal
Well I did deal in meaL but not to my profit
I was driven into it and I could easily prove this and satisfactorily
I have I believe now outstanding for meal  A very great part of this I dont expect to recover but had I done what many others have done and taken joint bills for these amounts and I could have easily got the people to give them I would have been safe but many a poor man would be ruined
I never to my recollection in my life took a bill from a tenant for meal and I disapprove much of the system which though almost unknown in my end of the country is common in many places
I never charged in any one case interest on my account and with all my dealings with the people
I am not aware of ever having a man n in court for debt nor have I allowed any harsh measures to be used
It has been said that meal mills were put down by me
Well the mills of Strath and Sleat were in disuse long prior to my entry into office
Where there were mills they remain still and in better order than when I found them
I may remark that what millers charge for grinding is onetwentieth of the corn ground
It has been said that I am rich at the expense of the crofters
Well I have looked particularly into the state of my affairs and I find I was a poorer man the year I resigned Lord Macdonalds factorship than I was the year I took it
I have not as much land now on Lord Macdonalds property as I had the year I entered on the factorship
There are eight years to run of my lease of Tormore and Ostaig and if Lord Macdonald would kindly relieve me of this I would willingly give it over and it would form a good field for tenants deserving of more land and able to take it
I hope I will be pardoned for saying what I have said about myself
I hope it will not appear egotistical because I have been driven into doing this by the way I have of late been maligned by anonymous writers of articles in Radical newspapers and other like publications
I am sorry I do not stand alone in that respect but I have come in for a greater share than my fair due
My principal reason for bringing this matter forward is to try and show who have been the chief movers in abusing me and stirring up the whole country to rebellion
I know that this proceeds very much from outside agitators and I care not what they say or write but I am distressed and grieved that a few of my own good countrymen have been instigated to speak against me when I certainly did not deserve it at their hands
I have done my very utmost to keep down the price of meal and to keep up the price of cattle
Naturally the dealers in these must owe me a grudge and I daresay they do
I care not for that
I have done my duty  and I believe were it not for my keeping a large supply of meal and opening an opposition store that there would have been real cases of starvation
I know there would have been
I could prove this were it required
There is one letter that is rather original
I could show fifty but this is original and comes from rather a curious source
It comes from the great Skye poetess who I am sorry to hear has been going about with rather curious company
May I ask Sheriff Nicolson who is up in Skye matters to read it
He need not read it publicly but I shall be gratified if he looks at it
Well now I am done
Who are the chief instigators of this and the rebellion in Skye and the west
I can lay my finger on them at once and will name them if the Royal Commission give the same guarantee of protection as the crofters have asked for and got from the poor unfortunate factors
Well if your Lordship will allow me to state the names I will take the risk of my life
I am not a coward and let them fire away at me
I am much obliged to your Lordship for letting me know that my name has been used but I was quite prepared for it
I have had so many kicks of late that it is a wonder I was not kicked into kingdom come
If it is any satisfaction to the Commissioners and to the people assembled here that I should state my opinion as to the agitators who are the cause of this rebellion I shall be glad to do so
Well my Lord I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the literature that was distributed among the people of this country was the first mover in this unfortunate rebellion and without naming many I will name the principal paper that came here and that was the famous but fortunately now defunct Highlander
The editor of the Highlander I believe is still alive and going about
I saw in one of the papers that he was to be down here educating the people in rebellion
I have not seen him but I am not sorry he is not here
Well I will pass him overhe is not worth powder and I will come to No Mr MHugh the secretary of the Irish Land Reform Association in Glasgow
Then comes No  the last but not the leastand certainly if the others have to answer for a lot of sins he has to answer for a great many more
He has got a broad back and a very thick hide His name is Dean of Guild Mackenzie
I beg your Lordships pardon
I hope I have not committed contempt of court
Well I should be sorry to come down to Mr Mackenzies station and give him kicks in the way he has kicked me but it is rather hard not to give a kick occasionally
Now Mr Mackenzie if this Commission is to go on you will decidedly be one of the Commissioners they could not get on without youOh he said  that too is about settled
Well I have stated who the principal agitators are in my belief but I am sorry to say that I believe there are in our own country local agitators
I am very sorry for that and I am very sorry indeed to bring the matter forward and perhaps I should not bring it forward and perhaps I am doing it injudiciously
I shall be very glad however to answer any questions that may be put to me
I have the farm of Ostaig
Properly speaking that embraces the whole  but these are several farms put together and for reasons best known to themselves newspapers have made out that I have five or six
I have simply nothing in Skye except Tormore and Ostaig
They are
The rental is about  just now taking off a piece that I was allowed to sublet to a man and the area that I farm is close on  acres
I had the island of Pabbay in Strath for one or two years
 or  was the largest rent I ever paid
Not above  acres
My father and his family had Tormore for a long time
It was
I read a letter in which I stated that I had been invited to come forward and give an offer for that farm for the whole land they possessed
I did come forward and was accepted as tenant but I never became the tenant
I withdrew from it when the people got up in this rebellious state
I never became tenant of it
There was six hundred or seven hundred or eight hundred sheep of mine came from my farm in Nairnshire with a view to stock it if the people would not interfere
I was very much afraid they would interfere but the trustees held me to my bargain under the understanding that if they could not implement their share of the bargain they would take the stock which I took there at a valuation
Never a complete one
The term day is the th and so far as I remember the sheep came there on the very term day
The people would not allow the sheep on at least prevented them going on part of the ground and therefore the trustees could not implement their bargain with me and I simply walked out of it and my stock was taken bv the trustees at a valuation and put on the ground at their risk and as their property
It is now their property
I have not the slightest interest in the property or in the stock
All from Lord Macdonald in the Island of Skye
At Glendale not one single case of eviction
There were many cases in which tenants removed voluntarily to other portions of the estate
There were two men on the small farm of Lowergil who would have preferred I believe to stop but the proprietor did not see fit that they should remain there because four of the other tenants had removed or were removing of their own free will
The man Shaw was one of the two that wanted to remain
They were not my farms at all I never had a farm there
The case of the Carradale tenants came up
There were four tenants there and they were transferred from small holdings into larger holdings
There were
That was the only case
Certainly not every one of them whatever they may say today was anxious to be removed from that place because it was four miles away from a public road
There was no school there was no road there was no fence of any kind
If they went to buy a boll of meal they had to carry it on their back four miles
It is natural to suppose that they would not like to live in a place of that kind
Not the very least and there was one tenant of a farm rented at  who came to me and said Though I am giving up this place I may come back  my son is in Edinburgh in a good position and we may wish to take it
I said You will get back your lot at any time  and if the people are turned out of it you will get the whole of it
This was said a long time ago and I am quite ready she should come forward now and take it
I was driven on to take it
It was because I could not get another tenant for it that I took it myself and as matter of fact in its immediate neighbourhood I sublet to a man a farm six times the extent of this little bit at Carradale
It does not stand to reason that I should turn these tenants out to make room for myself when I was very glad to get quit of another piece of fully more proportional value
Not in my occupancy  not one inch
As regards the report I saw in the papers and which several others saw I tried to get hold of a paper today but there are plenty of witnesses here who say that Shaw said that he had left Lowergilthat he was pressed out of Lowergil that he knew what factors were and rather abused factors but one specific thing he mentioned was that he had left without being paid for the value of his houses
I talked to him last night for saying such a thing and he said he had never said it and he would be the last to say it
I believe Shaw is here and I shall be glad if you ask him the question
Neil Shaw Mr Macdonald said to me yesterday that it was stated in the papers that I said I had got nothing for the houses when I left Lowergil what I said was that there was not a penny of arrears against me at that time
Mr Macdonald
I have a copy here of the account under which I settled with Shaw and I shall be very glad to read itsee Appendix A
XXIV
Very well all I want is that the facts should come out
That is my candid and decided opinion
No doubt it does
It is apt to increase lazy habits and there is no doubt of the fact that if a man goes out in the morning and gets drenched to the skin it is not very likely he will work the other part of the day
Well they might do a great deal in improving their land that they do not do and the most of them will admit that themselves
They could do a great deal in draining and in improving the land
In spite of the weather
There is no doubt the weather is a bar in the way but it is more a bar in the way of raising a good crop because the amount of moisture in the soil prevents it ever coming to a good head
It ripens but the weight of grain is not there and when it is ripe a storm may come and do a lot of damage and that is very often the case
Well I dont know these were the words I used
I did not say it was extravagance
I said there was a very large amount of money spent on tea and there is no denying the fact and what I said was that many a man spent nowadays on tea and sugar what his forefathers did not spend on meal
I cannot see that milk can be scarcer now than it was in the time of their forefathers
Well that is my opinion
I dont think that can be denied
I cannot say
The store and land attached at Isle Ornsay are not exactly the store and land held by Kennedy
I cannot exactly say but I know there was a very considerable rise upon it
I cannot say for certain but it was supposed he made a very large amount of money there
I believe he lost a great deal of money
I believe he was at one time
I may state that the place was valued at  so far as I remember I may be wrong a pound or two
Fraser was offered the place at the increased rent  Moreover he offered  for the place and I may mention that it was not with me that Fraser was treating because I thought it was better he should treat with Lord Macdonalds Edinburgh agent Thomas Brodie WS
He and I were not on very good terms
I cannot say we were on bad terms but I had put up an opposition mealstore to his and we did not pull so well together as we had done at one time
He did
I was
I dont know I was
That may have been part of my business but very likely I had a great deal of business to do besides that
I should not have gone simply on that business
By Lord Macdonalds Edinburgh agent
On my word of honour as a man and a gentleman it was not
My name never came up in it
It was given to Neil Kennedy simply
Not to the company
I stated two facts  that he was not a man of the capital that the Isle Ornsay shop required
I did help him and I never denied it
I will say that I never had an interest further than that I backed Kennedy and lent Kennedy money that I never heard of a balance sheet that I never heard of a stocktaking that I deal with the shop that I regularly pay my accounts every half year at all events that I clear my shop account with Neil Kennedy every halfyear as every tenant does that I never got a pennyworth from Kennedy without paying for it and that I never got a reduction on any article but paid for it as any ordinary tenant does
I am referring to that period and to any other you like
Yes
Unfortunately for me not one single sixpence and I may say that every penny which the people owed me then they owe me still
No I cannot
It is a very stupid document
All that I can say I have stated on my word of honour as a gentleman and I know that for their own convenience people have paid very small sums to Neil Kennedy or his clerk for me and it was most stupid for Neil Kennedy to mix up his accounts with mine when they never were mixed up in reality
They were
All over
When I say all over I should explain there were some townships that were not increased one shilling
Yes
A very considerable rise
Well I thought I stated that at Isle Ornsay but I am not sorry to state it again Lord Macdonald has small tenants in four parishes and the whole rise upon the small tenants was some  I cannot state without going into figures what the total amount of the tenants rent was but I think I stated the other day that there would be a rise of something like  per cent and I think I am not very far wrong
Well the reason of the rise was this and it was stated to the people at the time that a low country valuator an east coast man came down here to value the sheep farms
Mr MBay Elgin
He valued all the sheep farms or at least all likely to be soon out of lease my own among the rest
He put a very large increase on all the farms or nearly all of them
I think it was the next year after that that I had a conversation with Lord Macdonald who was as I stated already one of the best of men but it was natural for him to suppose that getting this large rise from his sheep farmers he might expect the same rise or some rise from his small tenants
It was in contemplation to get an east coast man to value the crofters lands
Well I said to him that I thought it would be a foolish thing and he certainly did not press the question
I said I thought if he would allow me to treat with the tenants myself the tenants and I would agree amicably about it
Well there was a report given in by some valuators confirmed by the ground officers and I made up an estimate which was put before the tenants
I will not say it has put before every tenant
It was put before the tenants who came forward to pay their rent on the regular rent clay that they were to pay this rise
I never heard a grumble the first year
They all agreed it was far better for them to pay whatever rise was put upon them directly under my own management than under the valuation of an east coast man
I think I am safe to say that if an east coast valuator had gone as a valuator of these lands there would have been a very different story for the small tenants from the rise I put on
I dont think they would have put up with it without a grumble but I am afraid they would agree to pay a rent that would be ruinous to themselves
I am afraid they would
I admit it quite candidly
Well the man may be correct but it would be a singular case
He may have been away on the occasion when I gave notice to the other tenants and told them of the rise to be put upon them  but he certainly got verbal notice of the rise of rent before he got that written notice and that was merely a formal notice he got
The intention certainly never was to remove him
It does not say that he is to remove in a few days
Well that is before the Martinmas rent collection
The meaning is to get notice in due time before the Martinmas collection which is on th November and he certainly would not write to me supposing he was going to give it up
I dont think I had a single answer to these letters but the fact is that he would come forward at the rent collection and pay his rent up to Martinmas and then he would give me notice if he did not intend to keep on after Whitsunday following because there never was a case it could not be legally doneof turning a tenant out at the Martinmas term
The notice may not be written in the strict terms in which perhaps it ought to have been but the meaning is that this man got notice that if he was displeased with his bargain he might give up possession at Whitsunday next
I never dreamed he would do it
At Whitsunday next
I am afraid I must leave it there with two illegalitiesfirst in raising the rent during the currency of the terms and then telling the people that unless they agree to pay they will be turned out in ten days
It was never raised during the currency of the terms
I did not quite state that I was unable to recover them
I said it was doubtful but I think if I were pressed into pushing them I might make them good
Yes
I forget exactly but it is a considerable time
Not necessarily
There may be a man in a township who has  in the bank and twenty men in that same township who have not a single shilling in the bank
Well the man with  in the bank may not owe me a shilling and the other nineteen may
I have not the slightest doubt of it
By all means
No I dont think it and I dont think I have said it was
There is not the least doubt about that
I never said it was and I never thought so
The reason is perfectly plain  they had not sufficient food or if they had they would not have gone to the shellfish
I have not tried it and I would not like to try it
A very great sale for whelks
I can only speak for myself I never prohibited it
I have already stated I think that I undersold other dealers
I know I undersold them sometimes by s or s per boll
Neither directly nor indirectly
Lord Macdoualds factor is here who let the farm of Knock to Neil Kennedy and he knows I was not in the country and could not possibly be consulted about the matter
I believe it is the fact that Kennedy was driven to take it
There was not much hill pasture taken from Kilmore
It is a very old story
There was a very small pendicle of a hill about three or four miles away from the township and it joined with the farm of Ord and I believe Ord was getting very much the benefit of it
It was a very narrow strip and Ord spoke to me about it
He was going to put up a fence and this piece of ground came in the way and they made an offer of it to him
It was a matter of arrangement in fact between themselves which I as factor agreed to
Ord paid  for it which I know was a very large rent and they got a proportionate reduction
A man named MInnes who once a blacksmith
Never
Never in Skye
I did not
I had not
I have often bought sheep and cattle from him as I did from other people and he has bought from me in like manner
It never was done at all but this was done that often before the markets the tenants would come to me and ask me to go and buy their cattle and I would go
Well when a man is asked to go and buy cattle off a farm one does not like to give full prices but I can safely say I always gave full prices and I do not think any one will deny that I did
I never bought a beast from anybody in regard to which I would not conscientiously swear that I gave more than value for it
The ground officer so far as I am aware never bought a cattle beast for me
Not for me
Never
I am certain it is not
Or any other official
I am not aware it is signed by any number of people or by any one in fact but as I was at Isle Ornsay the other day I met a man on the road who told me that he and his fellow townsmen and the whole of the parish or a certain number of them wanted to send some statement to the Royal Commission about the questions that had been put
I did not enter into details and I know nothing at all about it
I cannot really say
It seems to be Donald Macphersons handwriting but I dont know
I cannot speak distinctly as to the case
I think there was some row it was simply a reminder to a man to keep on his good behaviour but I will not speak positively
Yes it does I see it is a few days after the term
Possibly I had a verbal understanding with him before that but I will not speak positively see Appendix A
XXIV
Yes but it is a rumour that is generally believed
No and I dont think there is now though I dont know it so well as I did then
Well I am not sure of that
No I dont see I have anything to do with it at all
Well I think from what has been said that the inference would be that Sleat must be in a state of misery
That is the impression which is wished to be conveyed
Yes
Never
Sir John Macpherson Macleods
I cannot tell
I know it was always supposed so and I did not see it was for me to enter into explanations with other men about what was not mine
No not particularly
When did I say so
No I did not
I said I was invited by the trustees to give an offer for the farm and that I did so
I was disposed to take it because I did take it
I accepted the trustees offer and they accepted me as tenant
I suppose it was because they thought it more profitable for themselves
This place of Ramasaig was inhabited by a number of people when I took the tack of it but even before then there were vacant lots
I used to offer those vacant lots to people in the other part of Glendale and I never got a man to go to Ramasaig but when there was a vacant lot in any other part of Glendale a Ramasaig man was determined to get it
I at once stepped out of the way of their getting it and I never heard a single word from any of the tenants that they wanted it though they knew two years beforehand that it was to let
I never heard a single word from them till after I myself had taken it and the bargain was concluded and then whenever I did hear they wanted it at the first meeting I had with them I told them I would not stand in the way of their getting it
I stated to them at that meeting that if they would take my advice they would pay the rents and arrears make a specific offer for Waterstein and satisfy the trustees that they could stock it and that I would see what I could do for them
My intention was to do everything in my power for them I did not go further than that with them certainly
Because I could not be humbugged with it
I did not care to be trying to govern people that would not be governed
I chucked it up  I wish I had never seen the place
There were three I think
There was one Hector Maclean
The old man died and his family removed of their own accord
That was the first change I think but there are a great many people who can speak to it
I lost sight of the family
Another man was Roderick Macdonald
He was removed for bad neighbouring
Then there was John Maclean a mason whom I employed for a long time in making roads and dykes and in fact supported him
There may have been another but the valuation roll will show
We did
He was never a tenant
He is in the position of being trustee over his sister
In fact the land is held for the heirs of Hugh and John Mackay
The tenant became insane and Mackinnon was appointed guardian for the good of the sister and he has remained and has been reaping the benefit of the land ever since
He may give the benefit or part of the benefit to the widow and children but so far as I know ho does not and in point of fact we never considered him a legal tenant he just represented another person
Of course I did for every payment he made
Certainly not so far as I remember
I dont think Mr Peter Mackinnon is a man likely to allow such a thing
I know that if he gave in those receipts for any purpose it must have been for some purpose of his own
There may have been an error but I know if he gave in a receipt it was not changed
Oh very
Very  I never had any question with them till March  We were on the very best of terms and I can speak very kindly of the people of Glendale
I never accused them but I may have put them on their guard against reading certain literature
I never did
I was
I think I was elected on two occasions
I think I attended the first
I dont think I attended the second much
I cannot say I was
I think there should be
I would approve of it
I always did approve of it and on the parochial board too and I had them on the parochial board
I had them in Sleat and in different places
There were several removals but very few
Yes
As a general rule it was by their own desire but not in every instance
The tenants at Lowergill were only six so far as I remember
So far as I remember the first move in that direction was that Roderick Gillies give up his lot and came to Skiniden and arranged to take a house and get a cows grass or two
Then Hugh Shaw had a young family and he wanted to remove and made some exchange with a namesake of his who left of his own accord to go abroad
Kenneth Mackinnon wanted to remove too because he had a young family but afterwards he came to the island of Pabbay where he still is and where he is much better off than he was at Lowergill
Neil Shaw who was here would have stopped had he got his share of it in fact he would have taken more
Donald Murcheson who is at Ramasaig is very much better off than at Lowergill
No I think not but he is much better off at Ramasaig than he was at Lowergill
Charles Mackinnon and his brother were in the same lot
Charles got a lot at Fasach and Sandy got a lot at Meiloveg
Charles did not make a good exchange to Fasach but in every other case they are much better off than they were
Never
Never so far as I  know
In some cases there might be
Yes taking the island all over I would say there are many cases
Give them more land with all my heart if it will do them good
Well I will not say that
They talk of fixity of tenure but except in exceptional cases they have had fixity of tenure
He would not like it
Ask him whether he would go to Lowergill
I do not think fixity of tenure would benefit them in every case but it would in some cases
I dont think fixity of tenure would benefit the people
It might in some cases but I certainly would put them upon such a footing that they could not be deprived of their lands according to the whim of a proprietor and certainly not of a factor
No I will answer questions
I would rather not
Well in answering any questions put to me I will try to give my opinion unbiassed but I would rather have questions put to me and I will answer them in a broad way
I should be rather afraid of that
I should be rather doubtful of it
It would be a very unhappy state of feeling if they were
Well if the crofters take up the no rent attitude as they have done in some parts and defy the proprietors rules and set the law of the country at defiance I certainly do not wonder at a proprietor making such a suggestion and expressing such a wish but I should be very sorry that such a state of matters should continue
No I think it is better not
Yes
I am a general merchant
I am also a member of the school board of Portree
I take a very deep interest in the crofter question
I and the other delegates for this village were appointed at a largely attended meeting of the inhabitants and at a subsequent meeting which was also largely attended we were intrusted to corroborate generally the evidence already laid before the Commission of the impoverished condition of the crofters in the isle of Skye
We were also asked to suggest to the Commission certain remedies which in the opinion of the meeting and in our own opinion would tend to improve the condition of the crofters and we were further asked to state certain local  grievances
From the nature of my business I have since the year  been in a position to know the circumstances of the people not only in the immediate neighbourhood of Portree but in several parishes throughout Skye and I know it to be a fact that cannot be gainsayed that the people are much worse off than they used to be not only this year which is an exceptional one but for several years back and instead of their circumstances improving they have been for a number of years as a rule getting poorer and poorer and it is beyond doubt that unless effective measures are taken without delay to remedy the state of matters a large number of the crofters must necessarily be paupers
An attempt is being made to show the Commission that the condition of the people is better than it was forty years ago
With that I entirely disagree
The statement will not bear examination for a moment
There is certainly more tea and sugar consumed but the scarcity of milk and other things accounts to a great extent for that
In the spring months for example there is more tea sold chiefly because milk is then scarcer
Take the parish of Kilmuir as an example
I myself remember well the time when the crofters there were well off comparatively they had more to eat and to drink they had more money they had more cattle and sheep to sell more wool to make clothing they were but little in debt but now it is quite the reverse
In my younger days crofters from the east side of that parish had only to state in almost any shop in Portree that they came from that district and goods would be given on credit with pleasure it being well known they were in good circumstances and that they were good payers
Now their credit with a few exceptions is entirely gone
The impoverished condition of the Isle of Skye is clearly attributable to the unequal division of the land or in other words to the fact that by far the largest and best part of the land is occupied by the few whilst the bulk of the people have only a small fraction of it and that almost without exception the worst part
It is computed that fourfifth parts of the land in Skye is occupied by thirty individuals whilst the remaining part of the population say  have only a fifth part
It is driving the people off the best and largest parts of the land and crowding them together on miserably small patches that has very nearly ruined the island and in my opinion and in the opinion of those who appointed me as a delegate the only effective remedy for relieving the distress which exists and which is increasing year after year is a more equitable division of the land
There is abundance of land in Skye for all the populationenough to give  acres taking hills and mountains into account to each family of five in the island striking out this village and some other small villages whose living does not depend upon land
It is not the scarcity of good land it is not the nature of the climate it is not the natural poverty of the soil it is not the failure of the herring fishing it is not even the failure of the potato crop that has brought an interesting a peaceful and a lawabiding people to the verge of pauperism
It is the large sheep farms and that cannot be too strongly emphasisedthat have done it
It stands to reason then that the chief remedy is the breaking up of the huge sheep farms and deer forests and giving the land to the crofter population in suitable lots
There is one sheep farm in Skye almost equal in extent to the whole estate of and many other very extensive farms on each of which there could be hundreds of families living comfortably
Again no division of the land will be satisfactory without fixity of tenure or in other words an absolute right for all time to come to the crofter occupants of the soil to the land which they occupy so long as they pay rent for it the rent to be fixed not by the proprietor but by valuators to be appointed by Government and this would not be robbing the proprietors of their rights or of their rents it would be only restoring to Highlanders the rights which anciently belonged to their forefathers
With fixity of tenure there ought to be also a provision to the effect that the improvements effected upon a croft should belong to the crofter himself and that it would not be in the power of the proprietor to raise the rents of a croft on account of improvements made upon it by the occupier
Say that I got an acre of land at a fixed rent of s an acre and that in course of time I improved it to such an extent as to bring the value up to s and that I was giving it up I ought to have the right of selling these improvements not to the proprietor but to my successor who would sit on this acre of ground at the original rent he having paid me one slump sum say eighteen years purchase for these improvements
Reverting to the subject of fixity of tenure I trace the present unsatisfactory state of matters to the want of it in the past
No proprietor of land let him be ever so goodhearted ought to have such absolute power over a multitude of crofter population as proprietors have had in the past
This power ought for ever to cease
Let a proprietor be ever so good what security is there that his successor will not be the reverse
I may state that my opinions are not communistic I have always been the reverse except upon the land question
I may state to the  Commission that my opinions have always been conservative upon other questions except the laud question
In Her Majestys dominions in India as your Lordship well knows the small tenants have fixity of tenure and rents at valuation and why should not Her Majestys subjects in the Highlands have the same
Another question that I notice the Commission asking is how in the event of the crofters getting increased holdings would they stock them and the reply generally has been we would expect Government to advance us money
I do not think Government would advance money on stock it would not be real security and Government I suppose would lend only on real security but I think Government might easily advance money on permanent improvements which would as nearly as possble be lending on landed security
Supposing then that a crofter with fixity of tenure by his own labour and that of his family effected permanent improvements on his land Government could lend on these improvements and the money so lent would help to stock his croft
Speaking on this subject the other day to a gentleman who was for a long time a crofter he said Oh give me so many acres of good land and I would take as much crops out of it in one year as would make me independentIn any case let the land be given back to the people at moderate rents with fixity of tenure and there will be no fear of their not stocking it
I might here be allowed to remark that the large sheep farms do not benefit the trade of the country the fiftieth part that the same quantity of land would do providing it were occupied by a crofting population in good circumstances
I do not think emigration a good solution of the question
Twothirds of the Skye people would have to emigrate before the other third would have enough of land according to the present division and surely it is not desirable on many grounds to send such a large number of people away from the island when there is land enough and to spare
If there were a surplus population emigration might then be thought of at present it is simply out of the question
Possibly the best possible settlement of the question would be a scheme to enable the occupants of the soil to purchase their holdings in the event of the proprietor being willing to sell and to make any such scheme workable transfer of land ought to be as simple and as cheap as bank or railway stock
I have been asked to state some grievances peculiar to the village
The want of grazing for cows and the want of ground for potatoes is felt very much by the village people as it is only very few that have either
The land surrounding Portree is practically in the hands of two individuals none of whom will give grazing to the village people let them stand ever so much in need of it
The consequence is that the milk supply for the village is exceedingly scarce and very dear and children and others suffer iu their health through the scarcity of milk
Even our excellent procurator fiscal has been refused grazing for his cow by Mr Stewart the new tacksman of Scorrybreck although he had it from Mr Stewarts predecessor
There is another matter which I was asked to state before the Commission though it is scarcely in connection with the crofter question viz that in this village parties anxious to build houses can only get leases for ninetynine years which are considered too short
Formerly I understand the proprietor had no power to give longer leases because the estate was entailed but now I understand it is perfectly in his power to give perpetual feus
It appears however that he is not willing to do so and I am asked to state to the Commission that it is felt to be a very great hardship that people who wish to build houses can only get ninetynine years leases
It is calculated to reduce the value of house property to a great extent in Portree and people dont want to build when they can only get short leases
There is one other remark I wish to make
It was stated here yesterday that it is impossible to get the same rents from crofters as from sheep farmers
I have simply to tell the Commissioners on the other hand that the large sheep farm of Raasay was let to Mr Mackenzie the first and the only tenant who had it for nineteen years at the very same rent which the crofters paid for it and when his lease was out he got it renewed at a very small advance upon the original rent so that practically the crofters were paying Mr Rainy as well as the large sheep farmer did
I am not able to state that
Possibly they were in arrears because in my early recollection it was shortly after the great destitution of  and very possibly they may have been in arrears then but I have no doubt whatever that if Mr Rainy had left the crofter population on the south part of Raasay and taken some interest in improving their circumstances there would not have been today  a penny of arrears on their crofts because that is the best part of the island
Not an inch
I cannot speak to former times
I have only been here since  and since then there has been no common ground except some lots in which some of the people got grazing for cows and a very few got potato ground
I rather think not and I may state that in my opinion it would have been better if Lord Macdonald or his factor had been approached first on the subject
I understand they have
No I never cut peats there
I think so
There is no charge made
To a few for instance Mr MLennan had the grazing of two cows from Mr Macleod
Most willingly
They would think it a great privilege to have the grazing of a cow
 or   I believe for good grazing
Summering
They would have to winter the cows of course
No I dont think Mr Macleod did
No it is just a parish with the usual authority in a parish
I am a native of Raasay
Yes to a certain extent
It would not meet all the case but it would meet it to a ertain extent
My meaning is this
Suppose I had a croft and four or five grownup sons who worked upon it for two or three years and improved it that is the value of my own and my familys labour and I would get my improvements certified and Government could easily lend money upon them then and I could have the money to pay for the cattle and sheep which I had got perhaps on credit when I got my croft
It would be so much wages earned by the family
Suppose I worked a whole winter on my croft and at the end of the winter or spring I got this money from Government for improvements it was for my own labour when I got it it was in my own possessionand it was in my power to do anything I liked with it
But I am labouring for myself
Yes but perhaps working for other people would not be so remunerative as working for my own croft
It would be available if I had it in my hand at the time if I had any other way of living when I was working
I might have some other means of keeping myself and my family without encroaching upon the money
That would not make it less money
It would be at my disposal to purchase stock with
It is quite clear to me
Suppose I had so much meal and other food during the whole year that I did not require to touch this money at all and if I was enabled at the end of that period to have this money clear without any demand upon it it would be at my disposal for the purchase of cattle and sheep
But I am supposing a case in which the family would not require that support during the time they were labouring
There are several ways of finding support
Yes there is a lot of spare time
It would encourage people to work
If they were not able to stock them at once they might stock them gradually
Though the crofts were not fully stocked they might be able to pay the rent
They might stock them by degrees
I suppose they would value the land according to what it was worth supposing it was stocked
People have very often to fight against these things
Rome was not built in a day
I did not mean that the proprietor should have at no time a right to revalue the crofts
Granted
No I would have crofts of different sizes according to the circumstances of those taking them
I do not think it would be a good plan to make every croft the same size
Surely
Yes
I have no objection to a portion being kept for large farms
I do think so
Yes
I would have no leases at all
I wuld have absolute security to the occupier of the soil
No I would not allow that
There would be no fear of getting successors
I believe there is an earth hunger in Skye just now the same as in Ireland
Do you mean in the same family
It would be far better he should not have power to distribute it among them especially a small croft
The world is wide they can work for themselves
I do not approve of that
Stern necessity would make them go then if they could not get a part of the croft
I would make it statute law so far as small crofts are concerned
Of course with a person renting a farm at  or  I would not make it the law in that case
I would leave that to family arrangement
Well I would leave it to wiser heads than my own
I would allow no subdivision except in very very rare casessuch as the case of a very old man who had only one son
In that case I would allow the son to live upon the croft till he was able to take it up in the course of nature
I have not thought upon that question
Yes
Perhaps they would get another croft
That is possible
As a rule population in the Highlands has not been increasing of late
Yes as a rule
I would think so most certainly
Yes
Yes
Yes
I should think so
What would be a fair rent at present on a yearly tenancy of the subjects let to each of the crofters of the three townships of Peinchorran Balmeanach and Gedentailer
I think the best way to convey the result of my examination will be to answer the questions as put in the memorandum of instructions reserving the few remarks till after I have answered the questions
See valuation attached to this paper
Three days
Very good
I never had an umbrella up except for about ten minutes one day
It is
I had been in it and crossed the island before
I had been getting sheep there
Yes I understand so
Yes
Yes
From  to  On the Balnagowan estate there are  crofts at from  to 
Yes
Yes
They did not do so a few years ago but I was able to induce them to do so and they did better
Yes
The men were telling me it was about to be sent in
There was no effort of any kind
Yes
Ten
I do not know
No
In the first place the first delegate who came in made a charge against me with regard to a horse
In the second place he complained that the soil was thin and poor  inches to  inches and in many parts  inches
I measured the soil in presence of the man who gave this account of the land and I got it from nine inches to three feet
The second delegate Mr John Bethune made a complaint against me in regard to two horses
In the first place I had permission to keep a horse and the horse had  particular work to do as there were no other horse in the town but itself
It had to convey or carry the wool from the town to the port and to carry the smearing material back to the township from the port and when a death occurred this horse was employed to convey the dead body to the grave
John Bethune complained of seeing this horse of mine on the ground
There were five crofts on Bernisdale that were put under wood
The summing of these crofts was ten cows and ten stirks
The people of the township were getting the profits of the grass of these ten cows and ten stirks with the exception of the consumption of my horse
Over and above I had to keep the road in repair on the west side of the country
I had to keep a van for the men who were engaged in repairing the road and two horses were required to convey it
It was for the road that it was used
The horse that I had a right to hold on the ground was not there at all
It was on another part of the ground for a part of the year working at the roads
It seems that the people of the township did not want my horse there for there were other three horses in the town but they were not mentioned to the Commissionersnone but mine
That is all I have to say
To tell the truth I scarcely remember
Yes such a thing occurred
The meeting was nearly over before I arrived
Yes I put in a word like the rest
The proprietor had nothing to do with it  I was acting for myself in that case
No
No
Yes
Yes
I told them they had not a full meeting there were only fifteen presentand that they had better adjourn till they had a fuller meeting
I did not know that they made delegates
If they did so they were appointed before I went in
The next night when the men were all assembled
Yes
Yes except one man
A gentleman from Inverness named Mr Mackenzie came down and I understand that he and the minister of the Free Church took a considerable part in the work
Mr Mackenzie gave an insight to the men and said he could appoint any delegate whom he chose and that they were at liberty to say anything they liked against proprietors ground officers and factors
Yes in one
They thought that this man would speak matter containing less substance and less sense than the others
Yes every one of them
No
Yes everything in it is right
They did not show it to me
That paper is from the people in the glen
They were present
They did so but this Bethune was elected by the minister and Mr Mackenzie
No their delegate was also in but they resent the testimony he gave
Draper and grocer
Yes in fishcuring
Yes in my absence I was
I believe that the poverty of the people has been caused principally by their small holdings by their being huddled together along the shore of what is considered the worst part of the land I believe that is the great cause of the poverty of the crofters along with bad seasons and the failure of the fishing
I honestly believe the principal cause is the smallness of their holdings
Yes
I have not been much in the west of Skye but I do business with people there and I have been listening to their complaints from time to time
Yes as far back as I remember
No I do not
Yes and I may say they have put me in mind of the Gaelic sayingbut the evidence since then has perhaps toned down the idea a good dealA bhist as m ag itheadh na beist as lugha s abhist as lugha adeanamh mar a dhfhaodasiwhich means The larger beast eating the smaller beast and the small beast doing what it can
Yes when there are fish to be caught
Yes
Yes
Yes
Not many some are of course
For a short season
The majority of them go to the east coast
I find them very honest when they have the means to pay but I find they are not able to pay regularly
Yes
Yes especially when there is not a good herring fishing I find there is great difficulty in getting my money from them
Last year and the year before that
Last year was worse than the year before and the year before that was still worse but the year  was a good year for fishing
I cured that year  barrels and last year only
Yes there were a good few caught in Loch Hourn
Yes their boats however are too small for going that distance
As a rule the boats are only suitable for the Sound of Skye
Yes
I think so there may be a little colouring in part of it
Yes
Yes with the exception of five years
I have been twenty years in business
Not much they are a little better
No
Yes
I cannot say so much for their food
I always thought their food was as substantial before as now
Well I dont see what they can buy except tea milk is scarcer than it was
Yes
Yes
I do not know it is much worse except on account of the severe gales of the last two yeare
As regards the fishing thirty years ago this used to be a famous place for fishing
I remember when a boy as many as  boats going out of the bay of Portree
The last good fishing was in the year I went to serve my time and ever since  it has been going gradually back till within the last five or six years when it has made a start again
Yes and since then I think the people have been rather improving for they have got better nets and boats than they had formerly
From the year  till six or seven years ago there were scarcely any nets worth speaking of but since then they have got better nets
If they had larger boats they could follow the herring fishing still farther off the island
They are quite prepared for the local fishing
Last year was not so good as the previous year
No I do not think they could
Whenever they find that there are herring on the coast they are at them
They are not lazy of that I can assure you
We have nothing of that now
Yes
Yes from September to the end of March
Well the lobsters are not to be got every year
Round by Uig Kilmaluag Rona Glendale and Waternish these are the places
There are no lobsters at the south end of the island or in the Sound here
They would be able to devote a certain portion of their time still to the fishing
Scarcely I am afraid the fishing here is necessary
I would give a man a little land even if he were a fisherman
It depends on the number of the family
There might be three or four brothers and two could manage the farm and two the fishing
I do not think it could interfere so much with the farm
I do not think they are fond of emigration
I have often asked them about it and they say that emigration has been tried and does not better those left behind a bit
Yes certainty it could if the land that belonged to those that went away were given to those who remained behind
Not so long as there are so many large farms in Skye I do not think they would like to leave their native land
I think so
Yes I daresay a good many of them are able but I believe they would have been abler some years ago than they are now
Yes I think there are some amongst them who could stock it
Yes a great many would require to be assisted
If they got a guarantee that they would not be removed out of these lands so long as they paid their rent I have no doubt that some people would come to their assistance and help them to stock their crofts
I mean both that the arrangement might remain for a certain number of years
No there have not been so many removals as raising of rent
Yes
Yes
Yes
And because they could not get crofts
Yes
Yes
It has
Yes
No
No
No
It must have been lately
Yes that is my opinion
There are benevolent strangers in the country that have been advancing money to a large extent already
Well along with the proprietors they might continue to help the people
Not to any very considerable extent I would not wish the large farms to be all broken down
I dont think the capital required would be very great along with what they have to stock a   or  croft
Yes
Yes but they are not absolutely free of stock
They have less or more cattle on the ground and if these were allowed to multiply the landlord need not be exacting the rent
I would have the landlord do what I often dotake something to account
In the case of a fisherman or crofter when he cannot pay his bill for meal amounting perhaps to  to  or even  I have taken as little as   or   to account and let him go on
He might but he would byandbye get out of it
s a boll
Yes
It depends on where he took it from
I just write for meal I do not keep a store of meal
Very little
With a very small profit
It depends entirely on what he paid for it
Yes
I have two classesat s d and s
Fourpence per lb and moist sugar at threepence
Yes I consider it high but it depends on where it is sold and what it takes to carry it to the place
Railroad making
Yes they are good at almost anything except improving their crofts
I think there were some
Yes
I think it would
Between  and
Yes pretty well
Yes
Yes
Yes with a guarantea that the rents would not be increased and that they would not be removed so long as they paid their rent
Yes I would
I have already helped them to pay their rents without charging them any interest by signing bills for them
That is all
Yes
Yes many of them do
Yes
A very strong feeling
Yes
I would require about 
Yes
Yes
I am factor for my son and for the Glendale trustees
Well I have taken some notes
At the meeting at Skeabost there was a case mentioned by John Bethune who stated that when I was factor at Skeabost a man was fined  s for the keep of a horse
I want to explain that I was not factor for the late Mr Macleod of Grishornish at that time but I occasionally gave him assistance
I am not aware of any case of the kind
I believe there was a case where a man was charged  a year for the grazing of a horse and that is the only case I am aware of
I would like to refer to the matter of Edinbane and what happened at DunveganMurdo MLean made several complaints as to my management of the Grishornish property to which I wish to reply
I may preface it by stating that I have had charge of the property for fourteen years
During that time I have not increased the rental of this township
I have not evicted a single tenant
I have not encroached upon the hill grazings nor taken an inch of their arable lands from them
MLean states that I increased the rent of one crofter for taking a lodger who he admitted was a hawker
He should have added that it was for harbouring tinkers and becoming a nuisance to the neighbours that the rent was raised
He next charged me with increasing the rent of another crofter s for quarrelling with his neighbour
He should have said fighting with his neighbour and being otherwise troublesome to the crofters adjoining his land
Both crofters in  had this increase taken off and the rents made the same as before
The crofter who had his rent slightly increased for selling part of his crop ofF the property knew that by the rules of the estate he could sell it to any of the crofters or to any one on the property and he had no excuse for refusing to comply with the rules
This crofter and four others had been paying less rent than the other eighteen crofters who had half lots and as they had about the same quantity of arable land and were allowed the same summing of cattle and received an equal share of the sheep profits I considered they were bound to pay the same rent and as two or three of the crofters had been complaining of paying more than the others I reduced them and made all as nearly as possible alike
These changes reduced the rental of the township    s as will be seen by comparing the valuation roll of  with that of  I may here state that the late Mr Macleod of Grishornish about twenty years ago assisted six families to emigrate from the township purchasing lands for them in America
He then removed the crofters of Kerrol taking the vacant lands of Kerrol and Bendhu into his own hands
He expended a large amount of money in draining and trenching parts of these lands and put up houses for the cottars of Bendhu
The rest of the lands he had under cultivation and I may also mention that he erected on these lands the Gesto Hospital and left it handsomely endowed for the benefit of the people of Skye and Murdo MLeans brother lately received some of its benefits
This was the state of matters when I received charge of the property for my son who is a minor and as I have said I have made no change on the croftersholdings since
The houses were built by the crofters and I have not interfered with them nor have I interfered with the cropping of the land but I have interested myself in the management of the stock of sheep
I purchased shares of these sheep and I gave shares to those who had none or who had not a full share so as to make all equal in holding half or whole shares I assisted at sales of their sheep and lambs not even charging outlays and the result is that for fourteen years the average profit has been  per share
A complaint has been made relative to the bank interest
The payments for sheep and lambs are as often made after the term as before it as you will see by the past years account which I now produce
Besides the bank only allows  or  per cent on current account and though all the money was paid in two months before theaccount closed the interest would not amount to more than s
This year the difference is on my side
MLean states also that only  or  lambs are usually sold
That is not correct
As you wLU see from the paper  lambs were sold last year and seldom under  Horses are not included in the summing and no rent for them is paid
The charge of s for each is divided amongst the crofters
I do not interfere in the sale of their cattle and though I frequently ask them to give me the first offer of any animal they have for sale it makes no difference whether they do so or rot
I can buy from strangers as a rule on better terms
My keeping a meal store also appears to be a grievance but as I expend in labour  or  annuaHy I require a store to supply my engaged servants and other workers with their ordinary allowance of meal The store is open to any of the tenants who may want a supply but I never asked any one of them to take meal from the store and I have often cautioned my manager not to give them so much
Our prices for the past two years have been s or s per boll cash and s credit except for four months last July August September and Octoberwhen it was d per boll more owing to the prices in the south being higher
Another delegate from Edinbane says that the crofters there had only four boats
I find however they have fourteen good seagoing boats
I think I have shown that the complaints made are groundless and are not correct
I may just state that Murdo MLean and his brother have got upwards of  from me for draining during the last three or four years
These are my statements in reply to the complaints made and I exhibit a letter from the banker showing the rate of interest
For a much longer period but that is during my time
None as a whole there have been a few shillings put on to equalise lower rents
No
They have been successful
So I understand
Rev
Mr Darrock
I have only to say that I happened to be in Canada at the time and I saw the parties
They landed there stopping on farms purchased for them by Mr Macleod of Grishornish and most of them remained there in my time but some of them were going further west and getting land for themselves
They settled there on lands provided for them by Mr Macleod until such time as I understood they could purchase laud for themselves and they seemed to be very much pleased indeed with the country
No never
No unless you have any questions to put to me in reference to it
Yes
There is no interest in the account except against some advances for wool
No part of the money for the sheep was paid to me till th March so that the account is rather in my favour than against me
Yes
Quite so
There was none except against taking oysters
I have a lease of the beds of oysters and mussels and they make a handle of that
I dont forbid them but I have a lease for the two
Anybody
I do not interfere with them if they do not touch the oysters
I pay a rent of   to the Board of Trade
Yes
Yes they are increasing
They were taking them all away at that time
I believe they would
They are increasing slowly and last year was very much better than previous years
I have not offered any for sale yet
I intended to send some to the Exhibition but I was rather late in doing it
Yes an oyster shore ought to be very valuable
Free to the people
A great number
There are a great number of oyster banks about Skye
I do not think they are very profitable now
They have been cleaned off very much
I do not remember
I have two shares on the hill but they belong to that part of the Edinbane township called Kerrol
They have the same right to these two shares that the rest of the town has
There has been no change made by me
No change whatever
I stand in the same position as any one of them
I pay the same share of the expenses and I hold the arable land of Kerrol in my own hands
Twentynine
I have two
No the grazing of Kerrol is enclosed
The late Mr Macleod made a sort of model farm and he kept part of it in grass and cultivation and had part of it planted
I just keep it in the same way
That is the portion they think they should have the run of
About twenty years ago but they were removed from the lands of Kerrol to Edinbane when he sent the six away to America and they got lands that became vacant there instead
exactly two crofts
It is exclusively the proprietors
I am acting for my son
I dont think so
I was not aware of it till I heard of it at Dunvegan
Never
Each share pays   rent and receives the same advantages in the hill grazing as the other croft that pays  rent
That is nonsense
The election was over before anything of the kind happened and I had no inducement to do so
It was to equalise them and as you will observe from the paper the changes reduced the rent  s and did not as a whole increase it
They were all deriving the same amount of profit from the different lots
They had all the same arable land and received the same summing of cattle
I took it off some and put it on to others
Yes
Quite incorrect
It is quite possible I may have chaffed him because at that time there was a little excitement about the election
Over all the ground
No the lands of Kerrol are fenced off
That must have given rise to it
I have no other statement to make unless I am asked in reference to Glendale
I have had very little to do with it
There is not very much that I have got to say
I am not aware
I am not prepared at present
Yes I have selected these townships specially on that account but I believe it applies to the whole estate because there were deductions given where there were changes of boundary in proportion to the old rents
But I have selected these so far as my knowledge goes as being townships in which there was no change whatever
Then we come to the larger farms on the Macdonald estate COMPARATIVE STATEMENT of RENTS of larger Tenants on the Macdonald  Estates in  and 
 The amount the sheriff found him liable in was  s d and I struck off  I credited him in the value of his house  and that left about  I believe it was about   that I got
The rest was paid to sheriff officers and the remainder was credited to the incoming tenant
Neither the proprietor nor I pocketed it
The man was got out in December and the incoming teuant was claiming damages for not getting possession at Whitsunday and he got that money as he was entitled to it
He had been keeping his stock at expense elsewhere and he was entitled to the money
Yes
No it was not he who valued in  it was Mr Munro
Yes
Yes
The first was in  and I think the second was in
I act for Lord Macdonald MLeod of MLeod Major Fraser of Kilmuir Mr Macdonald of   Skeabost Mr Macalister of Strathaird
On the estate of Kilmuir of course the rents have been raised on the others I may say they are similar
I dont think it nothing essential
Yes
I believe that before then the prices of cattle were higher
Of cattle in fact I know it was so
Yes that was the rise made by Macdonald Tormore which has been so much spoken of
I have no doubt that Mr Macdonald Tormore thought that when other proprietors throughout the country were getting very much larger rises surely Lord Macdonald was entitled to  or  per cent
He was a good practical judge of land too and believed the lands to be worth it
I think so
Very considerable on account of bad farming
Probably that cause effects it too but I understand that in other parts of the country where the crofts are fully as small a system of rotation of cropping regularly goes onin other parts of the north
Yes from excessive cropping
Yes
Yes
I leave that to the Commission
I can see my way to no other
I do not think it was inconsiderate because the tenants could not at the time stock it
They were poor and when sheep became valuable they were not able to compete with other persons who wanted the land and on that account the tenants were not able to take up the pasture lands and to stock them
I think a better rent than the small tenants could give for it was to be obtained from the large tenants and that consequently the small tenants lost it
I think that is the real reason and they could not stock it at that time
No
They were very poor at that time generally the small tenants throughout Skye
I may say I am only talking from hearsaywhat I have read and what I have heard from others
Of course I have no personal knowledge of this but what I have stated is what I have been told
I believe it could not be done without sacrifice to the proprietor
I believe that thoroughly
At the same time I know that many proprietors in Skye are ready to make a sacrifice
I believe so that they will be restoredthe only coudition being that the tenants can show that they are able to stock it
It is but it is for individual proprietors to determine whether they are going to make a loss or not
I know some proprietors would be ready to make the loss because they can afford it
I know that other proprietors cannot afford it and would not be so ready though equally benevolent
Yes I would like to do it
I believe it would be quite possible
I am rather doubtful of that in many cases
I know the experiment was tried before on the Macdonald estates
Leases were granted containing these stipulations about improvement about fifty years ago and some of the leases are now lying in my office but I am aware the stipulations were never carried out
However there has been such an advance in public opinion and intelligence on the part of the tenants that I think it ought now to be tried again and though it did not succeed before I think it might succeed now and it ought to be tried
Well there has not been much arable ground taken from them
I do not think they complain of that
It is the hill pasture they complain of  and I would certainly wish to see in some cases where the proprietor consents to it and could do it I would like personally to see the tenants getting the hill pasture and entering on leases with these stipulations
I would allow them to break up as much as might be fixed by the lease and I think it ought to be extended as it certainly might be in many parts of Skye so as to give more room
I have only seen two or three evictions forcibly carried out by the officers of the law for the last twenty years so far as I can remember and these were for misbehaviour and the parties becoming a nuisance to their neighbours and being complained of
Well I have seen the tenants of Glen Uig voluntarily going at the request of the proprietor but they were not turned out by officers nor was any force used
I have seen them removed to other parts of the estate but except these I am not aware I have seen any
Well I have no doubt they did but they agreed to go and they went quietly
I have not the least doubt they were unwilling to go but they agreed to go and they went
I dont think they were placed upon new lands
I was not the factor then but my recollection is that some of them got vacant lots on other parts of the estate
My recollection isand I dont think I am wrongthat there was an emigration at that time and that there were some vacant lots
I know that in other cases lots were subdivided
I believe they were but I dont remember very accurately about it though I know very generally that there were not any new lands placed under crofters at that time
I have known a few but it is very difficult because the tenants press us so much that we sometimes yield and just allow them to have them as they were before
We wish as a general rule estates to increase the holdings and to add a vacant lot to the next lot if possible but we found great difficulty about doing so
No I dont think so
No I dont think so
Yes I would allow increase but not lessening
I think that would be an excellent thing but I am so much impressed with the difficulty of preventing subdivision that I should like to see a very strict enactment on the subject
It would no doubt lead to harshness but really no man unless he is a man of iron altogether can prevent subdivision among Highland crofters
Certainly not
I should be the last to see my fellowcountrymen illused in any way
I should like to see their condition improved and retained
Personally I do wish that
I think so
I think so
I know that those who are better off in the country such a class of Skyemen as I belong to myself always go abroad and they generally succeed abroad and I do not see why the crofters who are much poorer do not try the same thing on a much larger scale than they do at present
I think it is to a great extent natural
I think that the natural desire to remain in Skye has been increased by agitators and others but I know it is very natural to the people of Skye to wish to remain in Skye and not to emigrate
Well when the harvest is reaped they will be going
They are in working order
They actually do grind corn but of course the past season was a bad one and there was little ground
They are really bona fide going mills as bona fide as any other mills
I believe so to a great extent and partly owing to the bad seasons when there was less corn actually to grind or in existence for any purpose
Your Lordship was perfectly right in saying that the tenants fnd it pays better to give the sheaves just as they stand to the cattle and to buy meal rather than to grind the corn
He generally has a croft
Yes as a rule
From  to  sometimes
No including the croft
It is extremely small
In some cases I think the croft is worth the rent and in other cases I think the mill rent alone may be about  but there are millers present here who can tell
It depends on the lie of the ground
In particular cases but they both complain
It depends entirely on circumstances
I know that in some cases the crofters have positively objected to put up a fence and would not allow it
In other cases I know the crofters and tacksmen are both anxious for a fence
I can specify instances of both sides of the matter
I do not remember at present of having done so but there is one on Major Frasers estate that is about to go on and there are various others in contemplation to which I as factor am distinctly favourable as I think there ought always to be a fence between crofterslands and tacksmens lands
A wire fence
I think it would be a distinct advantage and would prevent a great deal of bad feeling or trouble
I think if there was any such right it should be a mutual right
Yes I think that might do good
I erected a fence last year round the Sconser arable lands which I certainly understood was quite sufficient to keep out the deer and I understood the tenants themselves were of that opinion too
There has been a fence actually erected round there and I am now in the course of erecting a fence to keep out the deer round the township of Torrin in Strath who also complain of the deer visiting them occasionally
I believe it is
I never heard it was not but if we find it is not sufficient we must improve it because we really do wish honestly and efficiently that those tenants should not be troubled by deer at Sconser
There has been a forest there from time immemorial
No that was the time I got the tenants names in the books
I think these three townships were removed on account of the forest later than that but I do not know the exact time
Not much later perhaps up to
Yes it was never fenced
Not very frequent an occasional complaint
I know that Lord Macdonald has been very anxious for a long time that the tenants should not be disturbed by the deer and that he occasionally gave sums voluntarily to people on the estate who complained of trespass
Yes that is to say the tenants of Colliemore and Torrin who are the tenants most exposed
That would be an enormous expense and I do not know that the advantages would compensate for it because deer fences are very expensive indeed
Very often when we let our lands to English sportsmen they come down and they say all sorts of things which we dont sanction or approve of but which we cannot prevent them saying but we proprietors do not wish or authorise any such statements to be made to our tenants and they are very seldom made and the tenants have other advantages which far more than counterbalance a few words said occasionally on the hillside
The deer sometimes come upon the hill pasture of the tenants themselves and the sportsmen have the right to follow them there as well as on the forest
I know that they generally do it
As to the legal right of the matter I am not quite certain but I never heard any question or difficulty arising from that
Yes
Well I have had experience of evils arising from the one thing but I have had no experience of evils arising from the other so I am not prepared to give a distinct answer upou the point but my impression is rather that the expense of deer fences would be so enormous for all the advantage to be gained that it might scarcely be worth while
However I have had no complaints arising from deer trespassing except upou arable ground and I think that ought to be fenced against deer
He said we were indifferent
I said I was sorry the minister was of that opinion
I know exactly what I said
The minister and I are very good friends and I dont think that anything he has said will interfere with our friendship in the least though I was a little annoyed with it at the time
Yes
I believe there are a great many poor crofters but I think the majority of them are quite solvent
I cannot answer that
I am a banker and I consider my lips closed on that point
Unless I am ordered and compelled to give information I must respectfully decline to do so on the score of duty
I think they are a great deal better fed and better clothed than they were in my earliest recollection
That is my opinion
They used to feed on potatoes and now they feed mostly on oatmeal and I have heard many say that the people look much healthier and stronger now than they used to do
I have heard that frequently remarked
I believe that among the crofters there are a number of people in debt the same as there are amongst any other class in the United Kingdom
I dont see any increase in the number of prosecutions before the Sheriff Court or anything of that sort
In fact I think the prosecutions are decreasing
I believe at the same time there are a great many crofters in debt to the merchants but there are a great many who are not and who are quite able to stand their grouud like men if put to it
If the whole of Skye is taken I dont think so
I daresay the last bad year or two might have had some effect in making people sell animals which they would not otherwise have sold but otherwise I would rather say that the stocks of crofters are increasing or why are they wanting more land
In fact in my experience the desire for more land has generally arisen out of increasing stocksnot always but very often
That they were not offered to competition and that we did not wish the crofters to be set one against the other to raise the value of the lands as big farmers are doing
Yes on the principle that we wish them to be in good circumstances and that we thought it was a good thing
I think no crofters can pay the same rent which large farmers pay in fact I am perfectly positive that no crofters can succeed if they pay the tacksmens rents
It will ruin them
I am speaking not from theory but from what I have seen and know and I believe they cannot pay
I dont believe that a body of them paying  each of rent could afford to pay the same rent that the proprietors get from tacksmen
I have never seen a tenant in my life who would confess that his rent was low
I have never met him yet
Even in cases where I have known tenants to make large fortunes they complain of their rents and I have all my life heard tenants complaining of their rents and that is what I chiefly refer to
All classes of agriculturists complain of that
Yes and I have heard the crofters say that they wished they had more ground in some cases
But the other was the real substantial complaint
I never heard much of that stated
In fact I never heard so much of it stated as I have heard since the Commission sat though I have heard of holdings being reduced by subdivision
I never heard so much of tenants being put in as I have heard within the last fortnight
I have been a factor myself since  and I think I can remember about ten years before that but I was not regularly in my fathers office during all that time
Yes I remember it distinctly as a boy
No I think it was from other parts
I really cannot tell but I remember the people being here and going away that is all
No though I remember seeing the people in Portree
I think Mr Rainy forced his tenants away but I am not quite sure
On the Macleod estate there were very few forced evictions
Yes but I think it is largely due to the action of agitators
Yes
I think it was about three years ago
I am not aware
I really do not remember
I never thought of a Royal Commission
I dont remember anything about it but I may have thought that the proprietors themselves ought to inquire
Yes
Yes I do
My experience has been that they are above me
I am not factor for Glendale Waternish Raasay Lyndale Grishornish Orbost Edinbane and Husabost
I hold a number of offices
I am a bank agent and solicitor and I was elected clerk of the Portree school board
I am also distributor of stamps and collector of taxes
I think that is all in Portree so far as I remember
I am captain of volunteers and I hold a number of minor offices
I have been freely elected a member of the Stenscholl school board the Kilmuir school board the Duirinish school board the Strath school board and the Bracadale school board
Yes I am clerk and treasurer but I get no pay
I get pay where I am not a member of the board
I am paid in Snizort and I am paid in Portree and the parish of Bracadale gives me a small sum for my outlays but nothing for my trouble
In the other parishes I discharge the duties without fee or reward and they are very troublesome and very responsible
No I am not clerk
I am collector
I was elected by the road trustees as collector
Yes I get  a year for that
I have six or seven clerks
Well I am at my work generally from tea in the morning till one next morning and sometimes two
I think I have worked as hard as any working man in the north of Scotland
I work very hard
As I have explained those thousands are above me but I dont think the tenants themselves have complained very much of me on the whole and my constituents so far as I know are satisfied with my endeavours
I daresay if I were asked I am not a bit more pleased than the croftars are
Yes and I am very proud of my tenants and very much obliged to them
Yes they are very nice people and I should like to see them have more land
Yes I am quite of opinion that they should have more ground and I should be very glad to see them have Glasnakill if they could stock it
I wrote to him twice and he is sometimes very stiff about answering letters
I dont think he has ever said no but he has never said yes
Yes
I dont think anybody ever heard me say that
I dont know that I should be asked that in my official capacity
Well at the time Major Fraser resolved on having the property revalued by Mr Malcolm I had some doubt about whether it was expedient or not and I think I mentioned that to Major Fraser
Then I had the matter fully explained to methat is to say about the system of valuation and I actually saw the basis of valuation
The basis was the old summingLord Macdonalds old summing before Major Fraser bought the estate
Mr Malcolm explained to me and showed me figures and so did Major Fraser to the effect that every cow on the estate on an average was valued at about s or s the lowest being s and the highest s but that s was only on a few of the best in the township and I should say that the average was s or s
Every sheep was valued at s and every horse at  The arable was valued at from s to s per acre in some few cases
I think it was s but the average would be s
These were all added together and that made the rent and nothing but that
When that was explained to me I thought it was not at all dear and that there was nothing excessive in itin fact that there were other rents in Skye quite as high and that it was a fair rent so any doubts I had about the matter were removed
There was a further test viz that the tenants were offered if they were dissatisfied that Major Fraser would make any one of them who thought it was too high a present of two years of the increased rent if he wished to remove
Whatever doubt I had before was removed when I saw all this and I thought that the rents were not excessive
Of course it was but it was the best land in Skye
I would be very glad to mention the sum but I dont remember
I really would prefer to be accurate and to hand in a slip about it
I know that this year there has been a very large expenditure thereseveral hundred pounds
Some crofters said there was scarcely anything spent at all
Every year there is a very considerable  xpenditure on the estate
I should like to have a little time to consider that question because I cannot answer it all at once
I know he did a good deal in the way of watercourses and bridges and so on and as I mentioned he took a very large interest in the Skye railway which was for the benefit of his tenants
It was entirely for that that he took it and not for profit
No
That was the rule of the estate and I think it is a very excellent rule in dealing with croftersnot to be rigidly adhered to but an excellent rule for the sake of the crofters themselves because if some of them are allowed they will fall into arrear and have ultimately to be evicted and I have found that the best thing for the tenants if they are at all able is to make them pay the rent every year as it goes
Before I became factor it was a rule and I think it is a very excellent rule and it is one that I would always follow although not rigidly
I dont know but I dont think so because I see Mr Coll Macdonald says that the administration of the Macdonald estates has been extremely mild and the utmost kindliness shown to the tenants though we have not heard anything of it from the tenants during the sitting of this Commission or almost anything
I was hearing it
I have always heard there were bill discounters in the country but the same thing occursperhaps not so much upon all estates whether they have to pay the years rent or not though not to the same extent
Yes but I have frequently heard the people who signed the bills deny that they ever got a farthing
As a general rule they said they did not and the crofters said they did
They get excellent prices for them
I dont think so
They are the average prices of cattle and the cattle held in those days were very inferior and much lower in value as compared with the class of cattle now held generally by crofters especially on the estate of Kilmuir where the crofterscattle are particularly good
I knew him well
No
I think he had the farm of Toteashaig a small farm
He was a man respected in the parish in his own day and he was highly respected by the crofters
I did not read that I was only looking to the rate of wages and I only referred to him incidentally
I myself remember a shilling a day being given
Well I did not read that
Well when a man falls into arrear he is sometimes warned to remove and sometimes not
In fact the tenants expect warning themselves if they do not pay because they know that the condition of their holding the land is that they pay the rent
No I did not
A certain gentleman told me that he was going to challenge me before the Commission about the amount of money I made off removals on the different estates with which I was connected in Skye during a period of years
I accordingly took the trouble to look up the old removings which had taken place for the last ten years on the Kilmuir estate and I find that the average of the whole ten years did not come to  a year and you know that represents a very small amount of removals
s or s
A good deal depends on the distances but I know that what was charged did not pay the expenses and I like other agents always lost a good deal of money by it
The people came and made a story and one generally was a little softened by it and would let them off
There are only two at present and I dont think I make what would keep me in tea by law
I have always discouraged law and so did my father before me
I have not the slightest objection to another agent coming here and if he makes enough to keep him in tea I will be very much surprised
I dont think so not for a very long time
The law business here is really nilnext to nothing
I make a very small sum by it altogether
Very much indeed
I think it is by the discouragement which the agents here Mr MLennan and myself give to poor people
They are apt to be litigious which we discourage very much
It is competent in one way but they are generally remitted back
Yes
For sheriff court casessmall cases
I am very strongly of that opinionvery strongly indeed
I dont think it is safe to judge such matters by arithmetical calculation
I know as a positive fact that crofters cannot pay it and no amount of arithmetical calculation will make me change my  opinion
I believe my opinion will be supported by all who know anything about the matter
I know that tacksmen always complain and put some value on the trouble and bother they have
Well I have mentioned the causes which have led to the people being removed and evicted and perhaps that may be one of them but I know that in my time it has never been done from that cause
We rather protect the crofters than otherwise
Yes but if they were crofters I would be doubtful whether it was true
There is no doubt that the great rise in the value of sheep has probably been the real cause of many evictions
Yes that is one way of putting it but another and a practical way of putting it is that the crofters could not pay the rent that the tacksmen pay
The one is the practical and the other the sentimental way of putting it
So far as sentiment goes I am a Highlander myself as much as any man and I entertain a good deal of all these sentiments like my neighbours and I dont like these things more than anybody else
Well I dont think I would
I am just as sentimental and strong on the Highland question as any body else though I happen to be a factor and
I am as fond of my countrymen and country as anybody else
I know I can get as much milk myself as I like and for all that I take a great deal more tea than milk
I know people prefer tea to milk
Well I have no doubt there is in the country sometimes a scarcity of milk for children as there is in towns and everywhere else
I have no doubt that the crofterscows sometimes dont have calves
Tacksmens cows also very often dont have calves
Decidedly it is a great misfortune to a poor man for his cow not to have a calf
I think about  or
I dont think so
They show the lots
Yes they show arable pasture and so forth
It would entail a very large amount of labour but if the Commission would wish me to do it I will be very glad to do what I can
No
I could not do that because the hill pasture has been so far interfered with
I could do it in some cases
I dont know that the plans would show it sufficiently to enable me to give it correctly but they show the arable ground quite easily
I dont think the maps will show that but I will be glad to do anything I can to further the objects of the Commission
Oh no
Perfectly positive
It is a very easy thing to say although you cannot tell the exact number of acres
I cannot tell the exact number of inches between me and the wall but I know it is not a thousand yards and though I cannot tell the exact number of acres which the crofters have and the tacksmen have I know as matter of fact that the one is much more highly rented than the other
If the crofters could pay the same rent as the large tacksmen why should they not get the ground
They cant
They think they could pay but they are entirely mistaken
It is nonsense
They would go to ruin in a few years if they paid the tacksmens rents
I dont state that for any object but as a fact
I suppose about  or  acres
From  to  I should not like to make any mistake upon that point because the figures are capable of being accurately stated
I may be entirely wrong
But is it of any advantage
But if you follow it out upon a wrong basis where are you
I dont believe the value in Skye is s per acre but I dont know
I am not prepared for those questions
That is not to Macleod
Well we have nothing to do with that
I cannot tell what these tacksmens subtenants are paying
I said that I personally think it would be for the advantage of the crofters that the tenant should hold direct from the landlord
Distinctly
We are this year giving a large slice and I dont think it was mentioned before the Commission indeed very few things except hardships were mentionedwe are giving a large slice of the fine green laud of Ulinish to the crofters in Struan on the Macleod estate
Perhaps it was mentioned but I did not observe it
It is fine land
I believe they are just the old dues that had been handed down for a very long time
I never heard complaints about them
I believe so
They are barony lands and we have had possession from time immemorial
It is not specially mentioned in tho rental
I fancy there is Is or s or s included in the rent but it is not mentioned in the rental and has not been for a long time
I mean this that public opinion has changed very much upon that point and that people in former times did not consider it a very serious matter to remove some tenants but now no proprietor would evict a body of tenants or even one tenant
Not entirely because the proprietorsown sentiments and feelings on the subject have probably changed just as much as the sentiments of the public
I dont know
I am a proprietor myself and I know what I have said
For three or four years and annoyance besides
I know Dr Martin was subjected to that and I know Dr Martin to be a very kind man
I believe that Dr Martin would not remove a single tenant on his estate though he said that
I believe he would be as reluctant as any one to remove any tenant on his estate if the rent were paid
I believe that Lord Macdonald or Macleod would not remove their small tenants for the value of their estates and I dont believe that Dr Martin would either though he was led into saying that
I said the man was indebted to his imagination for that statement
I dont believe a single word of it
I do know that but I know more than that namely that another gentleman was to provide the money for taking it and not himself so far as I know about it
He was not gamekeeper for Lord Macdonald but was gamekeeper for Mr Wolstenholme the tenant and I think he was gamekeeper for ten or twelve years
I have nothing to say except that
I dont believe he made that
I dont know but I dont believe he made that
Yes but I understood he was supported by another gentleman
Well I took him to be an honest man and that he would not deceive me
Dr Martin is now a very old man and does not do much
Dr Fraser Edinbane gives advice and Dr MLean is a most skilful man
I dont know that I should mention any private matter but I believe she is not satisfied with Dr Campbell being the parochial doctor
Most distinctly
I know of no one of whom that may be said with more truth
She does in many ways in their kindness and goodness to the tenants
I concur in it
The value of the sheep lands in Skye has fallen a good deal in my time
It is a very serious matter but I should mention that this year I had the farms of Suishnish and Borroraig the rental of which is  advertised for nearly a year with the view of trying how small tenants would do upon them tenants of about  who I thought would be a good class of tenants to have
I advertised asking offers saying that I would divide it amongst six tenants if I could get suitable offerers
Not a single tenant of that class ever came near me at all
Well the present rent is  but I would be quite prepared to recommend its being lowered to about 
Yes
I was anxious that that should be tried and I wrote to tenants who I thought would take it but they did not seem to see the advantage of it at all
That was a thing to be arranged with the tenants
I would give fifteen years at once if the people could stock it
I was prepared to recommend that to Lord Macdonald if we got six tenants but not a single creature came forward
I wrote out circulars about it and advertised it on the inn at Broadford and all through the property and there were not six to come forward though we had been hearing of this cry
A few
I should like very much to see that
We have tried Ben Lee and we shall see how the Braes crofters get on there
Well I should like very much to see people rising and improving in their condition but I dont think they will do it by agitation but by hard work and labour
I heard one tenant at Bracadale saying he had paid plenty rent and that it was time for him to take it easy
Well some who began in a very small way are now in a very large way
I think Mr Macleod Monkstadt is a man who has shown crofters and others what they could do if they put their shoulders to the wheel and were clever and active
He is a very clever man too
Yes
There is Mr Macdonald Skerrinish who has made a good deal of money and I believe many tacksmen have made a good deal of money
Yes
Of course those who came from the Lowlands are not descendants of Highland people
I dont remember any lowlander because we generally hold our own with them here and they stay for a while and then they go
Generally speaking I think I know that several have gone because they were nonresident and we prefer local men to nonresident Lowlanders
Distinctly
We are discouraging nonresident local tenants which may account for their not being able to hold their own here
Yes
Well there are so many different characters amongst the crofters that it might be injudicious to grant a lease to every crofter
There are some men who are known to be extremely litigious and others extremely troublesome to their neighbours so that to grant leases indiscriminately would be very much objected to and found impracticable and bad in working amongst the crofters themselves
Yes but I believe every proprietor in Skye would at once grant leases to crofters
I have myself frequently offered leases to crofters but they seemed to be quite secure of their places in Skye and not to care much about them
I think so
I have and there are a great many crofters men of most excellent character to whom no proprietor need have the slightest hesitation in granting leases and there are only a few to whom I think it would not be judicious to grant leases
They never took any notice of it
I think the crofters of Skye understand agriculture very badly and they dont see the advantage of it
I am told that in Ayrshire it is carried out in crofts of two or three acres and I dont see why with a moderate amount of fencing it should not be carried out in Skye
Crofts of three or four acres could easily be made into shifts
They have been given land at a considerable loss to the proprietor Macleod of Macleod and from the disposition which Macleod entertains towards his tenants I believe that more will follow of the same kind
I think the proprietor would lose considerably by anything of that sortby giving the tack land to crofters but as I said before I believe that most proprietors are quite willing from regard to the people to make certain losses
Most distinctly
Everybody knows that who knows anything about sheepfarming
Perhaps that could be done but really I dont know
That has not come under my notice but I think it is a very good thing
Well it is possible but I have not considered the subject in that light
It is a new light to me on the subject entirely
Yes most decidedly
Yes the expense of such a fence would be enormous
Yes
Distinctly
No everybody wishes to get payment of his debts as well as proprietors do
I do not think so nothing like it because the arable is a very small proportion of the gains of the crofter
Distinctly and also the change in the value of money and all the other circumstances connected with them
On most estates in Skye rents have not been raised for the last sixty or seventy years
Major Fraser voluntarily granted a reduction of  per cent to the miller on his estate
I dont know of any other case
Yes if we had a few good years it would change the views of the crofters immensely
I must admit that the land will not yield on account of bad agriculture so much as it used to yield but they could send a great deal more than they can send now on account of the bad seasons
I should say that the small tenants have lost in Skye for the last two or three years not entirely by the deficient yield of the land but also probably to fully as great an extent by their crops being swept off the ground by dreadful storms after the corn had been cut
For two or three years the crop was swept into the sea in a great many places
I know that as a positive fact and the crofters themselves will say so
Most certainly
The potato is well known to deteriorate by the same seed being constantly sown but this year the proprietors have provided the tenants with great quantities of champion potatoes which ought to produce a very considerable change for the better for the next few years
Not to a great extent
They generally just sow the seed they raise themselves
Distinctly
Yes
It began at Kilmuir with the township of Valtos and I should state with reference to that township that it arose in consequence of an allegation made by the tenants that the ground officer upon the estate gave in for the summing of the township two cows more than the real number
When Major Fraser was satisfied about the correctness of that he at once agreed to reduce the rent but that was the beginning of it
Very much
Well there was always a certain amount of complaint about the rents but there is that everywhere and as I have said tenants who have made large fortunes to my knowledge and bought estates have said to me that the rents were too high
There was no combination till after the Irish affair
It depends on the manner in which it is carried out
Within legal limits and provided it is carried out legally and that the law is not infringed but I cannot say that about Skye
Well I know that the officers of the law at the time of the Valtos agitation were afraid to go there and would not go on account of threats used against them
At the same time I must say that the tenants on Major Frasers estate are a most respectable and excellent body of men
Well I dont think there was any deforcement there so far as I am aware
I do not go that length
I say that I think these outside influences stirred up a great many things and made grievances of things which would otherwise be viewed with perfect equanimity and made the people discontented
I have frequently refused increased offers of rent for lands
Well every rule has an exception but I dont remember any
Most distinctly it is not
I misunderstood you what I mean to say is that the crofts are not put up to competition
I know it has been greatly raised
I dont want to conceal anything in the slightest degree and I think it has been very nearly doubled
I can put in the exact figures
Yes but that is not to say that Major Fraser is asking a farthing more than the value of the lands
It may be that the other proprietors have not asked the value of their lands
I know they have not done so for the last sixty years
I do not think so
I do not think so
I have always made it a rule in dealing with the small tenants if at all possible to exact the whole rent because they fall into arrear very frequently if you do not do so and the consequence is that they themselves get into difficulties
It is the best thing for the small tenants to exact the whole rentnot rigidly but with discretion
I thoroughly believe there would because the crofters I believe would offer enormous rents for the lands whether they could continue to pay these rents is another question
I cautioned Mr Malcolm frequently to remember that he was not on the east coast
I think it would be in harvest
I believe that the Braes with Ben Lee added to them now at the present rent are excellent value
I believe that honestly and entirely irrespective of my situation as factor
Well he is acquainted with crofters in other parts
I must observe that it is extremely difficult to get any person in Skye to value crofterslands because if a person in Skye values crofterslands and raises the rents the whole body of the crofters are down upon him and abuse him for ever afterwards so people in Skye are very reluctant to do anything of that sort
Well proprietors very often have to borrow money
I dont know whether Major Fraser borrowed the money or not
I am not aware that it came out of any other pocket
No they are not and these improvements were effected long before the passing of the present Road Act
Well I think there was an arrangement by which he got   or  but I believe he spent a good many thousands
That was only for the maintenance of the roadsnot the construction
He spent many thousands on the construction and I may add further that the sum he got towards the maintenance did not half pay the maintenance
He lost by that arrangement
The road under the trustees only goes as far as a place called Loch Mealt
Up to that place the road trustees are responsible
The people of the east side are now appealing to the road trustees for assistance to extend the road as far as Valtos
I am very much in favour of the trustees extending the roads to these townships all through the island
Yes but we have to get the road trustees to see that
A very large sum
If I had been told beforehand I would have been ready with it but I am quite sure I am within the mark when I say that  or  has been expended there
I can get that
I would rather give in the figures
I do not think so because the crofters would not like to pay the interest upon the trenching money
Yes a good deal has been spent on buildings and so forth
Yes and on roads probably more than for the crofters
I know that it requires a couple of new stones
I have been trying to get them
I believe they will be put in before the present crop is ripened
No
Well I cannot speak with certainty
I would rather not say because I am not sure but I know the other townships claimed rights as well as them and they will come forward and state that to the Commission if necessary
I am perfectly satisfied that those three townships never at any period had exclusive right to the hill and I am more satisfied of that now than ever I was
Well they got other places
A little later I think or about the same time but I think some have been cited to appear before the Commission from those townships
They got other places instead
I state what I know about that as a Skyeman and what I was told when very young that any of Lord Macdonalds tenants might put their cattle there
Well the people of Strath have told me frequently that they often used to send their cattle there to be wintered
Yes
I am only stating what the Strath people say I cannot tell whether as matter of fact it is true or not
No
I said I could not see anything of that in our books
If that was the case it must have referred to a much more early period than I have a record of
Yes that may be true
It may be perfectly true but I cannot say anything about it
I am satisfied those three townships are in a complete mistake as to having sole right to Ben Lee
No I did not go that length I said we frequently give permission to them to cut thatch in certain parts of the forest at certain times of the year
There is no occasion to prohibit them
They are allowed on the Macleod estate to go to Coruisk
There is nothing to be seen
It is very probable and that notice may be very necessary but I do not believe it is intended to be carried out in its full sense
I am sure that if you choose to go up on the hills we will not object to it
I am sorry to hear it
But he was a Sassenach and did not know better
At Ulinish
I think it will be a loss to Macleod of probably   a year
Perhaps he might but I dont know
Mr Gibbons was the factor then and I do not know that Macleod knew very much about it personally
Yes but it should be understood that in those days the crofters really asked very little and that this demand for more land on the part of the crofters has really to a great extent come as a surprise upon the landlords
Well the crofters did not use to ask for it and the landlords thought they did not want it
Now they ask for it and the landlords ought to try and meet them as far as they can half way
I have no doubt they did in those days
The tenants in Minginish were not removed
If you refer to Boswells Life of Johnson you will find that the Macleods of these days were entirely against emigration and did all they could to prevent it
There were leases granted I think of very long endurance to some tenants in Minginish and it is said that those tenants or tacksmen as they were called in those days were the causeI dont wish to mention any namesbut it is said whether truly or not I can not tell
I think it is but in the case of Macleod of Macleod he had to go away and leave his estate and work harder than any of his crofters and he did so
He thought he could improve his property immensely by spending money in draining trenching fencing and enclosing and I believe that the real cause of his difficulties was that that was overdone
He got practical agriculturists from the south who advised him to do a number of things for the improvement of his estate and he spent too much money on the estate
Consequently he fell into difficulties and then he went to London and worked very hard for a number of years till at last he rose to the head of his own department and he has now retired
Well he comes down frequently to Skye
You know that his house was carried away by a flood
It is a shooting lodge
I have no doubt if he had a house he would reside here
Well I know him to be a very kindly man and I believe if he were living here the relations between him and his tenants would improve that they would know each other and like each other
Yes a very old form about the year
I shall be very glad to do so
It was prepared by my late grandfather when he was factor for Lord Macdonald and I believe it may be suitable with some modifications
Yes
I have not any of the new copies
Yes
Yes I think the proprietors will allow me to give them I have none myself
No
It is extremely difficult to get the tenants to change their habits but it might be tried
Yes
I think it would be better for the Sconser people if they could get a better place than that altogether
I believe it was
I quoted the same rent
I do not understand
I quoted for the very same rental and year the rent of the small tenants and the rent of the tacksmen
Yes I had not the big tenantsrent for  but I had it for
I believe it was
It was the rental of  that I quoted in both cases
In both cases distinctly the quotation was perfectly uniform
I selected the townships specially for that purpose
Yes
I selected them for that
I put in only those that I knew and could speak about
I looked very particularly about that
I am not aware
It is possible I may be wrong but if I am wrong I shall be very glad to be put right and to correct my statement but I think it embraces every township unless there may be very trifling exceptions
I know of none
Well I looked as minutely as possible and I think the statement is correct
But a number emigrated
But there is a considerable increase in the towns and villages besides
That is what I have been told and read
I have stated all I know about it
It was not in my time
I know they could not at the present day take all the big farms
I should like very much if the people would show that they could take them and stock them as then there would be a great deal of our difficulty removed
I should think the public prosecutor ought to take it up because the landlord or the factor unless he is a man of iron could not prevent subdivision
 think the fiscal should have it in charge it is so difficult to prevent it
Most distinctly I do not think that any subdivision should be allowed at all
I know I never could prevent it entirely
Distinctly
No but I should be very glad to see facts that would change my opinion
I mention the township of Glenhinnisdale where the rents are from  to  just now
I know we could get more rent for Glenhinnisdale than we are getting just now from those tenants if it were let
We do not want the tenants to remove if they just continue to stock the place and pay their rents I know that for a fact
I honestly think so from my experience and if the reverse could be proved I think at once there would be a great revolution in the north
Not many
There are some at  s and  I daresay there are some at  too but very few indeed
I have found in Glenhinnisdale very great complaints
I have no doubt if it comes to be found that the crofters can pay as good rents as the tacksmen it will make a great change in the opinions of proprietors
Farms from   to   let better than any other farms
I told you of my experience about Suishnish I had not a single offer from all Skye to come forward and take those crofts at   each

No unless I got the whole because the rest would be all in our own hands
I think it reasonable to expect that in all Skye with a population of  there would be six men to take that farm
I would sooner let a  place at  each than I would let a  place at   each
I did not want them to join if they had just come forward about the same time
Taking Suishnish and Borroraig which were divided into six lots if six men came forward and said they would take it and could pay for the stock I would recommend Lord Macdonald to let them have a trial of it
We would do something in that way as an experiment to see whether it would suit
No
We were to build the house for one tenant if he would come forward
We would not do so and retain the remaining five sixths
I would like to do that but if the   crofting system would do at that surely there are six men in Skye who would take it
Yes out of the  there are in Skye
Whether he is entitled to do it or not he generally does it
Yes
Sometimes he has a lease and sometimes only one year of it
No but we will be very glad to give them leases if they want them and undertake to improve their crofts
I believe I am right in saying that the proprietor would do that
That is ridiculous
I think those statements are to be taken cum grano
No fence
To follow the deer but not to shoot the tenants
We cannot be responsible for all that English sportsmen coming up here do or Highland sportsmen either
I suppose people very often do a great deal more than they are entitled to do
I would never consent to the shooting tenant having leave to shoot the tenants dogs
Before we shoot their dogs we ask their leave
I never had a dog shot in my life without asking the owners leave and consent
They generally will not consent
I have known crofters shoot each others dogs however without leave
No I do not say that
I think there is a legal right on the part of the tenant to follow the deer on to the crofters ground
I believe that is quite the law
It is no hardship at all not the slightest
If the deer runs what is the harm of the sportsmen going after it
No true sportsman would ever dream of shooting a deer standing in the corn
I would no more do that than I would shoot at a sitting grouse
There may be occasional cases of that sort but he is a very poor sportsman who would shoot deer in the corn
It is only on the hillside that the deer are shot
It may have been done but it was utterly unsportsmanlike and unusual and a thing I never saw or heard of
Distinctly if the shooting tenant was doing any harm
Most certainly we would protect our small tenants against anything that is done wrong to them
I think that wherever a lot has been divided if possible it should be brought back to its original condition
Yes by the crofters
Well the factors did not wish to be hard on the tenants and did not evict them
I can conceive that factors in the old times were not so strict but subdivision goes on in such a way that it is difficult to prevent it
I believe so
I think the tenant from Braes statedI never heard of it beforethat a crofter was to be put on his lot for the sake of a man at Tormichaig but that he resisted it and that another person had been turned out that is all I know about it but I understood in a general way that they were provided for in some way
Not so far as I know
They may have emigrated
So far as I know
It was long before my time
Some of them may have emigrated
Because though there is a change in the value of gold the rent continues the same
He will earn   instead of    but his rent is the same
Money and labour
I understood from the accounts I had of the crofters in my early days that they lived in a different and much more frugal way than they live nowadays
But it is not confined to the crofters because all classes live in a more luxurious way than they used to do
I believe they are better clothed
Yes and better fed
I believe they themselves think otherwise because any class of people in looking back upon old times praise the old timesfrom the days of Homer downwardsinstead of the present time but all the histories we have show that the crofters live much better now than they did in older times because they used to bleed their cattle to keep them through the year Martin says so in his History of the Western Islands
I have been told by those who lived immediately before me that the crofters look better and live better and are much stronger than when they lived on potatoes and I believe that to be true because oatmeal is a much better food than potatoes are
I believe that is true
There were more eggs because they did not give the eggs for tea as they do now
I know that is the popular opinion but when I read what Johnson Boswell Burt and others say I find that the children were not half clad and the men were not half clad and accounts are given that would horrify us in the present day
If I did not believe that old men were prone to think that things were better in their youth than now I would believe what the crofters say for I do not believe that they have stated otherwise than  truthfully whether it is true or not
I cannot tell relatively but I know that the large farms pay much more per acre
I cannot do it without making a calculation but I think the increase must have been more upon the large farms
I cannot state it positively
Not much
It may be he is a very respectable man
But the question is whether the croft was worth  in  though the rent was only  s d in  I observe however that the  s d is only for the half year
That is very easily seen by the valuation rolls and rental
I think it is about it
But that same rent of  s was not changed before since
No I cannot tell you the rent of it separate from a number of other places
Not so far as I know
Very little indeed was done upon the big farms except upon buildings with the one exception of the farm of Monkstadt upon which a considerable sum was expended by the proprietor in draining the loch
I know of no other expenditure upon the large farms of Kilmuir except on buildings
No
I do not suppose John Mackenzie ever asked it or would wish it or would pay the interest upon it
I fancy he is quite contented with his house
Not if the place is worth the double rent
A place that has not been changed since  may possibly be changed without any hardship
I fancy it was not the crofter it was the change in the times
No one
There was a man who came forward from another property who said he would take one half of it but none came forward for one sixth
Six tenants to come forward out of about  people is no great matter
Surely if all the crofters in Skye want more land and can stock it six could be found to take Suishnish which is beautiful land
Most distinctly
Most distinctly
I would never dream of allowing any shooting tenant to interfere with any crofters use of his own grazing land
No that is an old hunting privilege which any Highlandman will be glad to allow to his neighbour and he will be glad to see him stalking deer on his ground if he is a true Highlander
I think he would be a very poor crofter who would not enjoy seeing a man stalking a deer
Yes or on any ground
The whole sums decerned against him by the sheriff for damages expenses and one thing and another came to 
The sheriff decerned against him for all matters due to the laird  but the sum due for rent was  s
Id
I think
And he continued in possession for six months in spite of law and everything
The incoming tenant complained grievously of not getting possession at Whitsunday and made a claim of damages against us
The laird did not get a single farthing but his rent and anything that was over the incoming tenant got
It was put to his credit for the value of the houses
Just a few pounds after paying law expenses
I did
Major Fraser had a decree and we struck it off
We did not want to be hard upon the old man
I do not think I took 
I think the bill was taxed
I think I got the taxed expenses or near about that  but I was not very particular in making up the bill knowing that Donald Nicolson was a very obstinate old chap and that it was his obstinacy that put him in this scrape more than anything else
There was  that is to say two rents but we did not get that we credited that to the incoming tenant
Not for the landlord
The thing is this we got  for the rent that is to say we got the whole years rent but we did not get this at all it was credited to the incoming tenant and it was perfectly fair because the incoming man had to keep up a stock elsewhere by not getting possession at the term and he suffered a lot of damage by it
We only got the rent and no more than the rent and   or   was credited to the incoming tenant
We did not get a penny but the rent
Not a copper
It was all credited to the value of the incoming man
Nothing
I think between  and 
On three occasions
There was a summons to remove an action of interdict and an action of breach of interdict with concurrence of the procuratorfiscal
Court expenses and taxed by Mr Maclachlan the sheriffclerk depute and passed by him as right
I did all I could do to prevent that man ruining himself with expenses
I begged of him not to do it but he would not listen to me or to his own agent
He got Mr MLennan
No he acted as agent for Nicolson and told him he was acting in a most ridiculous way and advised him not to run himself into expenses and trouble
Many clients are not satisfied when they are told to make peace they prefer to be egged on to war and Nicolson went to Inverness
He was bound to do so
 do not think he had and it is a good thing for him that he had not because his expenses would have been three times more than they were
Well I have no doubt that the two practising agents will be delighted if another agent will come here and start
As my name has been mentioned I may say that I was bound officially to give my concurrence to the application by Major Fraser for which I got a fee of s d
I had acted for Nicolson for a  considerable time
I tried to persuade him to be reasonable and I failed
I was bound to give my concurrence as procuratorfiscal when it was asked but at the same time I state distinctly and I wish the Commission to understand that if he had had a defence considering there was no other agent to defend him notwithstanding that I had given my official concurrence to the petition I would have done all in my power to defend him
Yes
Most distinctly
Hearing the cry for land I thought this was a good opportunity for establishing what I myself theoretically considered a good class of tenants but I failed
No that did not occur to me
In letting a new place I think we should try to do better than that
I think   tenants a better class than  ones
I can only say that I still most distinctly adhere to my statement that such an inhuman expression as that I am perfectly certain I never gave utterance to
I must have been misunderstood there must have been some misconception
No
but not a single one appeared
I wrote to two or three personally but they did not come
If the persons could satisfy me that they had the means of stocking I would give a lease at once
Yes or ten years
The whole thing would be an experiment and I think there would be no difficulty about the lease at all
Ten or fifteen years
No not as a rule unless by special stipulation
There may be a break sometimes
Yes
The entire population of the three islands would when Mr Wood acquired them at Whitsunday  be about  As taken by the census in  it was about  and it is now estimated at  showing an increase of about eighty or  per cent
This increase has arisen mainly it is believed from two causes namely  the introduction of managers and farm servants with tradesmen and   the natural increase of the families of the resident crofter population
Daring these seven years very few of the people had left the island permanently
With reference to the pauperism the numbers on the poor roll at present are sixteen being a ratio of  per cent on the average population of Raasaysay while the other portion of the parish of Portree has a ratio of  per cent on a population of  Raasay in this respect will bear a favourable comparison with any of the bestconditioned parishes in the Highlands and even with the bestconditional rural parishes in agricultural districts of the Lowlands of Scotland
The number of acres in Raasay Rona and Fladda is roughly estimated at about  whereof there is supposed to be in proprietors hands as farms woods and policies about  acres are the remainder of  is held by the crofters lotters and cottagers
Of the  acres in the proprietors hands about  are now under cultivation in gardens and nurseries in policies in woods and plantations and in sheep and pasture lands connected with his sheep and arable farmers and of the  acres occupied by the crofters and other small tenants about  are cultivated and the remaining  acres are occupied by them as pasture
The whole extent capable of profitable improvements including the portions already under cultivation is estimated at about  acres
There were on the rentroll at last audit day Martinmas  six tenants paying under   of rent under    under   at    at    at   at   in all  crofters The average rental for the last six years has been  s d and the average rent per tenant of the same period  s
Eleven lotters have gardens or potato plots under half an acre
Sixtyseven crofters have three to four and a half acres of cultivated ground judged from the quantity of seed sown together with their share of the hill ground or commonty and the remaining three tenants are not connected with the tenantry grounds
On crofts under   there will be generally about four cattle of all ages and on crofts above  about eight and the crofters mostly all keep sheep numbering from  to  according to their circumstances
No removals have taken place at the instance of the proprietor since he acquired the estate but he has planted nine new tenants on a portion of the sheep farm and these enjoy privileges like the others and for them he has built good slated cottages and done other things to promote their comfort
They have already improved in all about eighteen acres
Fully ninetenths of the whole tenantry have other occupations than that of applying themselves exclusively to the working of their land and add considerably to their means of living by either themselves or members of their families employing themselves at the several estate works and at the salmon white lobster and herring fishing as well as at other industries both at home and beyond the islands but their chief employment since the entry of Mr Wood has been at the various improvements carried on by him in buildings improvements on land trenching draining planting roadmaking c the aggregate amount of which has been very large
Since his entry the proprietor has encouraged his tenantry by building six new crofters houses all slated at an expense of  three lodges for cottars at  four cottagers houses at  and rebuilding six cottar houses at  in all  Then thirteen crofters have been each allowed   to build better houses  and there has been expended in wood for doors and windows roofing and inside fittings and ironmongery to a large number of crofters for the six years for the same purpose  s
This gives a total of  s
When Mr Wood first took possession of the estate of Raasay he felt disposed to erect houses for his tenants
Experience however showed that such a system would be both expensive and unsatisfactory
He consequently came to the resolution that it would be much more advisable to furnish the tenants with wood and slate and make a certain allowance of money for building purposes leaving it to themselves to do the work
This course was carried into effect with  considerable success and will no doubt eventually tend to the clearance of the present houses
Mr Wood offered to lay concrete floors for the tenants if they would provide gravel and sand
He has also paid  for bulls for improving their stock and has given in loan for purchasing stock in necessitous cases   for replacing herring boats and nets destroyed by storms  and for replacing tenants boats destroyed by high tides and gales in November   s d
Again during Mr Woods possession there has been expended by him in work to inhabitants of the island up to May   s d
     s d
   s d
   s and   s d in all s d exclusive of main building connected with the mansionhouse
The number of people permanently employed immediately before the acquisition of the estate by Mr Wood was about twentyfour but the number may be now stated at ninetyfour or nearly a fourfold increase and mostly all connected with works which require a permanent staff
The average yearly amount expended among the people resident in the island over the six years is  s being equal to s d for each one of  inhabitants or  s d for each family of six members and is about equal to nine rents of the crofters average rental of  s d and it is believed that fully more than onehalf of this annual outlay passed directly into the hands of the crofters or into those who were members of their families and over and above these considerable amounts came into the crofter population from those contractors and others who were temporarily resident on the island during the execution of the several undertakings
A considerable part of the expenditure of course fell into lowcountry tradesmens hands
The proprietor has during the six years expended  s d on the various improvements and other outlays on the estate over and above all receipts that he has got there from
During that period he has remitted rents to tenants to the extent of  s d has given gratuities of meal and coals to people to the value of  s d and has granted free of rent houses to five widows equal to  making  s d
To meet disasters of seasons  and  he has paid twothirds of the price for replacing tenantrys boats destroyed by high tide and gale in November  amounting to   s  d  tons of seed in the spring of  which had been given free of charge to tenants in quantities from  to  bolls  and abatement of onethird of the years rent due at Martinmas   s d  while labour at good wages and at convenient places has been offered to all his people who are disposed to accept it
The position of the people now as compared with their state in  is one of great improvement
Better dwellinghouses have been provided where necessary work is provided for all who may require it at wages from s  to s a week and no wellconducted person has been refused employment who has asked for it
Crofts have been improved by the erection of substantial fences between the arable and pasture lands but most of the crofts are capable of much further improvement such as the clearing out of open drains between the plots of arable land cutting or cleaning out of drains around their dwellinghouses and the observing of a proper system of rotation of crops and the sowing of grass seeds instead of allowing to lie for a time out of cultivation and thus giving room for the growth of coarse plants or weeds to shed their seeds
The breed of cattle has been greatly improved as the tenants have had the use of wellbred bulls from the proprietor
The improvement in this respect is becoming more apparent every year and the value of the stock will doubtless go on in an increasing ratio as the younger cattle as breeding stock take the place of the older and with more attention to the feeding and general comfort of the stock would greatly enhance their market value
The opening up of some of the roughest parts of the estate by new roads has also been of great benefit to the people
The road from Torrin to KyleRona  miles  feet wide cost  There are three board schools at Clachan Torrin and Dryharbour
The proprietor has been at an expense of  s d in erecting and fitting up two suitable meetinghouses in connection with the Free Church at Rona and Torrin for the people of those districts which has contributed greatly to their convenience and comfort It has been already stated that the annual value of the gross raw produce from arable and pasture lands is estimated at  and that the proprietors average annual outlay passing into the hands of the resident population for wages has been  s
Further the privileges of free peat fuel and seaweed are afforded them the value of which added to the abovenoted labour fund would amount to a sum nearly equal to the also abovenoted amount of  for the whole production from arable and pasture lands
This is considered a very important and as regards the Highlands a very exceptional fact
As perhaps fourfifths of the population of Raasay belong to the crofter class and it is conceived not unreasonable to infer that more than onehalf of the labour fund above alluded to passed into their hands which would be about equal in amount to the whole annual value of raw produce from their arable and pasture lands  or in other words doubling their annual domestic earnings
In its effects upon the condition of the people a result like this greatly more than realises the design of Sir John Sinclair who when he laid down his scheme for putting the population of the Highlands on small lots made it part of his plan that each tenant should have provided for him in addition to his lot two hundred days a year of extra work a provision which unfortunately was not carried out but which if it had would it is believed have obviated the necessity for all claims for aid for the people from without and would have kept them from want during any and all of the periods of destitution that have occurred since the system was first introduced into the northern Highlands
It appears also that the fact of so much money being spent annually for labour by the proprietor of Raasay among his people has this additional importance attached to it that as it is mainly all connected with undertakings having permanent annual requirements the amount so long as these works are carried on can scarce ever suffer a very material reduction
Since Mr Wood purchased the estate of Raasay he has made it the home of himself and his family making the condition of his population a matter of personal interest and care
There are no leases on the property the tenants holding simply from year to year
It is to be regretted that the Education Act so far as the parish of Portree is concernedis not vigorous enforced
If report speaks truly and there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of it there is a large proportion of the children of the parish attending no school a matter of deep regret
If properly administered an educational system would in all probability do more for the Highlands of Scotland than almost any scheme which can be suggested
With regard to Fladda Mr Wood thought at one time with some degree of reason that possibly a slate quarry might be opened there and he took every means to ascertain the way it could be opened first with a view of getting slates and secondly with a view of providing labour but scientific people reported it would not work
With regard to the Oscaig cottages there was a man here who said he paid  which was quite true
The original intention of these was not with a view to crofters at all
When Mr Wood took possession of the estate he was of opinion it would be a good thing if he could induce such men as tailors and shoemakers to come and encourage them to work and these cottages were originally built for those men as trade cottages and they cost more than they would have done for other purposes
But then that would not suit so he added small crofts to them
As to the game Mr Wood has reduced the stock of sheep fully twoeighths from what it was during the time of Mr Mackay
Originally the stock had been about  and they are down to  The difference between  and  goes to provide for the game
Yes
I think there is a portion of it but I dont know how much it is
Yes
Yes and keep them away from his tenants and so far as Raasay is concerned every part of the crofters crops is separated from the shootings by ordinary fences and rabbitnet wire all except a very small portion which they are just completing
Then there was a statement made about a fence that the deer fence came too close to the hill land and they could not drive the cows up to the hill ground without trouble
The facts are these that Mr Wood is very anxious there should be no  disturbance and he asked the township to appoint a man to lay out the route of the fence
The oldest man was appointed and he went to the place and the fence was put in the exact place that man suggested
I dont know what Mr Woods instructions are
He stays here eight or nine months in the year and keeps almost all these things in his own hands
For instance he calculates what damage is done by game and he pays that in money
I know in several cases he has paid in money the full amount of damage that they had sustained
I am informed by the manager that Mr Wood has not given authority or refused authority to kill rabbits
Nothing has been done in fact
That is a hard question
He might get scolded
Yes there is a pretty large stock
I suppose the damages are for both pheasants and other game altogether
We feed them very highly and dont let them fly upon the crofts if we can help it
No difficulty whatever
Deer and sheep are all together
Not exclusively for deer
There were some complaints before this fence was put from sea to sea
A six feet wire fence
There has been no complaint made since
Mr Ross
As to whether it can be done with advantage to the tenant I think it follows that if you could give him more land and a better bit of it he would be better off
I think there can be no possible doubt about that position
With regard to the second question as to whether Mr Wood would cut off the upper part of the islandwhether it would be a benefit to him that is another question
For instance a tenant has to build a house he has to drain he has to get stock
I dont see where the money is to come from
I am sorry to say I am informed there is on this estate a considerable amount of debt already due to merchants and people of that sort so I dont see even if they got facilities to go to the upper part of the island how they could possibly do it
As your Lordship has put it I am not aware of Government ever giving money to buy stock
Mr Stewart
Where the present tenants pasture is held and where Mr Woods pasture comes up alongside of it the tenants upon his borders might be benefited but unless the tenants were altogether removed from one district and planted on his land I dont see that additional pasture to the tenants would be advantageous
In their present places they hold all the hill pasture
It is all held by the tenants in common
Mr Woods sheep farm is all to one side and there is a small narrow neck of land where this fence crosses dividing Mr Woods sheep farm from the tenants pasture
It could only be done that way by shifting the fence more into the sheep farm
It would only give the Arnish tenants who lie alongside the sheep farm advantage not any of the others
Mr Ross
I have no doubt they do now and again
The gatekeepers are not so careful as they should be
Yes
 acres so far as I can see assuming the whole area to be  acres
Yes and there is this further question so far as Mr Wood is concerned
I doubt whether it would suit his views because we know he bought Raasay more as a sporting estate than anything else and if this were carried out it is questionable whether it would suit his views to continue on his estate
I think it is natural to them to love their country
I also think they have been inspired by people with ideas that they should stick to their land and get their own terms
I believe both elements have been at work
We know quite well that the Highlander does like his country and does not like to leave it  but at the same time like every one else if you show him good cause he will probably go
There have been people going about showing them why they should not go and that is probably one of the causes
But my opinion is that emigration is the only cure
I think not if conducted with fairness and well managed
They must go with their own conviction and not forced if possible
You will observe these schedules are very voluminous and the information cannot be got by the proprietor unless he goes about and asks people and I quite understand there may be discrepancies
That is what I mean
It goes from two to one hundred
Yes I am surprised at it
I am perfectly certain that Mr Wood when settling the compensation used to pay it directly
When he paid money he seldom took a receipt because he went over the damaged ground himself and fixed the amount but in many cases I think he gave more than the amount
I can suggest nothing just now
I have inquired about that and I am told by the keeper who was in charge that he never knew of any such thing
The statement was perfectly new to him
Yes
The teacher who is here is a young lady from Aberdeenshire but I may explain that the teacher who has the permanent appointment here is an inhabitant of the asylum at Inverness
This is only a locum tenens and she may or may not remain
Yes the only cure if fairly carried out
No I wont go that length
My view is that not less than  per cent would meet the requirements of the case
I would not take isolated cases but by townships and therefore not injure the natural feelings that exist between them
If you take whole townships and provide for them when they go out the natural feeling against emigration would not be so great
I bow to that at once
It would be easier to send them to the upper end of Raasay
For instance he set to work up about Portree to take in about  or  acres from the hill side and employed people to do it
Yes
Mr Stewart
All the tenants at Balchuirn
The tenants of Braig also received compensation
I would divide the land among the neighbouring townships to increase the holdings
My difficulty is this that the Highlander has a very proper and natural liking for his own country and if you give him an opening of comparative comfort in his native place rather than go to another place where he will have some hardships to start with naturally he will elect to remain at home
I dont think he will select emigration
I think you must decide upon one or other whatever it is
No I dont say it is
I am not wanting more land than I have
It will serve me my lifetime
But the land is dear and is spoiled by game the same as others have said so that it is scarcely worth while to sow my land
It is a very difficult thing for a man to go and complain to his landlord even if it was the case that his crop was spoiled
Our landlord is kind and honourable and condescending to us in every way but after all that loss is upon us
We must try to stand it when that heavy rent is upon us
I have however to say concerning myself that if the rent was lower than what it was in my fathers time we would not be saying much about it
No and they are quite thick in our arable ground
I have nothing further to say
Yes
Three
I wish to state simply what others have saidheavy rent
We were put in Braig ten years ago and where we were before we could keep four cows
We have only two now
I think they died because of the scantiness of the grazing on our crofts
Yes two died
There is a family on each croft
Four cows but three were quite enough to get justice
Five ewes
No but there is one ass next to the lighthouse
One stirk
Yes

Two cows one stirk and five sheep
Yes it was Mackay who raised it
He shifted us from Dryharbour to the place where we are now near the lighthouse that he might get additional rent of the place and he laid   upon the three of us
No nothing
We ourselves built our houses in Mackays time
I am one of the hands of the lighthouse packet
I think if the people were thinned that those who remained would get proper pieces of land
They would be shifted up to the townships which are waste in Raasay
I have not ascertained that they would be willing to emigrate
They think that they would make a living in this place itself if it was left to a few
To New Zealand
I dont know
I think that they get land until they pay for it
Yes until they pay for it
Some of them I understand get twenty years or thereby to pay it
Yes
Yes
I have not much to say but the truth
I make it out that should I be here from sunrise to sunset I could not fully disclose the poverty of Rona
It is a place in which no man need expect to make his living
We are working on sea and land both summer and winter and springevery quarter of the yearand after that we have only poverty
I cannot say but that Mr Wood is a kind man ever since we saw himkind to the poor and helpful to the widows but we will ever be poor as long as we are kept crowded in a place of which we cannot make use
I can say with truth that my skiff is my cart and that the wives and the children are the horses and there is truth in that because it is the work of the horses which they perform
The creel is on their back continually and after being worked so hard as that they cannot make a living out of it
I myself remember the township in which I am being in possession of one man
Then four had it
Now eight have itI mean eight familiesand I make out there are fifty souls in the township
That one man was paying  s of rent and now the rent is   but it is Mr Mackay who raised the rent Mr Wood has left it as he found it
All the new houses which have been built have been built by Mr Wood
There were no new houses built until Mr Wood became the proprietor
Two came from KyleRona and the rest was their own increase
They were getting no other place in which to live
I dont think any one could make a living in Rona as long as they live crowded upon each other as at present
I never built a new house
I would get the house built for me  but I was not seeing it worth my while building a house for the plot of land I had
In the same township
It was Mr Wood who gave him the timber
Yes
Yes he is very good for giving timber to people
No it is the old block house I have
There are no slated houses in our township
I believe that they will never be well off till that is done
Yes I have been long willing
That is the reason why I dont want to build a house
I cannot say that they did
I am told there are some who asked to get land and they told me so but they did not get the land yet and I did not hear what the reply was
I was speaking once or twice about a place to the manager and the reason for not granting the request was that there was no vacant place for me
There are more of my friends in America and Australia than there are in Raasay and I have not seen or heard that my father or mother got a paper or a letter asking them to go out there and I am not aware that a   note or a Is ever came to them to help them to show that that land was better than the place they had left
But dont you think that people who go to these far away places are apt to neglect their friends not because they are not successful but just because they become forgetful of friends
I believe there are plenty letters coming from others but I never heard of them asking people to go out there
No I would like to have a place in the land of my birth
I cannot know about that but I have no mind to go abroad
It is likely
I am there for some time past at any rate and I am trying sea and land and every one in the place is in the same way
We have gone to the east coast fishing with our bags to sell ourselves there to the highest bidder and after all I have known many coming home and the masters could not after the fishing was over give them one shilling of their own earnings to bring them home
The fishing is only a lottery
One year it may be successful and another time the contrary and that happened to me often
We would know how to work them but we have another thing against that
I think when a man is dealing with a croft it is enough for him to attend to the croft itself and the one thing is only spoiling the other
If I was to be a fisherman I would be a fisherman if I was to be a crofter I would be a crofter and I think if that would not be the case it would simply be spoiling both
I have said already the fishing is only a lottery and we are not in a good fishing place at all unless we are to go to other places
I can only give my own opinion but I myself have been going to sea ever since I could
I tried the fishing and it defied me
I am thinking now that if a man could get in a good place a bit of ground and if he should happen to get stock upon it at one time and to get the land at a reasonable rent it would be better for him than any fishing I have ever seen
Yes
I cannot tell
Mr Rainnie
Some were in Mackays time and others have had their names entered for lots in the township in Mr Woods time
Yes cottars
In Mackays time
Yes
No
He paid for all but one of the houses so far as I understand
No the rent is as Mr Mackay left it
Mr Wood has made no change
Nothing beyond the houses
No not much
There are some places you could drain but before the water could be got to run the rocks would need to be blasted
It is bad ground peaty soil
I cannot understand what expense would accomplish
They were quarrying the stones and they were getting so much for their labour in doing this and Mr Wood was giving timber for internal fittings
Yes
Thatch
Some years I may say with truth that what I get from the oats will not sow the ground next year
Yes
All I have to say is that our land is small and dear and the rent too high

One cow and a stirk
Well we have good comfortable cottages that Mr Wood has built for us there and we are charged mostly for the houses but then we have only a very small patch of land connected with these houses
No I am not entitled to know what the houses cost but I know what I paid for them
I cannot exactly tell that either
Mr Wood built them the first year he came
I had in my memory two tenants or crofters keeping the whole place I am in at the present time between the two
They had the common as well as the rest of the crofters that were on the land
They had liberty to have fifty to sixty sheep and a pair of horses each and they were keeping a summing of eight milk cows coming into their byres and they had some yeld cattle on the hill
I did not enter into the croft until such time as the house was built
The houses are new and the crofts are new at the present time
But I remember when the whole place was occupied by two crofters and there is one park now which measures about nineteen acres taken off the others and occupied by Mr Wood himself
Yes

Yes
Yes
Yes I have no cause of complaint
We get regular work and wages but at the same time we complain of the smallness of the wages as much as of the smallness of the land because people depend merely on the days wages and we suppose s a week is hardly able to keep a family or a family of we such as I have
I have four and my wife and myself it is sixand I consider s a week is barely enough to support me in meat and clothes and to pay the rent
Well most decidedly if I was as comfortably off otherwise
I daresay I could live as my forefathers did live in the worst houses and they lived as old as I will do and my father died last year eighty years of age and I do not know if I will live that long
No
I complain of the house even as it is
I would take the house
I think there are houses that will do the like of a man of my income and be less rented for the income can never pay the outlay
We have to pay the expense that has to come out of them
Yes
Yes
Yes but these only hold one or two apartments only half the house
They have a whole croft but only the half of the house
Donald Gillies and I have a whole house
Yes but I daresay if you put the whole six of us together the whole produce of the land would not keep a horse
Because he has the roads and he cannot work the roads very well without a horse
Yes and I dont know of any man who has been refused work by the proprietor since he came
I believe Mr Wood would not object to us doing it
No
Well I am not supposed to do it
Sometimes I take in lodgers
At s per week which is the regular rule of charge for lodgers but it is very seldom I take them
Yes and the crofts too because we are compelled to pay the extra sum of money for the croft which is a very small portion
I dont believe it is much more than one and a quarter acres of arable land
Yes
Only one
Two rooms and two bedclosets a closet entering from each room
Yes
Yes
There is a kitchen and a closet off the kitchen and at the other end of the house they are the samea room and a closet off the room
There is no stair at all  no ladder
We are provided with a byre and barn for the benefit of the croft
No
No
About eight feet square
You can put a bed in them
No
Yes
I heard they cost about 
Yes
I am not sure whether that is taken in or not
I dont know
We have part of our own croft
Each end has got a crofta strip opposite itself and then there is a piece taken off from every croft and fenced
Yes
It is just one cow we are allowed to keepthe grazing of one cow
We are not allowed to keep sheep but some have kept two or three sheep mostly for petting
Just in the bit of land we have
Scarcely
Yes but there are few of us who have not to buy something
Yes
No I dont think it
We dont blame the landlord in the least because I think the landlord is very kind to us and very good to the people
I daresay we could grow carrots but I dont see much good it would do us
Well I dont know of any garden into which they have either put carrots or peas except one and I daresay that is more for curiosity than for the good of it because carrots and these vegetables do no good to a workman when he has no meat to go with them
They can do that with meat
I was born in the south of Raasay
I was acquainted with the two last lairds MLeod of Raasay
When the first laird got into difficulties Mr MKinnon Corrie was factor and the sheep began to come to this place
The place was getting into debt ever since then
When Mackenzie took the place from Mr Rainy there was in his lease power to clear any township that he pleased and every township was cleared accordingly except those which were not favourable for sheep
The place was spoiled before Mr Wood got it and I have to say for myself and for us all three things that I wish to speak to
We got boats when the storm broke we got a reduction of onethird of this years rent because of the badness of the year and we got seed potatoes
We have now to say of Mr Wood that he is a good landlord
Yes I concur with what the previous delegate said and I have one word to say for myself
I was at the quay when the people were sent off and they were like lambs separated from their mothers
There was one old man there who said Should I go to Australia I may die on my arrival I should prefer remaining in Raasay but I must go
Yes they had the hill from the upper part of Raasay to Scribidale except the square
No that was the first break that was made in the population of Raasay when Corrie became factor and when MLeod left Raasay the place was getting into debt
I cannot remember
The place began to suffer disadvantage ever since Corrie came to be factor
I cannot say
It is more than forty
Mr Harry Macdonald the father of Mr Alexander Macdonald Portree and if any one of us happened to be s in arrears we would be served with a summons of removal and would have to pay s for the summons
No he is dead long ago
They are all dead down to the ground officer
Yes
They  are complaining as others are about the hardness of the land and the  dearness of it
It is dear it is bad and there is little of it
They  are also wanting to speak about the channel between them and the island
They come from the island to the school here and the channel is not  wider than thirty yards at high tide
Sometimes the children are  starving waiting for the tide when they cannot get over when the men  are away from home
Yes but many days they cannot go to school at all
Thirty yards and it is dry at half tide
Either  to bridge the channel or else to give us another place to live in  from which our children could go to school in safety
It would not be difficult at all
There are plenty of materialsplenty of stones thereabout
I think a suspension bridge would be easier made with plenty of stones at each end
It is steep on the Raasay side but it is a gradual slope on the island side
Yes but I think it would cost more than the bridge I allude to
Boats pass through at high tide
About fifty altogether
I have eight myself
I dont know how many the others have
Another man has got quite as many as I have
No  we did not give him a trial at all
Though the rent is high Mr Wood is  not blamed for that it was Mr Mackay and Mr Wood simply left us as he  found us in regard to the rent
Six
The island altogether pays  and before Mr Mackays time it was 
Two cows and two young beasts a stirk and a twoyearold
I am not sure how many sheep the others have but I have five
I dont think any one of us has more than seven
Yes
We work at every work that comes in the way
The only fish we get about our own shores are eels
Yes but it is not good fishing ground for ling
The ground is too foul too deep
If we get anything at that depth it is skate
I  was not there for the past three years
I was staying at home working  for Mr Wood but I have been eighteen seasons at the east coast fishing
No they work a little about this time of the year just to get sufficient money to take them away to the fishing
Yes
It  was high enough
It is too high now but we never complained to Mr Wood  about it
We dont know what he might do if we complained to him
He is  a kind man
If all the island landlords were like him a man might have  remained at home
No  I sowed last year four barrels of oats and I did not reap as much as would sow it back
Yes
From Mr Woods manager I got it last
I might get three returns
In a good year I might get three
Our ground is peat altogether
I think it would
It would take away a good share of our complaints at any rate
Yes and s a week of wages
Yes  but they expect to make three times as much as that per week at the  fishing
Some nights I made  and other nights I made nothing at all  at the east coast fishing
No  I think the fishing is better
When I pay s for lodgings off that  s and also my personal expenses for the week my family would be  starving at home
Twelve miles from here
No
A  few of those living near the square may get work therethe Ballahouran  people but it is up at Mr Woods own house that the most of the work is  to be got
It is bad
You would not think it would keep four sheep altogether
No nothing but limpets and a few whelks
Yes some women work at them
Sometimes Is d and sometimes s d a bushel sometimes d
Two days a bushel at any rate and sometimes three
Our  seaware is out on rocks about our own shores
We have a pretty  sufficient quantity of peat but we have to take it ashore with boats  and then carry it on our backs to the ground
No we dont pay for it
No horses  they would be drowned
Yes
I have not much to say but what others have complained about the land
We have but bad land and there are many of us upon it We are two families on each lot
There are six families and two of them upon each lot and there are two families who have no lot at all
Yes
Three cows and a stirk but when the six are upon the lots they have not got that
One cow and a young beast and seven or eight sheep each
I have seven or eight ewes with lambs
Two cows and two stirks
No
I have not five cows
I have two cows and two stirks
Two cows and two stirks
No
Yes
A little more than four barrels of oats and between five and six barrels of potatoes
I cannot very well know that
Some years
In good years I might be able to make a boll or two of meal
I believe I have near twenty barrels of potatoes in a good year
I had that amount in some years
 Our lot is  but it was  s before for the whole township until Mr Mackays time
Nearly forty years
Three families
Some of them were evicted from other townships
Two families from Hallaig
They came to the one croft
It was in possession of some who had it and went to another place
They were in the township itself
These two families who came from Hallaig would not go to Australia and they were placed among us
Yes
There was another family came from Hallaig
The man came from Hallaig as a boy and married in our township
The natural increase of the township itself
No I am in my own employment
Yes
Employed to plough the park of Waterstein
Last week
Part of my plough was taken away at night
Yes
The coulter was taken out the muzzles were taken away and the swingletree
Yes
They did not ask me to do any more
I dont know
I dont know  I cannot say
I cannot say what was in their minds regarding it
No
I dont know of anything
Yes
From the Tenants of Ferrinvicquarrie
I dont think I have anything further to say
Yes but we have not performed any of the services for the past year
We refused
Not  much threatening for the past year
  but  s was the rent before when Mr Nicolson settled the land
A long time I believe
Yes he raised it  about eight years ago
Twentyone whole crofts but the most of them are subdivided into two halves
There is a family in every half lot
I believe it will be the number
I dont know
There are more than one hundred souls
We were doing that
Yes
We had to split them and to clean and wash them
We were not salting them
The doctor himself had a salter
Yes
Yes and we were doing the work
Yes
It kept us a good while and every day on which we brought fish we would have to perform this service
We would not take much time even should we have to bone fifty fish
We would like better the day on which we had most to do of that work
Yes that is what we complain of
Doubtless it would sometimes
We were not returning them to the store at all
W e were just clumping them on the hillock on which they were dried
The meaning we were taking out of it was that he was a landlord and as the word is might was right with him
That is what I cannot tellthat we ever took it to the doctor himself though perhaps it might be only once a year that I saw the doctor unless the sickness of my family would bring him  but I think I was seeing something harder on me than the doctor I was seeing the factor and he was worse for me than the doctor
Yes
About two years ago
I dont think there is anyone doing his work at any rate  and I feel that there is not a person in this place
No not at present at any rate
I did not hear the doctor putting a price on a beast since Campbell left
When the tenants would be selling the beast to any person that would be coming the way to buy them the threatenings of Campbell would be coming upon those who would do so whether this was with the authority of the doctor or not
Campbell used to come through the place to buy the beasts
Just as he himself thought proper
No a very short time
His own place was near and there was no reason for him to leave them with us
I dont know
It was that the beast would be better with him than with us
He was sending it to better pasture
I do not know what great profit he was allowing the crofter at all
I believe that we would prefer that he should not interfere with our beasts
Sometimes it would be better he should not
Often
Those who were in debt to him he would insist on getting the beast that he chose himself
No indeed they did not
There was no person getting the choice of the beasts as he was getting
Yes
I believe his position as factor gave him an advantage in dealing with us in making up a choice drove
They would be laying that to his charge at any rate
I cannot very well say
Sometimes nothing much more than threatenings followed
I may say that the way in which he was driving ourselves was the hardest treatment we were getting from him
I dont know I did not see the notice
I can neither read nor write
I believe that such notices were posted up
I believe it is
I believe that that was his reason for putting up these notices so far as regards the cattle that have been sold
I dont know
whether to his own ground or to his masters
Yes but we never knew whether they belonged to his master or to himself
 s
I pay  including taxes
I did not appear at the rent collection time at Martinmas last but some who were at the rent collection were saying that these pounds were taken off themthat the increase which was laid upon them eight years ago was taken off
I have two lots
Up to  including everything
I was paying for the doctor
Two cows and a stirk on each croft
Four cows and a threeyearold
I have two stirks besides that
Yes plenty
When the people became so poor that they could not keep them
That they are constantly getting poorer
By the natural increase of the families
Yes  but I wish to say before making any statement that I would wish to have the assurance that the landlord would not do any hurt to me in respect of anything I may say here today
Nothing will be done to him for anything he states so far as my uncle and myself are concerned
I take the opportunity of saying that no one will be molested in consequence of anything that is said today
I never moved a man from my estates if he paid his debts and if he had not been complained of by his neighbours
I never issued a letter of removal for the last seven years
No
Yes
Yes fortyfive years ago I think
Six sheep were left to us
No but it was taken from the Galtrigill people and the people of Galtrigill were crowded upon us
Six sheep were taken from us
Yes
From  s to  s
The valuator of the land thought that some crofts were bettor than others
By Dr Martin
No
I am not sure but I think it is up to forty years
Eight years ago it was raised
My rent was raised  at all events and I think the rent of most of us was raised to the same extent
But when I paid my rent at last Martinmas that  was taken off but I am not sure if that reduction will continue
About seven years
I cannot say that I do remember any except the four of whom the paper speaks
Their holdings were added to the park which Dr Martin has in his own hands
Two of them went to Waternish and I think the doctor himself gave a place to the other two
I cannot tell
Yes
Yes
The croft is not today half what it was worth fortyfive years ago
Turning the ground so often
Fortyfive years ago there was a good depth of sod on our ground but now we have no more than from two inches to six inches in depth the deepest is six inches
We are complaining that the peats are far from us but the landlord cannot help that and as to seaware we are bringing it across the loch a distance of four or five miles
From Claggan
Yes we pay for it
To MLeod of MLeod
Not enough
We cannot say that he demanded labour of us during the past year unless we chose to give it
No he did not ask any money off me the last time I paid my rent
We gave our fish to him but there was no obligation upon us as to the time we fished
No but our cause of complaint was the smallness of the price we got for our fish
We were not getting the price for it
Yes it was the landlord who was taking it from us but the landlord has ceased that now
No there is no fishing at all
About forty years ago it was good fishing ground but since then except in occasional years we could not make what would keep us in shoes or in long lines
No I dont think we have but there is plenty there itself
I paid my rent
I think every one in the township in which I am have paid their rents but I am not sure
They want more land
Our places are so small that we cannot live by them
There is land no doubt but I am not sure
The doctor has not on his property as much land as would do for all the people on his property
We are thinking there is plenty land in the island of Skye if we only got it
Yes but that is gone
Well I have noticed that since the Barra herring fishing commenced we have had no fishing
The dead herring that fall out the nets of the fishermen at Barra are enticing the cod and ling to remain about these places
I dont know but that that was the case some years ago
Not for a year or two
Yes
The postmaster at Dunvegan
In winter d for the cod and d for the ling
I believe we had
d for the cod and d for the ling
I cannot say about that
Yes
Not so far as concerns the fishing
I dont know what convenience it would be unless it would be convenient for the people to land the seaware
Yes so far as the fishing is concerned
We would be the better of a post certainly for the post does not come further than Husabost and it goes there for the sake of the doctor
Our two townships pay a postrunner from Husabost to ourselves
Yes that was when the  was added to our rents
We got one penny of rise in the price of the fish when the  was laid upon our rents but this increase in the price of the fish did not last for more than one winter while the increase on the rents remained
It is in the hands of the landlord for his sheep
Mr Nicolson the present landlords predecessor had it under sheep
Yes
It is many a year
I am not sure
Yes and it has to do with the scarcity in the Lewis  also
Before the Lewis fishing commenced there was plenty of herring to be got here
That is what we think
Yes we could not account for the scarcity of fish here in any other way
It is a long time since we were thinking of it after we could think of no other cause
In my fathers time fish were very plentiful
About  of rent after this reduction of 
I think if half of my arable land were laid upon the other half it would make three acres
Three cows but I cannot keep three cows on it
Two cows
I have one twoyearold and one stirk
The summing is three cows
No barley would not grow upon it
About five bolls
The land which we have requires double the quantity of seed that other land requires
I think it would make about six barrels of the sort of oats which we have ourselves
The best land that we have will yield about one bushel and a half and other parts will not return what is sown
Yes
Very little
If I gave justice to my cattle I could not make any meal
Yes
Six barrels
About thirtytwo
That would be the best year
Yes
The best year
I have seen years quite as bad for potatoes as last year
Sixteen bolls a year
I will have to buy twentyfour bolls this year
Yes and it is little enough
Twelve individuals
But there are two of them not at home just now
Yes
Three cows
No three cows is the summing of every full croft in the township
Yes
Yes the MCrimmons had the township as the hereditary pipers of the MLeods
I cannot tell but my grandfather came to the place when it was first settled and that was eighty years ago
I know of no representative of those in the place a hundred years ago except myselfor those who were settled in the township after MCrimmons left
No
No
My opinion is that in those days of pipe music they were looking more to the Pope than they are today and I believe it is the gospel that has done away with the pipe
It was death that did away with the MCrimmons
I dont care should I not hear music any day of the year if I was well off in other ways
No doubt it would leave us happier but I dont know whether it would set us to dance or no
There is a grandson or a greatgrandson of theirs staying in the place yet
Yes
I think he will be about forty years
He is just as ourselves running north and south for subsistence for our families
Yes
Five families five shares in the township
 That in  Hugh MKay took possession of the third part of this township and continued in possession of the same till  About this date the third crofter in the township emigrated to America whereupon the factor Donald Macdonald Tormore induced him to take half of the township that is the half of the emigrants croft along with his own croft
The factor also assured him that as long as he should remain factor on the estate he would not be altered removed nor deprived of any of the land provided the rent was paid
Mackay had now to leave his own houses without any compensation and buy the emigrants houses
The land at this date ie  was uncultivated to a great extent on the emigrants croft and required many improvements as a great portion of it consisted of peat soil which was also very soft
Mackay set about working the land and improved it considerably
As soon as the factor noticed this it seems he could not think of a better plan than to take the third part from him and give it to one of the tenants removed from Hamara Mhor
The rent was at this time paid
Upon Hugh Mackays death his son occupied his place
The said curtailing was not sufficient with the factor but three years ago he deprived the son the present occupier of a third part of what his father left him
The factor gave this to one of the tenants of Borrodale
In consequence John Mackay the present occupier had now to sell his corn having no stock to consume it
He asked the factor to buy it on private bargain
His answer wasNo there are many in Glendale who are far more in need of that than you
 Then I shall make a public roup
 You are not allowed by the order of the proprietor to do so
Before the land was curtailed Hugh Mackay was in good circumstances but immediately afterwards gradually failed to meet ends so that a brother of the present occupier had to assist him in paying his rent being in circumstances able to do so
But in consequence of a remonstrance from this brother for curtailing the land the factor ceased to send him receipts for the money paid by him for his brother
When the brother noticed the factors intentions he suspended payment The share that Hugh Mackay held when he had half of the township is at present subdivided between three
Besides that one of the tenants removed from Ramasaig has been put upon the township against their will There are now five crofters in the township instead of three
 John Campbell paid rent on this estate for thirtyeight years in this township he paid rent for thirtysix years
His holding is the third part of the township the rent being  s d excluding rates
His rent when paid last amounted to  s d including rates
His croft is the nearest to Hamara Lodge
In  Macleod of Macleod was proprietor and in the said date the estate came under trustees and Hamara Mhor was then tenanted by three crofters viz ground officer and manager for the late Captain Macleod of Orbost and another subtenant
In the same year he was deprived of part of his croft which was added to Hamara Mhor
In the following summer he mowed the grass on the part taken from him but they took it from him
Hugh MCaskill being then factor he demanded justice of him which was firmly refused
Harry Macdonald succeeded M r MCaskill and all he desired was rent failing to give so he would be removed
Harry Macdonald was succeeded by Donald Macdonald Tormore
John Campbell took Donald Macdonald and the ground officer to look at what he had been deprived of and he said that it was quite possible that it was his the crofters right
Shortly after wards he spoke to him to restore him his land but he replied he would not settle the matter more than the preceding factors
When he demanded justice of the ground officer he was answered  You may be thankful if left in possession of what you have
There is about thirteen or fourteen years since Tormore got Hamara Mhor into his possession causing great annoyance to him for herding in winter as Hamara is not fenced to keep sheep and cattle from crossing over
A herd is engaged to keep away neighbouring stock
His stock is generally maltreated by the herd and his dogs owing to the reckless state of the forementioned township
John keeps four cows a horse and twenty sheep and he states his croft is inadequate to feed his stock
In winter to give any thing like justice half the stock would be sufficient for the croft
Our sole request is that the following be considered by the Royal Commissioners  That we get our holdings extended   That our rents be abated   That inducements be given us to build good houses    That compensation be granted for improvements   That we desire permanent security against the oppression of landlords and against eviction   That we may have a right to cut seaware for manure   Power to buy our lands by paying them for twentyfive years or what ever seems proper by trustworthy persons Signed by JOHN MKAY JOHN MLEAN DONALD NICOLSON JOHN CAMPBELL
I have been evicted from Ramasaig to make room for sheep
I was one year a cottar at Ramasaig after some of my fellowcrofters were removed as there was no vacant place for me the first year
I then got the small plot on which I am settled at present only a small plot from which an old widow was evicted to make room for me
It was reluctantly I accepted the offer as the place was far too small for any man who had seven of a family but I had sweet promises and no performance at all The factor Mr Macdonald promised an increase of holding and the privilege of some work about the Hamara farm and herding the cattle
He would do many things for me before I came here as an old man too old for going to other countries to support my family  but I am still obliged to leave my home
Yet old as I am I had Campbell to carry the roof of the old house at Ramasaig the distance of four miles consequently I lost the whole years earning besides my expenses building a new house
As long as I live I shall not get over the loss I sustained by evicting me from Ramasaig
I have spent all I had since I came here
My expenditure in meal corn and seed alone not mentioning any other outlay this same year amounts to  and no income since I came to Hamaravirein but one stirk and one calf
I have to buy the seed to sow the ground and I dont expect to get as much out of it as I have sown
If I had the value of  of land or even the half of it I could manage to keep my family and cattle without being in such a state of poverty
If we dont be relieved through the kindness and sympathy of our sovereign the Queen and Government we shall all be objects of pity and our children will leave us altogether as this place is not fit to keep them anything like human beings unless the land is given to them to till and toil about it
The people do not expect land for nothing they only wish to get as much of it as will support themselves and families at a reasonable rent
They would be quite content if they could stand credit and give every man his due
The people know very well that their forefathers and themselves bought the land before this
W e would all take land for nothing if we could get it but still we dont expect it in that form
We want as much of the land as we can manage to pay and work the same
When I was a cottar at Ramasaig I was compelled to sell my horse by Mr Macdonalds order
The time came that I had great need of the horse when carrying the old house roof and other domestic utensils from Ramasaig I had to get a neighbours horse to help me
Tormore charged me  sterling for my neighbours horse though my neighbour had grazing of his own for the horse JOHN MLEAN
I have not much more to say
I know that Tormore was displeased with me  and I heard it said and I am not going to deny it that I gave hospitality to two individuals who were going about among the people and Tormore threatened that he would do for me because of that
I said to him that I never denied hospitality to any one so long as he would behave himself in my house
He told me I was only keeping a bad house giving lodgment to Irishmen and to blackguards and he ran down both myself and my house and my family
He said I would not give him hospitality and I told him I would and that I was kinder than that towards his business and his servants ever since he came into my neighbourhood
I concur with Mackay in everything he says and Hamara which was cleared by the factor is a trouble to us
It would be better for Glendale that Hamara would be a lake of water than in its present condition
The way our place is so much troubled by our stock wandering to it
There is no fence about it and our stock is suffering on every side of it through his servants keeping the place for himself
Tormores servants who they were there and none of them remained long in the place
MHugh an Irishman and Mr Murdoch was the other
He was a Highlander  he was formerly editor of the 
Highlander newspaper
Yes
They came on the Saturday to the  Glen and reached Meiloveg and they were late and when they returned they came to my house and they left on Monday
Yes
Murdoch went to church
He came to hear the sermon here
The other man could not understand Gaelic and did not go
To enlighten the people on something but I would not understand what he was saying
English
Not many gathered to hear him at any rate
He was telling the public to plead for good justice and to get more land and advising them that they were not to break the law in any way
I think it was to Uist
Yes that is all
Yes and he gave me a call when he returned
He came about six oclock at night and left in the morning
No no other
I dont know what places the man visited
No nothing about it
No
He was saying it was from Glasgow he came to this place
 s d is my rent exclusive of rates
Four cows a horse twenty sheep and the place would not keep half of that
I have the twenty
I have three stirks
The cows happened to have three calves last year
Yes
They are striving to keep that stock which I have mentioned
As I have mentioned four cows one horse and twenty sheep
I must put them off the ground now they are not in the summing
Yes
His summing ought to be the half of mine
Owing to the way in which I work my lot which the factor and the ground officer know the arable part of my lot is double what it was when I got it first and I think I have now six acres of arable land
Thirtyfour years
I could only say that the rise in the rent was very little
Yes
No and they would not be worth anything but for the way in which we feed them
The cows have no milk
I have to feed the stirks with meal which I buy
Yes one of the stirks which I would be able to rear at that time on the grazing of the township would be worth the whole three that I have today reared with the milk of their mothers on the grazing of the township and one cow at that time was better than three today
The land was strong at that time
It was not runout at that time through incessant cultivation
It had been five years in grass when I got it and now it is runout and become so poor that it will not yield either crop or grass to me
Yes
A little more than 
 s
About s
Yes
Another Borrodale man has a share of mine
No not with justice
Seven or eight
Five or six
Five or six
I have not more than that
No that was the summing of my lot
Not to give them justice
I am not a scholar and I could not read a letter but I saw a piece of paper on a board by the road side
I dont know but it was yourself who put it there for all I know and it was by the way side and there was something like that on it but I dont know what was on it
I know the reporters came and took it with them but I dont know what was in the paper
Yes the reporters took it with them
I am not aware nor did I hear of injury being done to any one for such a reason
I dont think that that statement was the opinion or the mind of the people of Colbost or Skiniden
I rather believe it was somebody who did not belong to the place who put it up
I cannot say
They would keep from  to  sheep without any other stock
Yes cattle and goats
It is the best pasturage that belongs to Skiniden
No
MRaild
They were for getting justice but they never said they would not pay their rent
One man paid at events
I do not know but more paid
Yes
No
Yes it would be much under the stock that should be on them
I dont know what are on them
I cannot say
I cannot say anything about it
Yes I was asked especially about the practice of the tenant paying the arrears due by his predecessor
I was codelegate with Donald MLean
No
I have not much to say and I am not going to say much
It is only eleven years since I went to Skiniden and you know that each  township has marches and every lot is the same and the fourth part was taken from the march at Skiniden by the factor who settled it This factor was Norman MRaild and his father had it for  and the poor people are now paying  for it while the fourth part of the land has been taken away from them
MRaild himself
Another thing is that one of the crofters in the place had about half an acre of the best part of his lot taken by MRaild who added it to his own holding while the man is paying still for it
The factor also took from the man the upper part of his lot and gave it to a herd so that the man has only the middle of his lot and he can neither go to the hill nor to the seashore from his lot without trespassing on somebody else unless he goes over the rocks
Again every crofter was promised a ton of seaware
They did not get the half of that and they were under the necessity of buying seaware off MLeod of MLeods property but last year the seaware was ahowed them by Tormore
There is no reason for my saying much
I have seen a great deal of the highhandedness of the landlords and the factors since I remember
Yes they were taken away from the town
That they always formed part of the township till MRaild deprived the township of them
I think it was thirtyfour years ago
Yes
Yes the fourth part of the grazing of the township
I saw them in the possession of Mr Tolmie
Yes plenty
Yes
Yes and it was against my will too
Yes all the township
Not much
We are wanting the burden and the increase of rent that was laid upon us to be taken off
We wrote to the trustees explaining how we were and we got no reply
The piece of land that was put on us
We got the land at its old rent and at the old boundaries from Sir John and when Norman MRaild settled it on us he deprived us of the fifth part of it and when Mr Harry Macdonald Portree became factor in succession to Norman we got summonses of removal from this piece
We got it back with an increase of rent in respect of it of  and besides that there is the increase that was laid upon us for the drainage
The old rent was  when it was occupied by the seven who had it and it is now up to  We were for having our rents reduced to the old amount of  and as to the drainage that was made upon our lands the people got but little for their workd a rood
Two cows and a two yearold
No horse
Six sheep but we keep between eight and nine
 s d besides dues
In  was the first increase and then the drainage money was laid on us about thirty years ago
No
No it was the worse of it  because the work was done so very badly owing to the small pay that was allowed for the work
The land is very much washed away with the heavy rains
No not much
I dont remember
I think Mr MCaskill Talisker went to look at them after they were finished
We did not see
We only saw MCaskill
I am not sure
I mean by that that the factor who was appointed by Sir John Norman MRaildwhen he made lots of the township kept that much for himself
That is visible
No not one
It was the factors house
It was Sir John who built it for MRaild
It is in the family
The MRailds have it yet
There are two storehouses slated
That is all he has
Yes
Yes
No
We did not ask his signature
We did not think that he would be willing to do it
It was the factorMRaildwho informed us that Sir John was going to do this
Yes
He settled the fifth part of the township upon poor people who were not able to pay for it and who portioned it out into small lots and he himself laid the rent upon it
I dont know how he is today
Yes we are in the one township
I am not sure how much he pays
Yes but he has islands belonging to Skiniden which he took possession of at that time and he is keeping his sheep there
No but he keeps two horses
We have no horses at all
I am not sure but we did but even should we make such a representation we would not get a reply as it would be sent back to MRaild
No not since Tormore became factor
It was Tormore who was factor over us since Sir John purchased the property
Norman MRailds son is ground officer
About fortysix or fortyseven
Yes
No
There is another thing I have to bring forward
I had a daughter and others gathering whelks and Norman MRaild gave me a summons of removing because of my daughter gathering a bushel of whelks and when I went to pay the rent to Tormore he exacted from me a payment of s
I am not aware he had any authority other than his own assumption and he used to bo pouring out the whelks which the people gathered on the shore
MRaild had a piece of the shore marked off for himself
Yes and it was the whelks that were gathered there that he poured out
No not now
He has now no authority over us of any consequence
No
I never gathered shellfish but there are some people in our township who are gathering them to help them
Yes
Not in these times at any rate
Sometimes the fishing will be better than at other times
Yes
The owner of each boat cuts out a dock for his boat
No
Yes especially when the steamers would come with goods
No
Yes a quay would be very convenientvery suitable
I came about fortynine years ago
I was sixteen years in this township of Lephin before that
It was when Tolmie got Colbost that we went there
They march at this side
I did not hear the like of that
I was hearing a little about that they were refusing to pay their rent until they would get what they were wanting but I never heard there was such a paper as that
No I would not approve of such
I would not consent to deprive any one of his life for any reason
The lives of people are more valuable in my eyes than that and I am very sorry for the state that they are in just now in every place how we are oppressed by factors and ground officers who have skinned us
A little
Yes they will be shipping off boxes but it is poverty that will be causing them to do that
At this time d per dozen and in winter d when eggs are scarce
I cannot tell
It would not keep them in tobacco
The women get it the men take nothing to do with the like of that
Yes that is so
They cannot do otherwise
They cannot eat their bread dry
They must have something to wash it down and they cannot get anything else
Yes
Yes they are young and their mothers have no milk the cows are so poor that they have no milk at all
Our cows are just like Pharaohs lean kine owing to the inferior nature of the pasture
Not now but when we were settled in Colbost we were promised a ton of seaware but instead of that we were only getting bits that were opposite to our lots and we had to buy the rest
Yes
Twentyone families and two cottars
A good number of them I cannot tell how many
No
That we are packed so closely in the place having so little land and the land through constant cultivation refusing to yield crop aud that we would be better off if we had more of the land so that we could leave some of it out and so cultivate better and that if we dont get extended holdings there will be no justice for us
Some of our people cannot come home to see their families through the poverty of the place having to remain away in the south country earning their subsistence and when they do come home they cannot remain longer than about a month or six weeks and they have to go
If we dout get more land we must needs remain in poverty
Two cows and a twoyearold
Eight sheep is the summing of sheep but we keep ten no horse
From  s to  and 
s besides rates and the increase of my cattle is only one stirk in the year
About fortythree or fortyfour years
No but the dues were increased
It was increased by the dues
We were not at first paying dues but we are now
Yes
No
Eight
It is  s with the taxes
It is  s the present rent I cannot separate the dues from the rent at present
There is no drainage money
There is peat money  s d of peat money
I cannot tell
About three I think
I think I have ten
No some of them are without stock at all
No but very poorly
I cannot tell what stock it would do justice to
Yes plenty land
Bracadale and Minginish the place from which some of them came
Yes and some of our own people to accompany them
No unless one may keep it for a year
They are not allowed to keep a horse
The most of our tillage is done with the caschrom
When we manage to hire a horse we use the plough
From s to s a day
In my fathers time eight had it
Yes that would do
Six cows
About twenty
About 
Yes
I was but young at the time and I cannot tell
About  in my earliest recollection
 some years the prices may not be so good as that
No
That is about the proportion of our yield
About five
Yes about forty barrels
About ten bolls
Yes
Yes a little
About one boll and a half but this year we made nothing
In my fathers time when the township was occupied by eight they were buying neither meal nor potatoes
I could take it but I am not sure if I could pay for it
If I got such a croft I should try to pay for it
No I never gave him the offer but if he happened to be in the place he would just get the offer of it like anybody else
I heard it was the custom in the place to give the first offer to the factor
Yes
It was not Tormore who was doing that
That was said to be the practice on Dr Martins property
No we are far from the seashore
I am not a scholar and I could not read it if I saw it
I am not sure that I heard it at all
I would not mind where I would have to go to if it was only better than where I am
No unless I would shift from where I am
Not until my forefathers went there fortyfive years ago
No but there were eighteen placed there
Nineteen lots or pieces were made of it
Yes at that time
We got more than the half
Yes
Lephin was then under big sheep and a shepherd
Old Captain MacLeod of Orbost
Each one cuts where it is most suitable for himwhere he pleases
Yes and today it is not worth nearly as much as it was worth when we got it
Yes
There is land in Ramasaig and Lowergill and Dibidale and Ollisdale beside them
There is plenty there for Holmasdale but not for all the other townships
Yes
It is kept for sheep
Not for men
No but they were thinking that sheep would pay better than the poor crofters
I dont know what the meaning of it is  but my meaning is that should I improve my lot it would not be in the power of any one to take it from me and to give it to another so long as I would pay for it
I never asked it until today
I never heard them asking for it before until the Commissioners arrived
A year ago
I heard that there were such but I never saw a man
Yes before he came there was talk about it
Yes
I am hearing that some are in his debt but I cannot tell
No
More than a year ago
I cannot tell a great number of years
From every placenorth and south east and west
From  to  s a boll
At Colbost
I dont think so but his salesman was said to be charging Is a boll for his trouble
Yes
It was very useful to the people at all events
Yes
I am instructed to give all such information to the surveyorgeneral when asked as I am provided with books of rules in connection with the postoffice and it is of course unreasonable
This is the report of the people and the report should be forwarded to the proper quarter and then I shall be ready to explain this to the post office department
It is not proper to make such known to the public
That is according as I understand it by the book of rules but I shall be prepared to explain this and to answer this when the report shall be reported to the postmastergeneral and I shall be prepared for my own department
Just so
Yes I have here first my own personal grievances and then I put the account of the people
I wish to read the statement on the part of the people
Yes
Not all some were not at home but to such of my neighbours as were at home all who were living at homebecause the ablebodied people are away
Two
There are only six in my township in Lephin
Yes the rest are away all through the world
As a chosen delegate on behalf of my township I am requested to state a few remarks of their present and past grievances wishing to remind all friends either here or elsewhere of our sending full details of our state to the trustees of the estate
Some time ago being patiently waiting a redress for a long period except that the Meiloveg crofters could hardly bear the yoke placed upon their necks by the interdict of Tormore to which the Supreme Court had given consent in preventing landing or even standing upon any part of the lands between the point of Dibidal and Lower Meiloveg the distance of about twelve miles or taking out any licences or exemption paper for dogs and from handling drift timber under pain of their being reported by shepherds and herds
Under those circumstances of extreme depression it appears that matters changed otherwise when almost all the tenantry of the estate and of Dr Martin preferred hoisting a flag of independence against local rulers at the same time unfurling their Hag of distress for observation of the British Parliament under whose hands are ample stores of provisions so as to grant timely aid to the needy
There are twentynine crofters and four cottars in the townships of Holmasdale and Lephin paying about  rental instead of ten tenants paying rental of  fifty years ago
They are composed of evicted tenants from the parishes of Bracadale and Waternish forty years ago others who had been removed from Meiloveg about fortyfour years ago when under a lease for the late Captain MLeod of Orbost who evicted the old Meiloveg crofters from those townships where they had many privileges in connection with their holdings viz horses sheep moderate rent and double summings of all sorts than at present Holmasdale being the hill pasturage of Lephin where the women used to milk their cattle and sheep as no cattle were then allowed about the clustering hamlets
It was to this desolated uncultivated barren moor the poor forsaken tenants of both Meilovegs had to flee where stones could not be got for erecting huts for themselves and their cattle so that tods might be compared to the ancient Hebrews for want of materials wherewith to form bricks or stones for abodes in their new discovered colony
The rental of both arable land of Lephin including pasturage being formerly  comprising ten shares the former tenants being evicted to make room for sheep about eleven years previous to this new settlement whereas the new settlers of the hill being charged  above the old rent although minus of the arable
Under present depressed conditional circumstances we would humbly pray for relief
Holmasdale and LephinLephin being the proper township
It has been subdivided of late
There is another delegate chosen from Holmasdale
Lephin is the proper township Holmasdale being anciently the pasturage of Lephin and now there is a new name given and the ancient place subdivisioned for some years past
There is another delegate
Oh yes they can show that by a show of hands
Yes
I dont recollect
I read it openly and publicly to the people
Yes
I am a native of Glendale born at Borrodale on the th May  left Glendale at the age of sixteen years enlisted in the Royal Navy on the th January  having passed my examinations as firstclass gunner of the Royal marine artillery at Portsmouth in  and embarked on board HMS Royal George the same year as candidate for actual service for the Baltic having been transferred to HMS
Spiteful in  for the Black Sea Fleet as lance bombardier having been at all engagements from th October  until the end of the Russian war having served also in HMS
Nile and HMS
Sansparcil
I was invalided at Haslar hospital in  through injuries contracted in and by the service with first class certificates of abilities in all branches in which I served including gallantry most exemplary conduct and other honours with pension extended to few vears for reappearance for further examination either for continual service or pension being recommended by the naval medical doctors for retiring to my native land for the benefit of my health
When finding my health and strength improving in my native Glendale and few hundred pounds of money at my command of my hard earnings I wrote a humble petition to the late Sir J
Macpherson MLeod for permission of erecting a shop for general dealings at the roadside at Lephin where I was at the age of half a year old to six years old to which petition a favourable reply was sent through the factor late H
MDonald requiring the approval of the inhabitants of such a shop being for the interest of the locality
Having obtained sufficient signatures to the effect required full permission was favourably granted by the late most honourable proprietor of the Glendale estate
As soon as I started business the factor told me that I would have to become surety for payment of the rent of the croft upon which my house and shop was built or that he would evict its possessor for failing payments ever since he got it as said possessor late Kenneth MKay apparently being possessor two years previously
I conceded to the request rather than see the poor man deprived of his little plot of ground in considering the poor man of being incapable of maintaining either himself or his heavy family of six sons and one daughter who was considered by all his neighbours of being of unsound mind and quite indifferent to all consequences of evictions
I afterwards got possession of the onethird of Hamara and the postoffice on the retirement of the late John Campbell who was first appointed postmaster of the district
The tenants of Hamara were served with summones of removal in  when the whole township of Hamara was relet to me on faith of fixity of tenure as long as I would pay the rent for same
I was again served with citation of ejectment from the township of Hamara in the spring of  when having a long debating regarding the agreements made with the factor that I should not be removed without cause or nonpayment c
The only plea the factor offered was that he wanted the township of Hamara for his own accommodation and that he would allow me the sole use of the lot at Lephin as he was under a vow of depriving MKay of his last and only cow for payment of meal and as there were so many applicants for said No  lot of Lephin he was about letting it to some one named Donald Nicolson Glasphin who offered to build a new house upon it as he would not think of removing me out of my own premises since his being aware of my getting full authority from the proprietor of budding premises for the interest of tenants and proprietor as postmaster and general dealer
I continued paying my rent as formerly until  when having many charges against Tormore on account of bad neighbouring and for many losses of illusage of my sheep and cattle in his protecting the township of Hamara by dogs instead of the customary dykes as anciently kept in repair when good neighbouring and fair play being naturally expected from crofters and proprietors
He then charged me of being repeatedly claiming justice from him and if he were in my place that he would knock his head against the stones
I told him of his foolish redress and unsound advice as a magistrate and meditator between tenants and most esteemed proprietors
He reminded me of my not paying the arrears of the former tenant amounting to   s two years rent
I told him of my never hearing of such contract being mentioned in our specification until then and if such an amount were owing to the landlord it looked quite careless to him as manager allowing two cows worth  be taken away by two dealers from off said property until the honest proprietor would have his own and that I might justly charge him fully  for his interferences and noninterferences as a sole judge and ruler of all matters on the estate for a period of about twenty years
I there and then paid my rent and left the paying office of Hamara lodge having pocketed my receipt and proceeded homewards and after arriving home I discovered that I had been fairly or rather unfairly cheated by my perusing my rent receipt found myself as heir of the heirs of the estate of Kenneth MKay being watching and waiting consequences ever since then until I had the pleasure of acknowledging per receipt a registered letter on the th of April last and finding enclosures quite unjustly and quite contrary to reason which might easily be proven by original rent receipts and hereby declare my having paid quite regularly my diverse dues as sole possessor of No  lot at Lephin ever since  to  and that my father paid said lands at or within a few yards of same stance from  to  making clear payments of twentysix years besides the unsettled period of two years for which I offered payment to the present factor on terms of my being fairly served with proper coefficient receipt as formerly so as to correspond with former settlements
I have so far endeavoured showing my having been served with three summons of removal within the last twenty years without any reasonable cause except imaginary and unfair accusations of the following natures
Yes the hill pasture belonging to Lephin
There was no township at Holmasdale before
Yes
Twentynine families between the two
Twentyone nineteen paying rent and two cottars
About fortyfour years ago
They came nearly all at once
From Upper Meiloveg
The most part of them about eighteen of them I believe
Yes
For the purpose of making room for sheep
The land of the Upper Meiloveg
No it is still under tenants
It is the tenants or crofters of the Upper Meiloveg
They were removed at this time to make room for sheep and afterwards it was lotted again and the same place is under crofters
Yes
Yes
It is supposed to be six but there are nine families including the cottars
Yes
There is one croft subdivided and another cottar who pays s
It is supposed to keep ten sheep and two cows and a stirk no horse
From  s to about 
I am paying generally  s but since I left off paying I dont know what it is
It is going up and down
Yes
No
No
A great deal it is worth twice as much as it was when I got possession
Draining and trenching
No
I never attempted taking any part without bounds of law but I say I have been accused of such
Yes I have been threatened
By my factor Tormore
He said that if I should go against him I was sure to go against all his equals or my superiors and gentlemen throughout Skye because I would not side with him in all his opinions
He would become my enemy of course
He would look after me with his enmity
Of course I have been served with summonses of removal as stated in my statement with three summonses within the past twenty years
I was served with the last on the th of April this year
Yes
About fifteen years ago I had one and about seventeen years ago
I always left that to himself
I was paying my way at the time I was served with these summonses
I am past that
I cannot say
No there is no use of defending a person because I have not got the money
There was no use going to defend it unless I got the means so I kept my house instead of defending myself
Yes
Of course not
Of course they might
I have been serving others who called for their own
Yes in two years arrears
On the th April last I opened the letter but it seemed the letters had come to the postoffice on the th but I had not time to look intoall my letters that day there were so many of them
I never told any one
I shall explain this to his Lordship afterwards in connection with the postoffice
Yes in reference to the letter which has been given in by Cameron
It states  I got a letter from the factor to come to an arrangement and he told me to be humble under the hand of oppression as the laird did not care a straw should Scott put every living soul of us out into the sea
Either I or my father was the factor at that timeI do not know which
I beg most distinctly to repudiate the whole thing as a gross calumny upon MLeod of MLeod and upon myself also
I know MLeod takes the greatest interest in his tenantry and would like to act well to them
I have now been connected with the land for about twenty years and I think I have only seen two evictions during that time both for misbehaviour or alleged misbehaviourone being the man Donald Nicolson whom I have seen in the papers called a  brave old crofter and another an old woman who was also petitioned against by her neighbours from the Skeabost estate
As to this man Cameron I believe Mr Scott never intended actually to evict him but simply to teach him to fulfil his obligation j and I know I used my influence if it was necessary to make things smooth between Cameron and Mr Scott but even that I think was scarcely necessary for I know Mr Scott to be a most kind considerate and just man and well known to be so through the whole of Skye
I may have written himI dont remember but I know I did not write to the effect that has been alleged
Yes I had and I know my influence was used to try and get him to agree with Mr Scott
Personally I am  very much against evicting tenants forcibly
I have rather committed an error in allowing too many people to settle on the land rather than evict them
That is the chief error I have committed
 did
There was an ordinary summons of removal because this man would not fulfil his obligations to Mr Scott and he came to me and I tried over and over again to smooth matters and I could produce a long correspondence to show that my mind was entirely against evicting him
As a man and a law agent and factorin every way
Yes or ever entertaining any such sentiment or MLeod either
I have no particular statement to make but I am ready to answer any questions
Six years in January last
Yes
Yes I do
I ascribe their poverty primarily to the smallness of their holdings
I believe they will be better off if they have larger holdings
No
I am a native of North Uist
Well I cannot say in reference to this parish
Not in my native parish
I think they are as well off there as they used to be
I cannot say anything except for the past six years with reference to the people here but I think the want of milk is a very great want in this parish and is felt severely
I think it is a very great hardship to rear children without milk
Decidedly they do
I believe many would
A great deal
All the young people leave early in spring at least as soon as they are done with their tillage
They go south and earn wages there and send a great deal of money to support their parents and friends at home
Yes I think so
I think they are both very indifferent about the circumstances of the people in this parish both the factors and the proprietor they are distant
No
Yes they are very poorly clad and that interferes very much with their education
Whenever we find fault with parents for not sending their children forward to school the reason they assign for their absence is that they cannot keep them clad that they have not shoes and that if the weather is anything severe they cannot send them on to school
There is a great deal of truth in it
There is an inspector appointed in the parish to look after them and there is a parish doctor
I think they do so far as I know
I hear no complaints
It is very seldom I see any one before the board with any serious complaints in reference to the administration of the poor law in the parish
They are the most liberal board in Skye I believe
This year of course people are hard pressed but that is general all over Skye and for that part all over the west coast
Yes they have
Yes they got a little and we have a surplusI mean the parochial committeeto relieve the poorest in the shape of meal through the summer for perhaps the real pinch is scarcely on yet
We kept a reserve fund
Remarkably so
I dont think there have been two criminal cases in the whole parish since I became minister of it
I have been once there visiting the school as a member of the school board and I beg to say in the absence of my friend the Free Church minister that Soay is not neglected to such an extent as MCaskill said
There is a catechist resident always in the island and it is very seldom the island is without the services of a missionary and very often a licentiate of the Free Church I may say the whole of the people in the island are Free Churchmen
Well the soil is very poor it is a very poor island
Well in former years baptism was neglected
There were two adult individuals belonging to the island of Soay that I baptised
No but they come here
In reference to the election of delegates it was simply this that four or five individuals cottars from the township of Cuilore called on me and asked me to preside at their meeting
I told them first of all it was a very simple thing and that I thought they were quite capable of selecting delegates themselves
I then drew up a paper for them calling a meeting which two or three of them signed
At the same time I declined to preside at the meeting because I was under the impression that there was another gentleman in the parish who would be far more acceptable to the parish in general It was not at all owing to being ashamed or afraid to attend for it was a lawful meeting but I was under the impression that another gentleman would be got whose presidency would be more acceptable to the peopleI mean Mx Ross
It was all owing to a misunderstanding
At Carabost
That would depend on the weather 
A boat could do it in two or two and a half hours but it is a very long route by the road
It would take three and a half hours from Ose to Carabost
I think it is the most central place now
No
There are two
One was sent two or three years ago and the other recently
No I think it is a superfluity
I think we could do very well without them
Not so far as I know
I have never heard a complaint
 I was summoned before the Sheriff for disobedience in not keeping a maid servant for Mr Scott the sheep farmer
Wages for summer d and d per day which would not keep soul and body together
I got a letter from the factor to come to an arrangement and he told me to be humble under the hand of oppression as the laird did not care a straw should Mr Scott put every living soul of us out in the sea
I then had to submit under the yoke and had to pay an extra pound all round and a year last spring at the last account then I was able to pay the last of the tithe
I got a letter from Scott that my  brother and sister were not allowed to cut the peats till forced to yield I sent this note to the proprietor telling him Scotts demand was reasonable
I then went to Dunvegan and laid my grievance to him but no remedy
That was the way at first but as I was not performing the service I had to pay  more
But this extra payment ceased a year last spring
I believe not more than fifty days
I was not aware of anything of the sort
We were paying the rent for the place and when a person could get home to do the work we sent that person
It was I myself who was doing the work all along but he was at me to get a woman servant to do the womans work on the farm
No and therefore this extra money was laid upon me till it was taken off last year
Not when it began with me
I had a sister but she got married
It was after my sister married that it began
Yes she would be giving days work like any other person in the village but should I get a servant to work all she would get to do would not keep her in food for three months
No
The rent was reasonable and I was paying it
Yes my cause of complaint ceased last year but he has taken a good deal of money off me because of it
It is a case with several others in my township as well as myself
Yes
Yes
Yes I have to say in the first place that I could not put down either potatoes or oats in my ground this year as the ground is so softnothing but peats and bogs and I could not get back what I put into it
I am for the past twenty years getting ground from others in which to plant my potatoes and sow my oats and my father was for thirtyfive years the same way
I have no place on which to build a house
My present house is built on the township and the tide rises to it and every stormy night that comes I have to watch and put out all the furnituresuch as it is
A sister of mine was employed one night last winter putting out the furniture and she was sickly and she died in consequence of hurting herself that night
I tried with carrying some peat soil on my back to make up soil on my ground but it defied me
I have to pave a way for my cow with stones through my lot in order to get out to the hill otherwise she would get drowned
She would never have got her feet out of the ground it is so soft
I do not think I have anything more to say
I have been through England Scotland Ireland and France and I have not seen such an awful place for people to be living in as Soay
Yes a yachtsman
Yes
We take our meal from Broadford and it costs s a bag to the Loch Slapin and from there we have eighteen miles by boat to Soay  and it may happen I have to spend s to  for lodgings in going for this meal should bad weather come and those at home may be starving
No person can believe the sort of place it is unless he has seen it
I dont remember I asked him for a place to build a house in but a brother of mine asked him for a stance to build a house and he built a house near my place and the tide destroyed it and he died himself
Yes
Yes
No
Boats which we get home from the south
A boat which belonged to me was destroyed by the last storm and I applied for relief to the distributors of the fund that was collected for repairing the fishermens boats and I was refused
I was obliged to get another boat instead
Yes
Mr Macdonald factor Portree Mr Cameron Talisker Mr Cameron Glenbrittle and the minister of Bracadale
Not quite
Yes
No  some blacksmiths and tradesmen got part of that money and I got none I who was making my living by fishing
No
No our herring fishing is gone
We have no nets
No nothing to speak of
We were fishing lobsters
Middling
About three months
Sometimes from s to ss when they are plentiful and s when they are not
Yes
We ourselves take them to Loch Slapin and pay a cart to take them thence to Broadford
Sometimes s a bag
About four
Two spring tides
There are no whelks now
Yes among the rest
There are four or five of us
Yes  my grandfather went to the armyat least he was forced to goand his bones are bleaching on a West Indian island
My father served in the militia as long as there was service
My brothers served about fifteen years in HM
Navy and now the grandson is evicted to a rock or island that is not inhabited
They are paying  for the croft and the grazing of a cow
At first the agreement was that we were to have four milk goats and followers
Four milk goats and one cow
We had ten sheep and a horse but no horse can stand upon it

The next farmer that came began to reduce us
He took the sheep altogether
Hugh
MAskill
He was taking them in by degrees
He had a battle about taking them because we were not willing to let them go
Not a farthing
He raised the rent upon us another pound and summoned my father for being disobedient because he would not sign this agreement
He took him before the sheriff
Well we were that way till he died
Then the present master came He reduced that  of rent
Mr Cameron of Glenbrittle
Then next year going on at that rate I went over to see Mr Cameron about the accounting if there was anything due and instead of the 
was charged  again
I am paying  also  for the grazing of a cow
Yes I said I would not do it as long as the sun shines upon me
My order was  you will be evicted
So when the proper time came I went over to appear before the sheriff and I met Mr Cameron
Well Mr Cameron told me to return and that he would reduce the rents that it was his managers fault that did it  but I said why in the name of Heaven was my brother that was incurable for twentyfive years evicted and my sister was attending upon him unless it was that he was asking some relief from the parochial board
Glenbrittle told me it was the factor in Taliskers establishment that did that as he would not go to that royal establishment for the poor
Yes
He was incurable for twentyfive years
Yes and I kept him all since that time
I arranged to stop it then
It went no further and we are that way still
There are twentythree families on the island
In the time of the former proprietorRhuthere were two crofts
I forgot to say that Mr Cameron made his cottar build his house on my croft for five years and all the crop that grew on it during that time was s worth
He had two cows and a sheep and a lot of poultry and it would take a good man to keep them out
Yes he has his fathers croft now
Some of them are bogs and rocks heather and fern that is all
There are portions of it where if I would throw a pail of seaware off my back you would suppose you were standing at the foot of Mount Etnait would shake as long as there was bog to shake
Baron Rothschilds money could not drain it
To remove the inhabitants out of the island altogether
I would take  acres of a farm at the same rent as the present factor is paying for it stock it and build a house
No it is quite impossible
I mean I would take a farm on the mainland
Do the same with those who were able to take it and let the rest die
There is no relief for them unless they go to the poorhouse
They will die on the island
We live by fishing
Every cent we get is by fishing and by the sea
There is a creek but the entrance is dry at low water
It is not good for ling but for herring
There is a bay on the south side if there was a pier there but this wee harbour that is in it might be cleared and made a fine harbour for boats
There is not a word but that
I would have  acres of a farm at the present rent that is paid
I suppose it is not paying above Is per acre
I would have  or  acres
Any of the farmsI dont care which but let me get arable land where I will get to that croft from the sea with my boat
They tell me that our former minister said he saw oat crop growing in Glen Bracadale and that he never saw better growing in the Lothians
Just outside where you are standing and down the farm here
That is what I was told
Every one who can take that measure let them take it because there are a lot willing to do it
I dont know  I never asked them
I know their circumstances
I know they were for a fortnight this year living on shellfish and I know there were three families whose only subsistence for a week was the carcass of a stirk that died
Surely but if they would get  acres and pay  for it it would do them well and let them get fixity and tenure so that no landlord or factor could put them outonly Her Majesty
No but where they are going
I dont know
I dont suppose the landlord would be a whit the worse of the poor crofters having  or  acres than he has by giving it to big sheep farmers
That is my opinion and a good opinion too
Just give it to one that is able to take it
The proprietor
He is bound to take the stock
Sell them
We will do the best ourselves
That is my own secret
With regard to my croft I cannot take the wintering of a cow upon it
There is not a blade of grass growing there and it is so soft I must put seamanure upon it
There is not a blade that a scythe could reach without that
When I sow a bushel of oats it would not be difficult to count how many blades would come out of it
The man that was there before laid them on my crop and in spite of my neck he just plundered my crop with sheep
There are about  or  hoggs wintering off my lot
It would not in the least because there is no possibility of keeping cattle when you cannot grow corn
It would pay a sheep farmer very well to have the grazing of it
We want to be removed
I have been there in and out since I was born
It is ourselves that went first into it before there was a wholesale eviction by MCaskill of Rhu
He took three or four of my grandfathers and granduncles and smuggled them away
Whoever would not pay   to him he would leave them helpless
There was only a herd so far as I know
Exactly
It was not good enough for sheep
I want to have nothing to do with the island
What would he herd
It could not afford sustenance for all the families
I would not care although they should remove it into the sea
If I would open my mouth I would be sure to have my teeth drawn
After I did a years work for the other man he would pay me with a boll of meal and a pound  and he told the proprietor to give us meal and when I went I had to pay  Os for a brother of mine who had got a boll of meal and was dead on his croft
Worse every day
No we knew well enough it was of no avail and unless Her Majesty will do it he will not do it
I am certain sure of it as sure as I have to meet my death
Yes
There was an old church over at the island which was destroyed
We took a piece of the old pulpit and one or two pews
The proprietor belonged to the Established Church and he sent us to Portree
I went there lost two days and was sent to Edinburgh and the authorities there were so kind to us that we were not out of lodgings till we came home
Yes
Not one
We did not see a minister these five months back
Bracadale
Yes
Yes or give us the  Lively and we will go
Yes
Yes
Carabost and the nearest postoffice is at Carabost
Yes
Yes
At Carabost
He was two or three times this year at us but I daresay it was two or three years before he was there before
I know it well
It is seventy years ago since my grandfather went and it was before that
They took them away in spite of themselves
No it was to Charlestown where they were sold for slaves
He left them poor enough and robbed the clothes off their backs before they came back to the same farm again
Old Kenneth MAskill
Yes
Ive heard news from people who went to America
Many of them say they would rather be home in their native place yet if they were the way they were before
About one hundred
I cannot say
It will be twelve miles in circumference with creeks and all and it is nearly cut in sunder and there is not  yards of breadth altogether in the centre
I just keep soul and body together with my own labour at fishing
I was for twenty years roaming about at sea and I have had to stay at home to keep my aged parents out of the poorhouse
That is what kept me on that barren island
That I am
But to get it to that extent and at that rate and fixity of tenureno eviction
Yes
May I not tell what happened to the people that were put out of these places
Yes
five in Glenmore six in Glen Colbost
I do not remember how many families were in the third glenGlen MCaskill When Gibbons took the place he put away the tenants out of the glens
They were in very comfortable circumstances with cattle and sheep and horses
He sent them away at the term of Whitsunday
He then sent eight families out of Garamore and Ebost
There were plenty people at that time at Ebost and Ulinish
He sent five of the remaining families to a wet black place called Garamore which had not been inhabited before
Of those who were in Ulinish he sent twenty families to Struanmore
He there gave them the corner of a piece of ground plotted out among them all and none of them had a cow but one
He was a merchant
That was in  They are there cultivating that ground every year for the past forty years
He left three or four neighbours
My father was one of them and these were not at all the best off
He compeUed them to give him four days work cutting peats each year and for which he was giving them a lippie of meal
Mr Gibbons was fifteen years in possession of the place
Then his lease expired and he left the tack with Mr Norris his nephew
I was living in Ulinish and he was not better than Gibbons
If a son married in a mans family the father dared not give him shelter for a night
All the young men that we had must needs leave and go to the cities and every one who married in this way would have to leave
The tenants when they became old were becoming poorer till they came to be on the poor list as their children were not allowed to remain with them
After Norris there was another farmer Mr Simpson a brotherinlaw of Mr Norris who took up the farm
He was not a residenter
He had a manager on the farm and that manager was the worst that ever came to us
He was treating the people very badly
He was ten years in the place
I should have told that five other families went to Australia of their own free will to try and better their circumstances
Mr Robert Macdonald took the farm after Mr Simpson
Mr Macdonald raised the wages of the people to s and some to s d per day
It is twelve years since he came into the farm and he ramained in possession eleven years when he died
Now as we had been reduced to such poverty during all that time we sent last year a petition to the landlord asking him to give us land or better justice than we had experienced
We got a reply through the factor that we were to get something but we did not get what we requested
He enlarged our holdings a little more and he gave leave to every one of us who had not a cow to get one
This enabled every one who had not a cow to get one
The factor also put a fence between us and him
The place is very confined for all the stock that is on it
We have eighteen cows
Ullinish is now in possession of the landlord and managed by the factor for him
We are now holding under the landlord himself
I have no more to say
Eighteen families
One cow
We have no grazing outside of our lots for the cows
It will only enable us to keep that cow
We have but one cow
 s besides rates
Yes
About three acres now
Yes
No
Not altogether yet
They have not all got them yet
I cannot say
I believe there are some of them that cannot easily get a cow
They were so long in poverty
Yes they must
It is only last Martinmas we got an addition to our holdings
No
We did not state how much but we had a meeting among ourselves and we were thinking of asking him for twelve acres a piece but we did not ask him that yet
Yes
We would need four or five cows and from twenty to thirty sheep
We are for honest honourable people other than ourselves to come and fix a fair rent
Yes
Plenty both hill pasture and arable land
Yes
I believe they would not be able at first
I was thinking we would do our best and if we got money by which we could drain and improve our land we would then be able to stock it
Should we not be able to do it at once we could do it gradually
We spend in meal annually as much as would pay the rent when nothing at all is growing in our ground except a little potatoes
It is twenty years since the mill up here ground a boll of meal and that shows the poverty of the people
We would prefer a lease so that we might not be put away for any reason but nonpayment of rent for without a lease they could put us away when they pleased
Fifteen years is a common period for leases in this part of the country
I would
I am growing old and getting old at any rate
No
Any one who travels and goes the road can see there is plenty of land and for double the number of people
No we would need to put a house on each of our crofts
Yes
Yes but it would not be slated houses
No a piece that the factor set apart by guess
It would not be as large as it is but it would make a good tack still
Yes
Yes
Yes I mean by a lease of fifteen or twenty years fixity of tenure
Yes
Yes
Yes so far as I know but I was not acquainted with the state of matters on the other side of the loch
Yes
Yes
Yes
There might be one or two absent but there were others besides Struanmore people present
About a week or a fortnight before the Commissioners came to Braes
The papers came down telling us the Commissioners were coming
Yes
Mr Ross the minister told us
We sent word to the two ministers to come and take charge of the meeting
Neither of them came
No
I was not aware
I was not present at any rate
Yes
Ose and Balmeanach
Three or four families
They were shifted to another part of it
They were made to build their houses on peat soil beside the river and when the river was in flood some of them had to leave their houses for fear of their tumbling upon them
Yes
The Balmeanach crofters had been removed before my time
I only saw two cottars there
I dont remember having heard how many families were in Balmeanach
Yes
Yes  many up in the glens and by the seashore
There was a small township in Balmeanach called Grauban and there were tenants there also and there were tenants also in Shagary
I did not see the tenants but I was told of it
I cannot tell
I did not hear
These townships were part of Balmeanach
For the tacksman Mr Stephen a lowlander
Ose and Balmeanach were two tacks before then but both as well as Glen MCaskill and Glen Ulinish were made into tack for Mr Stephen
I do not know any more townships in that place
There were a few in Balgown
These were not sent away at all
One or two left of their own free will and the others died out
None of the old people that I remember are there today
All the people of who I have told that were removed by Mr Gibbons were sent to Glendale
The crofters were sent to Ramasaig and Lowergill and those who were removed from Garamore and Ebost were sent to Meilove
Nineteen families out of the tack of Ulinish
A few are still alive but their descendants are to the fore still
Yes I heard that the Garamore people requested the landlord to be removed from their present place at Garamore and they were refused but the people were here today I believe and they will tell
There is a man hereMalcolm MLeodwho was one of them
No
To Mr Butters Sligachan who has got the inn here
The man who had the inn before Norman MLeod
That is the first man I saw in possession and in my fathers time it was in possession of Dr MCaskill
Cuilore
Yes indeed and bad land
There is no great fishing for our families for the past few years
No herring comes into it
A week or a fortnight before the arrival of the Commissioners at the Braes
Yes
Yes
Two cows and a horse
Some of them had it
No none of them less than one
Yes at Ulinish the same
Yes they had some sheep but I dont mind about them
Yes Alexander Macdiarmid
They got no milk at all
Yes
Yes I recollect we had a meeting first ourselves and then we had another meeting last week
Mr Mackenzie
Yes
Not the first day
Yes
Yes
I know that what our young people are wanting is that they are not to be liable to be  removed at all as long as they pay their rent
No doubt it would give us more encouragement
That would be the fairest way with us but there is no saying but the rent might rise to be too high
We would be pleased enough with that
I think that all in our district would be willing to avail themselves of such terms
Yes where the heather and ferns are growing now plenty of good arable land
Yes I have seen that
It is too much what we pay for a cows grazing here but in crofters townships they only charge from s to  for a cows grass for a year
Exclusive of wintering but I am not sufficiently well acquainted with crofters townships
If a man had a good croft he would have enough wintering for a cow
I have a small bit of  land
Yes
I have to complain of their poverty and the miserable houses that they have
The families till they are grown up have to sleep in the same room
It is a sheer violation of human nature
Our meal mill has gone to ruin and for the past twenty years there has not been a peck of meal ground in it
I remember being with my father waiting for a whole week to get my turn at the mil
That was before the first potato blight
It is the prevalent opinion that we were grinding between  and  bolls annually in this parish previous to the first potato blight
Previous to
They are none of them better anywhere
I think they are
Most of them are very bad
Yes
Mostly about the same price
The average is d for good crystallised sugar
I manage to make both ends meet
Yes a lot of them but they cannot help it
As a rule the cottars are as honest a people as are under the canopy of heaven if they could be so
Yes if they had the means
They are sinking more in debt
As a rule tea and sugar as they have no meal
Most of them have no meal and that is the only thing they have to put down their morsel of bread
Yes
Yes
Just a very small quantity and I very seldom sell bacon or cheese but I keep a little
A lot of the money comes from the market towns Glasgow and Greenock and from manufacturing towns and from people going to Mathieson fishing and earning money
There is no money to be earned in Skye
No there are very few tourists come this length
Only what I heard
I heard about the evictions by Dr MLean and Taliskerthat was called the Reign of Terror
I heard so but I cannot mention particulars
There is a delegate here
Yes
That is all I dont mind of any except what what was mentioned
I was for some time absent from the country
Very very poor
There are ten or twelve families
Double that number
There were no evictions after that but evictions before that
The people flitted out of it after the potato blight
Yes about Carabost
Yes and the smallness of the crofts
Upwards of forty years ago
Yes
That was before that
Some of them
Yes
Yes and a lot of them emigrated to Australia at the time of the famine
Yes
Yes and a lot went to Glasgow and Greenock and a great deal of them to the market towns
Oh they raise no crop at all
Yes
Yes
Yes I dont know of any of them being turned out
A lot of remarks were made about John MCaskill but I was absent from the country at the time
Far too small
Yes they would very soon improve them if they had the means
That is so
No for I improved my own and I am not afraid of being turned out
No more than I have of this church
No I dont think so
No I dont think it
Their own neighbour may take a set of it to give more money for it
Never in my life
Not that I am aware of
Never to my knowledge and I never heard anything about it
Cottars
No crofters on our side of the loch at all
Yes
There are about half a dozen of the people employed in it altogether
No but at the time of its erection they were complaining bitterly of it
They were turned out wholesale by the distilleryto make the distillery
Not a gill
No it is too dear
From the market townfrom Greenock or Glasgow
Not that I ever heard of except only a few men to get employment about it
There is one of them in it ever since it was erected
There are strangers and natives in it both
There was some little grievance of that kind at the time of the Disruption
Well it cooled down
Yes for a couple of years
Yes I remember it myself
It was the late Hugh MAskill and Donald MAskill of Rhu Dunan
The landlord was not blamed for it so far as I know
No
Not that I am aware of
It has cooled down long ago
Yes
By their own free will entirely
I heard there were sixteen families at one time in Crackinish and there is nobody there now but the shepherd
There were ten or twelve in Glenbrittle
There were twenty or more families in Rhu
In Saatran there were four or five families and there would be about six families between Trean and Mercadale
There would be six to ten families in Borlin and in Grid so far as I have been able to ascertain there were not more than four or five families and four or five in Braceinart
I think that includes the whole of the tack of Rhu
When Hugh MAskill succeeded the doctor he got Talisker and the places that were cleared by Dr MLean and he was barely settled when he commenced the same operations himself
Ferrinlea was a big township occupied by thirty families when he got it
They were scattered through the world by the same person
A family was in Borlin called MLeod
The MLeod family commenced the clearances and MAskill finished them
There were two Fiskavegs and two Ardhoils
The families occupying these have been given already
There was another township called Carbostbeg near Ferrinlea
There were four families there very well off and the daughter of a widow who was living there told me that her father gave Hugh MAskill when he came to Talisker  to help him and MAskdl put the widow out of the place after that
He cleared Carbostbeg for himself for the purpose of erecting a distillery in Carbost
The same widows daughter told me she saw her fathers corn shovelled out into the river when seeking a place for the distillery
No as I said what the Assyrians left undone the Babylonians finished
Yes
Those whom I named before are dead and I want now to speak about the living
I will begin with Mr Cameron Talisker as he succeeded MAskill
The present tacksman
He got the tack thirtythree years ago and when he came on he made up his mind that there should be nobody in the place at all for MAskill had left remaining some of the people for his own convenience When Mr Cameron came to Talisker he was not to do with any of the people and as I have understood he began to litigate with the landlord holding out that the people being allowed on the tack was not mentioned in the lease
For five years he would have nothing to do with this
He would give us nothing and he would keep nothing from us
The matter then came that he would have to take the tack as he got it or leave it and he stuck to it He then deprived the cottars of the grazing which they had and grazing for cows could no longer be got not for twenty years or so
He took from us our peat mosses and gave us a bog which neither man nor beast made use of up to that time
For peat moss and that was measured out to us by the yard a lot for each family
In Fiskaveg where cottars had been left by MAskill also they were deprived of their peat mosses
There was bad land near their houses which could not be called earth or moss and the poor people had to cut their soil as it was to make fuel of
Then he removed ten cottar families which had been left by MAskill in Cortenanshiarich and before them there were ten to twelve families in Ferrinlea and he made places for the Cortenanshiarich families on the land which these ten or twelve families had in Ferrinlea before them
He deprived the township of Ferrinlea also of a piece of land for the accommodation of his shepherd
Then he took ten or eleven families from Fiskaveg and another township and put them into Ferrinlea also and again divided the existing holdings to make room for them
We were under the necessity of attending to the tacksman of Talisker on any day he would require us to work  and when paying us a strong man should he be as strong as Samson would only get Is a day and our women d a day and do the work according to where the work wasnine or ten milesbesides doing the work whatever we would be atI have an instance myself in my own casewhatever we were at for we had to support ourselves
I myself am a shoemaker having learned the trade and my brother also and we would have to leave our work and attend to the tacksmans work
We who are engaged in trade sometimes get credit to the extent of  for our trade purposes and we would be losing our business for the sake of doing Taliskers work at Is a day
He commenced to complain of us as a family when I would not work and my brother would not and that was the same thing
He commenced to complain of the manner in which we were working
We were attending to our work
My mother was the head of our family
She is a widow and we were working for her and supporting her
I am the eldest of the boys and the very day he was complaining of the inefficiency of the work my brother was working for him
He commenced to complain and I understood it would not be easy to satisfy him in any way
I said to him I could not stop my work for him entirely and that I would pay him the equivalent of our work according to the rate of wages in the country and because I had the boldness to say that to himto shorten my story my mother and myself were served with a summons of removal
There was nothing now for it but that I should either apologise to the tacksman and sign the paper that I would be obedient to him at any time or I would leave the country with the whole of our family
About seventyfive
When my brother saw what was likely to be he went to Talisker to make the peace and he said he would go in for the land and to let the matter pass by
We have been allowed to remain on that footing
No but I sell a little groceries
Yes
About twenty years now
I began shoemaker twenty years ago
About nine or ten years ago I commenced to sell  groceries
Yes and by the good opinion which the merchants from whom I was getting my goods had of me
Middling good
It is built with stone and lime now
Yes
As a family we are diligent
We can employ ourselves on sea as well as land
There are three brothers of us and every one is helping the family yet
Yes in the course of providence but little thanks to Talisker or anything we were getting from him
Yes it is with money and that that they are paying for the shoes but money earned in many waysearned by fishing and work outside the countrysailors over the whole world
Yes six months I myself am getting that
Yes many of them are sunk in debt to an extent that they can never pay
Not in my township
Yes
Alexander Mathieson and Catherine MCaskill postmistressshe began this year to keep a few groceries
That is all I know
There is another girl named Cameronshe keeps little groceries but these are all
I cannot say about their circumstances
Alexander Mathiesons circumstances appear to be as good as mine
Three shillings
No
No that is the common price
Three shillings
s a boll lb per stone
s in general and s for womens shoes
s and s for womens boots
I cannot say
I am more afraid when the time for my own payment comes that I will have to borrow the money
As I was hearing from the people of the place
No
No
No
No but Mr Cameron of Talisker told me that the landlord had blamed him for his usage of the people
I can say with regard to the first clearances that were it not for MLeods interference there would not be a representative alive of the families of the original inhabitants of the district to bear testimony today
Yes that was what caused the dispute
Yes
His plan is that he divides the townships into districts and he requires the people so many from the one district today and so many from the other the next day
Field work
Yes at all times when the work is there to be performed
He ceased to make up accounts with us the last few years and I do not remember the number of days the work would amount to
Three days a week by dividing the people into two companies and calling upon the one upon each alternate day
In spring and summer and harvestwhile field work is being done
Twentythree or twentyfour families and three families in Glen Einart
Twenty families
Yes
A park which was in the township
It was part of the land they held before
Before twenty families were cleared the township had sheep and cattle and hill pasture but afterwards they were reduced to one cow but some had two
Yes
We got the grazing of one cow back a few years ago
No they have only between them seven cows
There were some of those who had not cows who were refused to be allowed to keep them
Yes and some were refused
We pay a fixed sum for the cows grass of 
Yes and that for the cows outfeeding
We have to winter the cow besides
Yes
The croft is two acres and a chain and we are charged  for that and we were paying that  with our work if our work amounted to as much and if not we had to make up the balance in money
A few years ago he ceased making accounts with us for the land but we have to attendto his work any time he wants us
We give work in the name of rent for our croft
We have to take into account that very often the women would be working
When we were making up accounts it often happened that we would have to pay money to him but when settling for the cows grazing we have often got s the balance of the price of our stirks as he himself bought our stirks
A year
Sometimes  s we got that last year
We never refused them as he was in the way of buying them
We cannot be sure
Buyers were not coming our way
I dont think we have
Yes
When we had a servant we would be sending her
No j when there was mans work to be done one of ourselves had to go
Yes
Yes
Yes  every township is
I may say the whole parish of Bracadale is one sheep tack altogether and at one time it was supporting a population of  before the clearances commenced
I have no doubt you believe that to be true but the largest population of Bracadale was in  when it was  from which it has fallen to
Yes I want land also
If the land had been left which our forefathers had there would have been no occasion to ask that of us today
The stock would have descended to us
I will tell you this and it is the mind of the people that I speak  if we would get the land at a reasonable rent and what we call fixity of tenure we would get plenty who have money to assist us in stocking that land
In whatever way we would get it I do not know what would be the best way but we would get it
It has seven or eight years to run yet
That is not easy for me to tell
That is the practice that is going
Yes since the death of the last tacksman and the lease being expired also
We in our place are so much distressed with  removings that it is hardly easy for people to make flittings who are sunk in poverty
And perhaps even after they had flitted to Ullinish they might in a short time be evicted to make room for sheep again
Yes there is land enough about us near us and we are not as a people able to leave and to build new houses
We are tired of that work and we dont know what time we may be turned out
That is a sufficient reason
He comes generally every autumn
Yes he will be speaking to those who are near himself but we dont go near him at any time
Yes
 In the year  I along with seven other families was removed from the township of Ferrindonald
These families were scattered throughout the parish for the sake of putting the township into one farm and at the time of clearing it the first man who occupied it as a farm was one of Lord Macdonalds servants
This man who first occupied the farm never possessed lands on the Macdonald estates nor elsewhere and I can honestly state that I had my rents paid to the time of being removed not being a farthing in arrears
I improved my croft very extensively and I was worthily considered the best crofter in the parish and my croft still shows the great improvements I made
Had similar crofts been worked in the same manner I have no hesitation in saying that the value of the Lord Macdonald estates would have greatly increased and that crofters would not require such outside assistance as they have been receiving from the south and elsewhere for some years
My father and grandfather were resident in the same township both holding crofts and during their lifetime ground officers to Lord Macdonald
The present farmer of this township of Ferrindonald only works my lot and my fathers which we improved and the remaining five lots are in a miserable condition without the slightest improvement
I am living for the last thirteen years as a cottar on one of the crofts of Sasaig in a house which is not fit for a human being to live in as the medical officer for this parish said when attending to my child on her deathbed her sickness being brought on by the coldness and dampness of this house
I am still willing to take a croft and benefit myself and family
During all the time the croft was in my possession I never had cause to leave the parish but when it was taken from me I had then to go to the south and elsewhere to earn a living for myself and family
It will be sixtyfive years of age on the th of July first
That the township was taken from us by that man and fifteen other families were removed on his account also
About sixteen years ago
Corrie
I got the value of the house I left
I think it reached up to  or 
Draining and putting a fence about it and I was working that croft till it was considered an example to the country about
My father was forty years ground officer in the township and my grandfather before him
I was farming with my father always until Lord Macdonald gave me that lot and when Lord Macdonald died Archibald Macpherson was his grieve in Armadale and his son a butler in the castle and that is the way our township was cleared and the people were scattered through the country
No nothing but the house
Yes for thirteen years
No
I had my brother as clerk
My brother was in the township as I was myself and he was put out of the township to another and I was put to Camuscross
We are  miles from each other
The general inspector was not thinking it suitable there should be such a distance between my clerk and myself and I resigned for that reason
I then got to be subinspector under Mr Findlay
No other way but just depending upon the crofters in the township for peats and ground on which I can plant potatoes
Only one year and a half
Yes
Yes
Very poor in the main
There are some well off but in the main they are very poor
Yes
Yes and comparing those whom I know in other parts of the country they are decidedly poorer here as a whole
Yes
Loch Broom Invergarry and Wester Ross
So far as I have seen them I think they are of the same class
I cannot account for it
I know the fact exists
That is all I can speak to
I do very much indeed
So the people tell me
Yes the people themselves are very much against the subdivision
They see the folly of it and have several times expressed their approbation of a rule to be enforced against it
I have heard it is though I cannot give any authority for that
On that I have not sufficient knowledge of this part of the country to enter
I may have thought of various things but I have not matured anything
Yes I have
There are some who might and ought to take the advantage of it
I would not say there are very many
Yes
It used to be suitable  but I dont wish it to be understood that I want to take anybodys land from them
There is undoubtedly land suitable for crofting
And give up their crofts altogether
Yes but so far as possible I do not see why they should not be fishermen on a small scale and have a croft too
By a small scale I mean going across to Loch Hourn
I do not think they can possibly fish in the way the east coast fishermen do and carry on both occupations
Well to judge from what successful fishermen are in other places I should say so
I see no reason
They are all that
I am sorry to say it is not what it should be
Yes
I think it might be
By various meansby trying persuasion so far as that can go and that has been tried to a very great extent
It has improved slightly though it is not what I would wish it to be
It is improving slightly but I quite see some steps must be taken unless it gets better than it is now
Yes no doubt about that
Yes
Yes
Yes
I cannot say my knowledge of the country is so great that I can say very much about it
There is undoubtedly money coming into the country from the south
I have known several instances of money being sent from the south to friends here and undoubtedly money does come though I cannot give you any instances of it
Chiefly unmarried
Some married men do go but they are chiefly unmarried who go both males and females
I have no doubt that is the case
I dont know I can give instances but I think it is possible it may and I have no doubt it does have a bad effect
I cannot charge my memory with any particular case
I think in the main they do
In the main they do
There may be some cases in which they dont but I think in the main they do
There are some cases but they are not so numerous as they might be
Yes
I intended to speak of the very great inconvenience to which the parish is subjected
It seems to me there is a difficulty connected with it namely that in the parish at present I do not know that there is anybody disengaged who is very suitable to undertake the office of inspector
There are people perfectly able to do it but they are engaged otherwise and there is that difficulty a difficulty which is not insurmountable but at present a very serious inconvenience does exist
So far as I believe they are
Yes
Yes
I know that that is the case and some people even who are not children
Yes
Yes
Well I should say not
If he were in a better position he would endeavour to clothe them
I quite think so
I just wish to say with regard to the soil here that the remarks some people made might seem to imply that it was naturally bad
I dont think the soil is naturally bad
I think it is naturally fertile but from the constant cropping it has undergone it has lost its fertility but naturally it is a very fertile soil indeed
As regards my connection with the appointment of delegates I fear there may be some misconception
I  thought it my duty to take steps to enlighten and guide them and the statements which were read today were their own statements put down at their own request
I thought there was an observation in the evidence of one delegate that the people had not a full opportunity of expressing their wishes
If so they had themselves to blame because they got full notice of the meeting and of the nature of the meeting too
Yes
It has come out in evidence that I was for several years factor for Lord Macdonald and I simply wish to touch upon one or two points that have come out today
In the first place on the farm of Caligary it was said they were not allowed to keep sheep
I refused to allow them to keep sheep because they were not included in the summing
It was against the rules of the property to allow them to have sheep
Most of them however have a few sheep and these graze for the greater part of the year upon my own ground
If they keep sheep they certainly must reduce their present summingthat stands to reasonunless they got additional ground
It would certainly be a very great benefit to them if they could keep sheep and I should be very much pleased so far as I am concerned if they kept sheep even to my own personal loss
I pass from that to the evidence of Donald Beaton Carradale
He was a cottar and the son of a cottar who never held land
A lot became vacant at Carradale and remained vacant for some years
I did not want to let that lot as I knew the place would ultimately come to be cleared
He pestered me till he got the lot at Carradale on the understanding that it was a temporary holding
His paying  of arrears against a former tenant requires explanation
Without having my books to refer to I cannot exactly give a satisfactory explanation though I will be very glad to do so on a subsequent occasion
But I should like to ask the witness what privileges he got on entering and whether he is not mixing up the sum he had to pay to the proprietor for arrears against the former tenant with an account which he owed to me personally
I know he did not pay to Lord Macdonald one single fraction of rent for the arrears of that tenant
It may be necessary for me to state that I had dealings with the tenant but it was a thing I could not possibly avoid at the time
He was certainly under a misapprehension when he stated that he had to pay  for I know perfectly well that he had not to pay  I said his going there was a temporary arrangement
He knew perfectly well that he should be removed very soon after
He was removed from there to a better place I hold a most decidedly better place and a better bargain in every way
Carradale was  miles from the nearest point to any public road
The cause of the tenants being removed from there was on account of the Education Act of  coming into operation about that time and the parish could not afford to build a house or keep a teacher for the few tenants that were there
Two of the tenants had previously left that farm to better themselves and I may say speaking truly there were only four tenants instead of six
It has been inferred I am afraid by the Commissioners from questions that have been put to different witnesses that I wanted to remove these tenants to make room for myself
Well
I may state that I sublet a farm of very considerable extent in the immediate neighbourhood of the farm of Carradale the rent of which was charged something like  and the tenants paid  and I offered it to the Carradale tenants who had been previously deprived of it by a predecessor of mine
I sublet a large portion of my farm which is in the immediate neighbourhood
The rent of this farm is  and the rent of the other is   and I consider that in value they are something like proportionally rented
In my time as factor I changed no tenants except the Carradale tenants and I wish that any one here present should come forward and state without any fear of suffering from my handsand it has been explained to them that they will not suffer from the proprietor or the present factorwhether I have changed any tenants except the Carradale tenants and these were changed to benefit themselves and the parish in general
A good deal has been said today about a notice as to shops
There were several witnesses examined as to a notice that was put up or said to be put up about those shops
The Rev
Mr Graham gave very strong evidence
I do not for one moment doubt that Mr Graham saw the notice to which he referred or he would not have spoken to it but I will say that if that notice was put up it must have been a most decided forgery because I never ordered a notice to be put up and it is a queer coincidence that the innkeeper and his son are here today and several merchants and others who still testify to what I say
No such notice was ever put up
The only way in which I can account for the statement is this that I did put up a notice in the very words or to the same effect that is borne out by Mr Graham not on this property but on the property of Glendale
Well I did that with the full instructions after very careful investigation on the part of the proprietor who was not a man at all to do a thing hurriedly and I may explain to the Commissioners that ray reason for doing so was that in the small district of Glendale which though small is a very populous district the small shops were becoming a nuisance
In every township there were four five or six shops
There was a good deal of shebeening going on
The people bartered a good deal giving their eggs and other produce to go south and getting whisky in return
This was considered by the proprietor and myself to be very injurious to the district and I put up a notice which I may say generally was put up more to keep people in order than as necessarily to be acted upon that any one opening a shop would be charged an increase of  I can only account for the notice that is spoken of as appearing in the pariah of Strath and in the parish of Sleat on the ground that it has been mixed up with this notice that I put up at Glendale
I most emphatically deny that I put a notice at Strath or Sleat but I did put it up at Glendale and I have given the reason
Whatever connection I may have had with the Isle Ornsay shopit is quite unnecessary to go into detail on that matterI certainly did not keep down shops in Sleat and I think there are several small shopkeepers here who will testify that neither by myself nor by any one connected with me did I object to shops
In fact I encouraged shops and after the letting of Isle Ornsay I lent a man in the little village of Ardvaser  to prosecute his business as a shopkeeper
I am sorry to say he came to grief and I lost my  
If had been so much connected wish the Isle Ornsay shop as people wish to make out it would be queer that I should set up an opposition shop and lose my interest there
It has been alleged that I bought cattle and that I have taken advantage of the people in buying cattle from them at a cheaper rate than they would otherwise have got
I challenge any man or woman or anybody having cattle to sell to come up and say to me that I ever said to them Sell me your beast cheaper than I could get it at the market rate and I say conscientiously without wishing to give myself any credit for it that I never bought a beast at home that I was not giving full value and sometimes giving more than the market value for
I was said to be a drover
I am not a drover
I was a very extensive grazier and I could afford to give more than an ordinary drover because I gave the cattle grass and they grew upon my grass
Another thing was not only hinted at but was most decidedly brought forward here and I am sorry to say it was brought forward by a minister Mr Graham  that undue influence was used by me at a school board election
I was factor at the time and my clerk was returning officer and I wish to explain the circumstances
I speak from a very bad memory but so far as I remember Mr Graham was coming with me from some place in the north of Skye and I gave him a seat in my cart up to Ostaig
I told him that with the view of avoiding the expense of a poll I had asked Mr Campbell tenant of Knock my brotherinlaw who was one of the candidates to retire in favour of Mr Graham who I thought ought to have a seat
It seems however and I do not blame Mr Graham for it at all because I think he is above doing itthat Dr Campbell who is now dead told me not long afterwards  I agreed to resign my seat at the school board in favour of Mr Graham but Mr Graham has gone about not believing your statement that he would be appointed in my stead canvassing for votes au I as he has chosen to do that I shall certainly go onwe shall have a poll and I shall stand I dont care a bit if Mr Graham carries the day well and goodhe is as deserving as I am
There was a poll and  was the returning officer
I was there
I do not deny that I had a great deal of influence with the people
Certainly it was not more than was natural as factor but I will say most emphatically that not one single bit of influence was used against Mr Graham or any other man and that the election was carried on as straightforwardly as any election ever was in hand
In my capacity as factor I perhaps have the interest of the proprietor more at heart than that of the tenants  still I never neglected the tenants when I could do otherwise
As to the rise of rent that came upon this property and unfortunately for me happened in my day times were prosperous and rents were going up
Rents in other parts of Skve without naming anybody in particular were going up   even  percent
There was no rise upon Lord Macdonalds property and Lord Macdonald naturally turned to me and said Here I have had a valuator round to value the sheep farms
He asked me what was the increase on the sheep farmers rents
I said it was about  I did not want to hurt the tenants by any means
Lord Macdonald is one of the best men in the world
He did not want to hurt the tenants
He did it from the most kindly motives  but still every man should have his rights
Well a valuator came from the east coast to value the large sheep farms
Every one was put up
I said I would not like to raise the crofts according to the value put upon them by an east coast man but I asked him if he would allow me to have them valued
 Certainly he said  I have implicit confidence in you
Put  or  or s upon them just as you please
Well the matter was left in my hand and if there was any blame I take the whole responsibility of it
Well I got two competent men and sent them over every inch of the property
They gave me their report I told the tenants the nature of the investigation and asked them if they would have an east coast man put upon their land to value it and they said nothey would agree to anything I did
I asked them   Will you all agree to my estimate
Yes most decidedly
I spoke to each tenant as he came up to pay his rent and asked if he was pleased and I never heard a murmur
One man said We have paid enough  we dont wan to pay more
These facts can be borne out because the valuation roll will show what the rent was before my time and what it was afterwards and I dont think I am speaking erroneously when I say that on the aggregate  per cent will be about the rise
Well another thing that I want to point out particularly is this
There has been a great deal said about drainage and about the improvements the tenants have made
I distinctly told the people whom I sent out to give this report not to go by the case of a man who had improved his lands but most decidedly to go by the old value of the croftthat is what had been put upon the croft at the first settlingand the tenants were not charged for their improvements but simply charged an increase of land according to the first value so far as a report was given to me and so far as I could judge
I will not say there may not have been a case in which one man was charged more than another according to the first value but I say that was the basis on which the valuation went on
Something has been said about the seaware
That is a very small matter and not one I daresay in which I had very much to do  but I will say in the interest of Lord Macdonald that the seaware is not charged by the proprietor separately
The seaware is given to the tenants along with their lauds and they are not charged separately
In some townships I admit they have not in every case a sufficient amount of seaweed because seaweed like everything else that is overcropped has deteriorated in bulk and in value and in some cases the tenants may have to go to another township and buy from there but that does not put one shilling into the pockets of Lord Macdonald  it  goes into the pocket of the tenant holding the land from which the seaware is drawn
Lord Macdonald does not pocket a single shilling
As for me I may say I have about three miles of coast on which there is a considerable lot of seaweed and I am afraid I may appear egotistical but after all that has been said I may be privileged to say that ah that sea ware is cut now by the tenants in my neighbourhood and one single shilling I never received
Tormore and Ostaig I previously farmed Gillen which I held for a small number of years and I had been in the habit of selling seaweed to the neighbouring farms
That went on and I did get a small sum occasionally for it but it was more for the principle than for the object of getting money
That farm is sublet to a Macdonald man now who no doubt has his pound of flesh
John MInnes Drumfearn said that his rent went up a few years ago
I should like to ask John MInnes what was his rent ten years ago and what is his rent todaywhat amount of land he held ten years ago and what amount of land he holds today
Some of the Drumfenrn people said there was a Carradale man settled there
The Carradale men were simply drafted into places that became vacant
No man was disposed to make room for a Carradale man and there was one man from Carradale who got into possession of a lot that was vacant at the time and for which there was no tenant A good deal has been said about drainage money
I was fortunate enough during the time I was factor not to borrow any money for drainage because I saw that the people were not pleased with it and in fact did not understand it but I am now in the unfortunate position of having to pay     and  of drainage money for drain made by the previous tenant and though I say it is a misfortune to pay it still I say the land is worth the additional rent
I do not know what is done on every property but I do know what is done generally on the west coast and that is that when Government money is borrowed the outlay is considered when it is done judiciously to be a permanent improvement and though the interest and capital is got back in twentyfive or twentyone years still the rent goes on because it is considered to be a permanent improvement
I do not thinkand I speak for myself as well as for othersthat the tenants have any reason to complain of the rent here
I shall now be very glad to answer any questions that any of the Commissioners may put
He has mixed up two or three questions
Yes and a debt which I do not expect ever to recover
It was a practice that was pretty general and it was enforced but I think that most people are under a misapprehension in respect to it and I think perhaps the tenant themselves are because in dealing with a question of this kind the outgoing tenant would make certain arrangements with the factor
He might for instance give up the crop at Martinmas and give up the tillage or give over his house and then he might in fact be entitled to some little bonus for improvements
I would not say there might not be a question of arrears because singular matters have come before me in which the arrears of the former tenant have been paid to myself by the incoming tenant but it was a simple matter of arrangement in which when the incoming tenant came forward and said  I am quite willing to take this place the outgoing tenant requires so much he maybe going to America or Australia or to exchange to some other part of the property but he will not go unless he gets so much and it will be a benefit to me and a benefit to him if this exchange takes place
I am quite willing to pay the money down and let the contract go on
Well the factor steps in and carries out this arrangement
The man who comes in may not have the money to go in for it at once but it is carried out
Sometimes certainly the arrears of the former tenant in such cases have been paid but it is not commonly in practice
I did not expect to be examined on that question
Well I am not afraid to make a statement
I supplied meal I am very sorry to say  to a lot of tenants in this parish
The shop at Isle Ornsay became out of lease as the former tenant would not give the rent that was put upon it by a valuator
He was offered it and would not take it
I induced the man Kennedy who holds it to come forward and give a rent certainly very little different from the rent which the former tenant had offered but a rent at which he had been pressed by me and Lord Macdonalds Edinburgh agents to take the place
I induced Kennedy to come forward but Kennedy was not at the time prepared financially to come forward and take it
I became personally responsible to the bank and otherwise for him
That arrangement I may say has still continued
I did not at all intend to participate in the profits or to be a partner in the concern nor am I  but I will say this to corroborate my statement that since the time Kennedy took the place eight nine or ten years ago I never examined a ledger I never examined a cash book and I do not know in the very slightest degree how Mr Kennedy stands financially
I may have asked him in an offhand way whether the shop was doing well but beyond that I know nothing but whether I owe money to Kennedy or he owes money to me is a question I think the Commissioners need hardly inquire into
It was a matter of my own to induce this man to come forward and give Lord Macdonald a bigger rent than he would otherwise get and I said to Kennedy that if he could not manage the concern which is a very large concern if my influence or my name was of use to him it was at his service
Well I did it for the whole combinedcertainly not for my own profit
I gave the people a good deal of meal at the time and I admit I wanted to get out of that
I went into it at haphazard and without due consideration but the one had nothing to do with the other
Kennedy did not take over a penny of my accounts
They are due by the people and very likely still will be due
I certainly had no wish to benefit myself and as for saying I wished to benefit the people that is a question which I must be permitted not to answer
I did on several occasions because as I said I am more of a farmer and grazier than a factor
I took the office of factor simply because I was driven into it
I should not have been a factor and I am sorry I was
I bought the cattle with a very pure conscience and I never got an animal from  the people at a shilling less than they would have got from another and generally I think I was paying a great deal more
No  and I did not do it very largely
I bought extensively at the markets where a man can exercise his freedom in any way he likes I must sayand I think any tenant here will back me out unless it is somebody very much interested against methat on any occasion on which I bought cattle from them I was pressed into doing it and it was difficult for me to avoid it
During the time I was factor I always had an eye to being out of it
I t was a thing I got into and I always wished to get out of it and I always continued more or less my capacity as grazier and farmer
Yes
I never went so far as I know to a mans house to ask him to favour me by selling me beasts
Perfectly Ronald MDonald and Duncan MInnes
I may further mention that in a locality like this if I was asked to value a croft in the parish of Sleat in any portion of it and it is a wide district I could do it as well sitting at my desk as if I went to it
From my knowledge of the land from my knowledge of the soil and from my general knowledge of the place altogether
I know what every man in the parish of Sleat does pay and what he should pay and in the parish of Strath too
There are old maps of the Macdonald estates in the factors hands
I rather think it does but I cannot speak from memory
I think I have taken it myself from that but I really would not like to say definitely
I was aware that power would be given me to attend at Portree
I dont know that I shall attend  but if there is a lot of dirt thrown at me as has been done of late I dont mind going up and trying to throw it off
Yes
Not much
The principal cause of my complaint is the increase that was put on our rents especially on my own rent
I was feeling it most
I consider my rent was increased greater than that of any other lot
It was only a disordered place the ground being full of holes and rocks and trees
I cannot tell the acreage of it
Three cows and a twoyearold and twelve sheep anil a horse
 s
Eight or nine years ago I was only paying  s d
Sixteen or seventeen shillings of increase was then made on my rent
Draining I myself draining it without any remuneration
Besides that I am paying the interest of the former drainage money that was got from the landlord
The drainage I made myself was upon ground which had been previously drained
Stone drains
Some of them this spring itself and if I was not improving my lot in that way I might not put down any crop at all
Yes
About thirteen or fourteen years ago when I got the croft
I think seven or eight years after that
Never
I do not think it was in consequence of the improvements but according to his own conscience
I cannot very well say
Yes I remember some things very well
Various prices
The price of stock does not last long at the same figure
I cannot be very sure
I believe the prices were less then than they are today
Yes I think so
No I do not think it unjust so to increase the rent if the good prices should continue but what is entered into the landlords books lasts
No never
We do not hear of any tiling of that kind
I never heard of any such thing
Including it
The drainage is included in the rent
I spoke to get the drainage money remitted to me
To the present factor
I knew by him that lie would rather increase my rent
No
There are eight families
Yes
Every one of them had his rent raised
Yes
My rent is smaller than that of my neighbours or the other lots are larger than mine
I felt the increase on my rent more because it was an increase on me
That is what I cannot tell
You may leave it as it is in the paper
We continued working all the same
We are of opinion that the land is dear at any rate for a crop does not grow on it
I have to buy the seed with which to sow it
Yes
Our statement is   There are at present fourteen families here where at one time there were but five
This was about seventy years ago
The size of the lots run from about three to four acres and the rents run between   s and  s
Three of the lots are subdivided and in two cases one tenant holds several lots
It is a complaint that they are still charged interest on public money borrowed about thirty years ago for drains
It is complained that the rents have been raised on lands which they themselves reclaimed from mossy bogs also that whereas they consider there ought to be a right to cut ware attached to the township they have to go a distance for it and pay from s to s each for it
It was proposed and agreed to that Kenneth Macdonald Donald M innes and Angus Macpherson be appointed from Stonefield
I have to say that in the crofts which are divided into two halves the occupants of each half have such a small stock the half lot only keeps one cow and a threeyearold and should it happen that one of these beasts would get into a quagmire or be lost otherwise we would then be as good as without stock
Now if a man had a place on which he could keep four or five cows if he lost one of these he would not feel it
The increase of the rest of his stock would be coming on and he would soon be able to replace the lost one
Again if he has a young family growing up the one who has so little stock as I mention has to keep his children in clothing and shoes he has to send them to school and to pay the school fees regularly
Now it is not easy for him to feed them when he cannot get that feeding out of his own ground
He has not got ground that will yield crop it is so weak
He must needs cultivate every bit of it each year he cannot leave any of it out and if he does not use all the corn that grows to him in feeding his stock they will die on him
Then in spring he will need to buy seed oats
If ho had as much land as would keep work to one man all the year without the necessity of leaving home I would undertake that he would take out of that food for himself and his family and have his stock as well so that his stock would be strong and in good condition for the market
And it is the smallness of their holdings that has brought them to poverty entirelywhere they are crowded together like sheep in a fank
I may say they are surrounded with iron shepherds iron herds and that they cannot move a foot
Now what has left such a small proportion of land for the people and plenty of land wasted in the country without an inhabitant
It would be easy enough to take them out of these straitened circumstances with so much land to relieve them
About the drainage money the people themselves were at fault
When the time had run during which the money was to have been paid they should have spoken to the factor and seen if that money was to be taken off them at the time
Perhaps if they had spoken at that time it might have been taken off so they themselves were to blame
I cannot say it was a written promise
None of that was made in my presence
No doubt of that
Yes the land is better to the present day
They are complaining that perhaps the rent is high enough as it is
I have only half a croft but the summing of a full croft is three cows and a twoyearold
Yes a horse to each lot
I am keeping a horse and buying pasture
Twelve sheep
About 
I am thinking if I had a full croft that I could pay it
Yes
No doubt because the increase of my stock will not be so much
One shilling in the pound
I am not sure but I think that is the amount of interest they were paying
I made no terms about it
I had not this land at all when the expenditure for drains was made upon it
I took it at the rent at which it wns
Yes
One thing I have to tell
It was with injustice that I myself was placed there forty years ago
I was put out of Ferrindonald and placed in Tarskaveg and Ferrindonald was three times set since then
I have nothing further to say concerning our township except what is written
When Linigary and Kilbeg were cleared a family from each of these townships was settled in Tarskaveg
It is a long time since then
It was in factor Macphersons time
I was young at the time but I well remember it
It was at first under four or five crofters
Long long ago
Their grandchildren are now in the place
Yes
That was before the land was divided into lots
In the year  the lots were first divided
Thirty one and nine or ten of these have now two families settled upon them
I cannot say anything about that
The people of Tarskaveg got the lots as a matter of course the most of them but there were some families taken away from other places
There are only three of these lots the families on which have arisen by natural increase and in the others the increase has been by strange families being brought on
For drainage
That was the year the potatoes failed when we got the Government money
We were paying it out of the rent again
Yes
We are paying it still
That was the account of it I got when we got the order to make the drains
I am not aware we ever spoke to the factor about it
The church of Kilmore is about five miles from us
I believe the head of the roadway is  or  miles from us
Only a footpath
Yes
Yes I believe I will
It is not very good it was at one time good
Yes
There is no place where we can draw up our boats from the march of Tarskaveg at all
We go to the south side of Tockavaig pier
We have a sort of a quay but it is spoiled with the sea
Yes
There is a good part of it made already
We made it
Sometimes I fish
Yes
That we had at one time our land very much cheaper than we have to day
Our rents were raised twice upon us and the reason why we had the land less at first was that we were engaged at the ferry at Kylerhea and all the cattle leaving Uist and Lewis and Skye were ferried across this Kyle
Our land was then rented at only s as we had to be in constant attendance at the ferry
At that time there were neither steamers nor  trains to relieve us of that work but now there are both and we have no work at all and our land was after that raised twice
Our summing is two cows but we have to keep one of these upon the stance of the droves and we can only winter one of them with what grows on our own land
Neither
We have to be out s in seaware to plant our potatoes
Yes
There is no seaware on our own land at all
What we have of seaware on our land would not plant a bag of potatoes
This man and I are furthest out of our townships and it is very little of either corn or potatoes or clover that grows on our land that is not consumed by the deer
I may say this is the case with three of us
Our township is not fenced and we are not able to fence it
The proprietor will not do it
Corrie increased our rents s and Tormore s
Our rents are thus double what they were then and we have only a small bit of ground
Thirteen families have land
There are eleven crofters in our township and the innkeeper has another croft or two
We were getting d for every head of cattle we ferried and the half of that went to the innkeeper
There were five of us manning the boat and the threepence was divided among us except what was charged for grass and oats
Since the trains began to take away the stock we get little or nothing
There was one time when we would make  or  in the year and now we will not make more than 
We must always attend to the ferry
We must be in constant attendance at the ferry
We have to be in constant attendance for the ferrying of stock but not for the ferrying of passengers
There is only ferrying to be done at the market times
Yes
We have to be in attendance whether there are markets or not
We are the crew of the boat
Yes
We are paid just according to the income of the ferry
We get half the dues
He would put another person in my place and he might expel me from my land
Yes
We are tenants of Lord Macdonald
He might bring in another man who would do his work
He had only to say one word to the proprietor that I would not do my work and another would be put in my place
No
I cannot say anything about that
There is no one who is able to work for wages who would not earn more than 
Yes very easy
About half a mile
Yes
I do not know but it would need more than that but the half mile would be scanty
I t would fence our three lots
Yes and less than a mile
I did I asked Tormore
Yes we would
Twenty or twentyone years
Yes they are coming in tens and twelves about our houses
They are just coming to our doors
They were not there twenty years ago
They consume our corn quite as much as if it were consumed by the muir bird
No never
No
A wire fence
With reference to the deer a wire fence  feet high would be a better protection against the deer than a stone dyke
Doubtless it would
I myself would say that a wire fence was a better protection
Yes
Yes we would be very glad to do that
The Established Church
Yes
Yes
Only that the place is so much confined
That is the particular complaint we have to make
The lot was originally laid out the same as the other lots and the man who got it did not take it and the township took that lot again for a passage for the cows and the rent was laid upon themselves
After that another man got the lot and the rent was never changed and the man who got that lot was paying it to the landlord
I can only say that since that lot was taken from us our rents were somewhat increased
I cannot be sure only that I know it was raised a little
I cannot be very sure but I think it is upwards of sixty years ago
Their earnings
Every man is now in a hurry to get the spring work past to be off to his workto be off to work on sea and land all through the kingdom and when they return if their earnings have succeeded well they pay the shop and the shopman supplies them on credit as they require it
There is no doubt it has put them to very great inconvenience and hardship that their holdings were reduced and the land was exhausted with constant cultivation during the past sixty years
The summing of our lots is two cows each and the crop that grows upon our lots will not feed these two cows
These are small lots
From  s to  s besides dues
That is difficult for me to sayas Providence will deal with them
Some bring less or more than others
I would think between  and 
From five to thirteen months
The one whose earnings did not succeed very well might only have to stay away four or five months
It is getting slacker
It was at fishing that the people made most money and now the fishing has got slack
They only fish on shares and some of them in that way may only incur debts
That the master is giving half the fishing to the crew and they are paid according to the amount of fish and if they dont make a good fishing they get nothing
Yes and to the south country and everywhere else
Very few
Middling
The fishing about here during the past two years was not very good except on two short occasions
Yes
They go with their own boats to these fishings
Very middling
They did not succeed very well
That is my opinion that they would do better if they had fishing appliances of their own
I cannot very well speak about that for it is not my work but there are some fishermen here who can tell
I was there ever since I was born
I know that in times gone by it was easier for people to come through than today
The clothing and shoes of today may be quite as good as the clothing and shoes of my early days for at that time people were not earning the wages they are now and the merchants are giving such extensive credit to the people now that the merchant with whom we deal is dealing very freely indeed with the people
I know that they do
In the way the people were in my early recollection the people had to live on whatever they could grow out of their own holdings
Since that time crops began to go back and then of course when they had to buy from the merchants it must be heavier on them than before
Yes in my early recollection
We dont make meal at all now
Yes when we buy it
We do not grow it
Yes but the ground has become so slack that the corn crop has to be used for feeding cattle unthrashed
Yes
I eannot make that out the time is so long since I did make meal of it
No
Three to four individuals I think will consume a boll of meal in twenty days and that will amount to a considerable quantity
Yes  and sometimes in harvest time they may have some potatoes
No
Yes but I know that it is the smallness of the holdings of the people that has caused a great deal of the poverty and if our holdings were somewhat larger we would be more able to stand our credit and we would be very much the better of it
That cannot be done without breaking in upon land in the occupancy of others
No our crofts are so small already
No
The land is so sniall that when it happens the son comes to years he has to go elsewhere
Yes for the past sixty years
I think there are only two lots on which there are two families each and that is all the difference
Yes
About nineteen years
Yes
Yes
Yes
There may be part of what was said today that I may not be very well up in
Yes They were under great hardships
Yes some of them but the merchant here was very favourable to them
I never saw him taking advantage of the people when they would be hard up he would relieve them
Yes
A guinea a boll that is the credit price
Yes
All but two
Only the poverty of the people and the scantiness of their land
Six cows and a horse was what was in use to be the case
Eight sheep
Yes
No
I have half a lot and it gives me enough to do to feed two cows upon it
Yes a horse and four sheep
I am a labourer too
I have bean a labourer for the past thirtyfour years
It would be enough to do to feed four cows and a horse and eight sheep
NAME
 s
Yes
It is small enough
Give them land somewhere else
Plenty through the island
Yes plenty
All up and down about here
Knock Ord Armadale Ostaig Tormore Gillen plenty land there under big sheep
Mr Kennedy
They would take a share of it
If they would get it in a way they could live on it
If they would get enough land that they would take their living out of it they could stock it in time
They cannot feed them
Yes the place is so small when there are four families on a lot that they cannot keep stock
Yes if they would get it at a reasonable rent
Yes
Rent that we could pay and for land out of which we could extract a living
We have not much to say about the rent
It seems reasonable if the ground were in the way we could make a living out of it
Yes
Yes
I think so
Yes Mr Macdonald Ord Mr Macdonald Tormorehe has Ostaig Duncan MInnes Gillen Mr Kennedy Knock
Ferrindonald I may include in the number of tacks it is in the hands of Mr Macpherson
Kinloch is not in this parish
Yes
It is the only shop in the district
Doubtless if there were four or five or six other shops in the district it would be easier for people to get goods and cheaper
No
Yes
No I did not hear
No it might be without my knowing it should I see it I could not read it
No I never heard anything about it
There is one lot which is subdivided into four sharesthese being subdivided to the sons of the family
Possibly they might come to be subdivided in time
Yes very poor
Some of them have
Some of them have not
Very few have money in the bank
Earning it by working for others
If we would get the land we would be trying to stock it
Yes
I believe they were all present except one
Not much about that
But I could speak about the place in which I was born and brought up because I have been only fourteen years in my present holding
Kilmore
As you have heard already there were two lots cleared there
Four widows were cleared off these and a widower
They were cleared without any reason whatever but just to make room for another man who was a ground officer
Ronald Macdonald
We were then placed in Saasaig
A brother and his family and I with my widowed mother were placed there and the place which we got in Saasaig was not much more than half the size of the place which we left
I did not get the house which I should have got with tho land as the factor and the landlord were against me
I was put into a small bothy that had been built for a stable and byre and I sometimes could take the snow off the bedclothes with my hand while in bed
I dared not open my mouth about that
The woman who was left in the house which I should have got is still there and I get no thanks for her occupancy of it
That is all I have to say about it
The house I got in Saasaig was not fit to be entered by man at all
I built a house in Kilmore for myself
I quarried the stones and I am sure I carted them for a distance of a quarter of a mile
That house was valued by the ground officer without asking me and I only got  for the woodwork and all that the house was worth
No none whatever unless from the neighbours from whom I might have got an occasional help
Yes recently but I lived eight years in that bothy
It did not cost me much in money but it cost me my time and my labour
I spent no money on it
A brother and myself built the house and the factor Tormore supplied me with timber for it gratis and besides that he carried it free to my place for he saw what sort of a place it was in which I was living
The windows cost me about s or s
The doors would cost me about s or s
Yes but he is not the ground officer today
He has two lots
He has the same two lots that he got
Yes
Yes
Tormore
It was in Corries time I was put away from Kilrnore but it was Tormore who helped me
I cannot say anything beyond what is written
Not since I came to Saasaig
Fourteen years
Yes it is mentioned in the paper that there are four families on one lot and two families on other lots what I have seen myself
I have seen the most of these crofts occupied by one family
I dont remember of any families brought in from other townships
We are not at all certain we will not be removed
I am not the least afraid myself
Should I be removed tomorrow I would be put in a very bad place indeed for I think I am in as bad a place now as possible
I have a little more to say
I am since I was fifteen years of age accustomed to go to sea fishing and the place in which we are is very inconvenient for this purpose
It would be very easy at small expense to make a good place for it for there is a bay on our shore
We cannot approach our shores in stormy weather unless there are men enough to draw the boat up
And now as to the trawling it is doing us great harm especially in the past year for I have seen last year in Loch Hourn thousands of crans of herrings go to the bottom useless for any purpose owing to the trawling
The loch is narrow and shallow and when the trawl is out it will almost sweep the loch of herring from side to side
By these trawling operations the herring were so disturbed that they could not be got with our nets
I know that there would have been ample fishing last year for everybody to satisfy them till they could stop it of their own accord were it not for the trawling as I have seen it in previous years
Yes I saw them last winter in Loch Hourn picking the biggest herrings out of the take and throwing the small ones overboard by thousands of crans
There are plenty here who can bear evidence and support me in saying that
There is nothing surer
It will scare away the herring from narrow and shallow lochs
The schoolrates and poorrates are coming very heavily upon us  and there are no wages to be earned here as everybody knows
It is Saasaig I mean for the pier
Just at the farm of Knock
It is a good bay
The people of the place itself would help to erect it
I think with the assistance of  or  the people of the place could make a very suitable pier themselves
No I do not think they would require that
There are people in our town here who could do every turn of it
My mother has a half croft
Yes
By all the township
The people of both townships were present
Yes
  Kilmore
This township consists of six lots two are held by one  tenant two hold entire lots and four subdivided lots
The same complaint of holdings being too little prevails though not to the same extent
At present they hold a certain extent of hill pasture but about eleven years ago they were deprived of a large piece
It was proposed and agreed to that Malcolm Macpherson be appointed a delegate from Kilmore
The smallness of our holdings
The Kilmore people complain of the scantiness of their land
I do not think we have anything to complain of other than what is written
Soine of them were sent to Stonefield some others to Saasaig
To make room for one of those who were sent to Ferrindonald
I am speaking about the two lots which the man got who was put in upon us
When Ferrindonald was cleared one of its families was put into our township
Four families at least were removed out of Kilmore for that one family
Macpherson who was then manager at Armadale
His sons
 s bare rent for half a croft
Two cows and one horse is allowed to the whole croft and I keep that horse
No
Yes
Yes a fewfive and some have more than that
They are all the same rent
That is for a half lot
Well I dont know
 s and  s the half lot
They were divided before I was born
Yes
I think he had a whole lot but he gave the half to his brother
Yes
About three years
The man who got the village after it was cleared was there before him
Not that I am aware of
Donald was taken from Carradale to Ferrindonald
The tenant of Ferrindonald gave two lots to this man who came from Carradale
Three came from Carradale and the three have two lots between them
One of the township lots
The ground officer had that croft before Macpherson
There was nobody in the lot before him when he came
One man had the township and he gave up two lots to the township
Macpherson
The man who had Ferrindonald
No not to get into that place but he desired to tell that he was paying money for the croft which he had before he came to Ferrindonald
That was land he had in Carradale
His predecessor in the lot which he got in Carradale was  in arrears
Yes  he has now paid it all but a small sum and he paid a little of it since he came to Ferrindonald
I am not aware that he was
The party was a widow
That was common
It was common to ask that
I know it was the rule but I cannot very well mention cases
I know that the factor was demanding the arrears from the incoming tenant
I think it was Tormore
I dont remember very well
By Corrie
Archibald Macpherson
He was Lord Macdonalds manager at that time
Yes
Yes
Yes
There are eighteen lots in this township on which five entire lots are held by as many tenants the remaining thirteen being subdivided into as many as six divisions
They hold a fair extent of hill  pasture but it was explained that owing to an estate regulation they are prohibited from having any sheep on it
The ground of this regulation was that the tenants sheep were in the habit of trespassing on the Armadale plantations when newly planted
The trees having long since grown up and moreover a fence having been erected the cause of the prohibition seems to have been removed
It was proposed and agreed to that Angus MInnes and Alexander Robertson be appointed delegates from Caligary and Dugald Mlntyre from Ardvaser
Yes
They were not all there
There were eight or nine of them
They were working at Armadale and they could not attend the meeting till after six oclock and the meeting had to be held at five
There are eighteen lots in the township and these are subdivided and four of these lots are whole and there is one of the lots upon which there are six families
They might have been there altogether the people of the place
They did not understand what was the meaning of it
The crofts are all divided except five
They are in two halves except five and one of these lots is occupied by six families
Yes
There are two cottar families in the township who have no land at all and cannot even keep a hen
Yes the whole inhabitants of the township might have been there if they had understood it
Every one of the families would have been at the meeting if they chose
Yes
I have not much to say about them
They are crowded upon each other
I myself only occupied the fourth part of a lot which my grandfather had and my grandfather had twice as much as his neighbours had
Lord Alexander gave him two lots when the others had only one
When his Lordship was raising a regiment there were only seven families in the township at first before the year  and in that year the township was divided into eighteen lots and everyone who would send a son to his Lordships regiment would get a lot
Out of the seven families here in the township his Lordship got three recruits
There are some poor widows who have enough to do to keep what they have
Those who refused to supply his Lordship with soldiers got no land
They did not get land until after his Lordships death
Three of these were Macphersons and a factor named Macpherson came to the estate and he gave these Macphersons land
The township of Linigary was cleared and Ostaig was given to the mother of Major Macdonald and the inhabitants of that township were scattered about Strath and Sleat
One of these families was put in upon us
The occupants of the eighteen lots were made up by strangers from other places
There were some of them enlisted in his Lordships regiment and got the land and when the regiment was disbanded those who were for joining the regulars enlisted into other regiments and some of them never returned but were killed at Waterloo
No strangers were put in upon us since I remember
I cannot say I saw such a notice
I heard something about it but whether it was true or not I do not know
I heard a rumour about it Should I be sworn upon my honour I could not tell you about it
It was one of the merchants who said something to me about it but I do not remember rightly what he did say
I am not the least afraid but I am not going to say anything that is not right
If tha notice was there I never read it
The man who told me about it is not alive
The man who told me said to me  We must now pay  of rent
That is all I heard about it
That is not right
Every person had liberty to go to any shop that he pleased
Who can say that the factor had anything at all to do with the shop
On the shop sign I only see Neil Kennedy  Co and what would I know or what does anybody Alexander else know as to who is in company with Mr Kennedy
I dont know anything about it and who can say who the company is
I heard that such a notice was there but I never saw it
I only heard a rumour in that way but I know that no one was prevented from going to any shop he liked
I heard some such rumour
I never saw it in the newspaper
I sometimes get a newspaper and I never saw it but it might be in the paper
I heard that and I am not afraid that he will do anything to me
I am not the least afraid of any living man but I am not going to speak anything that is not right and just
The factor was sometimes buying beasts from us  but if he was none of us were under the necessity of selling to him unless we liked
I do not know
The factor has sometimes paid us more for our beasts than we could get at the market
He would go to the Broadford market himself and give a start to the market
Dear me we might do that if we liked
We were not bound to give our cattle to the factor
He never laid that upon us to do
I am not aware he did it at any time
The factor was a drover already and a good drover
I have no doubt it was from both motivesto do good to himself and to do good to the country as well
I cannot say we considered him a hard factor
I can say for the township
I have known me go to the factor for the loan of money wherewith to pay the rent and he gave it to me
How can I say he was a hard factor
Every one in our township will say the same thing
He was born beside us and we have known him since he was a boy
I am not aware that there was any dispute about that
There was one man who was not for me being appointed
Angus MInnes and he nominated himself as a delegate and he was elected also and he then withdrew
He is a tenant in Caligary and a servant to Mr Macdonald Tormore
The man was not understanding
He had not sufficient understanding
He was not understanding what he had to do
I said already that MInnes was not understanding the business and did not know what he was saying
He might not be afraid of that
I do not know what fear was on him
I cannot say it was such fear that prompted him
He might not be afraid of anything I had to say here today
I was only going to say the truth
I would not tell a lie for any man I ever saw
I do not think so
I know that that was rumoured
How could I know
I heard that rumour
I believe I am a little in debt
No
Yes
I believe so
I dont know how they could live but for the shop
I do not know about prices at Portree but I am sometimes in Glasgow and Greenock and Liverpool and sometimes I buy supplies which I send home and I know that the merchant has to pay freight on his goods and that he cannot sell his goods as cheap as I can buy them in Glasgow
Yes I am and I dont know how I would be alive if it was not there
I would not make a living out of the poor soil that I have
When Caligary was cut into lots it was about these years that the first plantation was planted at Armadale and it was protected only by turf and sheep were not allowed into Caligary until the plantation grew up
It was then fenced and the plantation grew
No doubt we would be the better of keeping sheep but I believe our factor will give us leave to do that
I think so
Part of it over eighty years
The plantation is being cut and replanted
I do not mean that
The fence must not be moved
We dont want the fence to be touched
Yes
Yes and we dont want the fence removed
There is a fence all round the plantation
They give employment to a few
There is no suitable land unless the landlord clears the townships of Caligary and Ardvaser and plants them and where the storm uproots the old trees he supplies the places with young trees
Yes
There is no reason why we should not be allowed sheep because the plantation is fenced and even Mr Macdonalds Tormore sheep cannot get over
Yes
No we were seeing that our present factor had too much to do since he became our factor and we were not for troubling him much but we are going to speak to him about it
Yes
Yes but he told us we could not be allowed as sheep were not included in our summing
Some of us had sheep and we were wanting that all of us should be allowed to keep them
No we did not think that was a satisfactory reason
I was asked to say that we were heavily taxed for school rates
I pay  s of rent and I pay s d of schoolrates s d of poorrates and s for the doctor
I was a fisherman once but not now
We had not much in the paper which we made up but one thing that we were complaining of was the way in which we are cramped in our township
We are overforty in a township which was originally occupied by nineteen families and we are quite as ill off as regards the sea as we are with respect to the land and more so
It is the extreme south end of Sleat
Any person of understanding can understand our condition
There are twelve years or more since we sent any seed to the mR in our parish
It is twelve years since the mill in our parish was working at all
We are in a bad place for boats without a port or a quay and in danger of our lives every day we are going out to sea
I was giving half of my lot to my son and others were doing the same
Yes
No not that I am aware of
No
No not that I know of
Yes
That we should get a sort of a quay made which would not be very expensive to which we could bring our boats in bad seasons
Yes all of them
Yes
Very much more so as we are turning the same ground constantly for the past sixty years and it does not now yield crop
Yes very much
No owing to the exhausted condition of the soil
Yes there is if the place were larger
The summing is so much and though we should summer the summing we are not able to winter them without buying food for them in other places
There is no doubt the place would come to be as good as it was before if it were occupied by as few
I cannot answer that question as I did not consult the people about it
I dont know
I would leave that to wiser people than myself
There is a small township in our own midst which was taken from us I cannot tell how long ago
Drennoch
That is another place
Five tenants
Yes
About  I think but I am not sure
Carradale
Macdonald of Tormore
It was taken not for him at all but for tenants and when the school board came in the people were too far from the school and it was too few to send a schoolmaster to them and therefore they had to lift the people out of there and let them go but we got the offer of the place again from Tormore if we would take it
No some of them would not and some would
Yes
No see Appendix A
XXIV
I do not know
I would wish to do that as I have come and I should be very glad if I could do it
There is another thing that is troubling us very muchtrawling herring in our northern lochs
I believe it is keeping down the people of this island as much as anything else that they are suffering
Yes
Yes
Some of them could not stock it
The place which they had was heavy enough upon them
Again the schoolrates are very heavy upon us
It would keep six cows if we could winter them
Thirteen sheep
One horse
I pay  s
Yes
Last year they were s d
No there was s d of doctors money besides that
We are leaving that to more intelligent individuals than ourselves
When they are taking the small fish along with the big fish The young fish are killed while they are useless the young fish being what we put to the fishing next year
I refer to herring
There was not much done on our coast until within the past two years especially last year it spoiled them altogether
From the south some from the north and some from the east coast
No the merchants are very good to us
If they were not we should be very ill off
Not that I am aware of
Yes
No
No
I have nothing else to say but I was expected to speak for the little township that I referred toDrennoch
I have not much to say about it
They were complaining of being confined as others were
They have only got holdings worth  and that was heavy enough upon us
It is small enough for them
No they have not much
They have a little
No not since they got it
Throughout the district here and there
They fish
Yes and in bringing seaweed ashore
The following is the statement on behalf of Aird  There are nineteen lots in this township all of them subdivided some to the extent of being held by four persons
It was stated that the summing of stock was sometimes above and sometimes below the fixed estimate
It would appear that nearly all are both able and willing to take larger holdings and pay the rents
They complain that the mill stopped about twelve years ago because there was little or no grain to grind on account of the soil having run out through frequent cropping
With regard to hill pasture it was stated that many years ago the township held the lands of Carradale and Point of Sleat in addition to what they now hold but that these two places were taken from them without consulting their wishes
Another complaint was that about thirtyfoul years ago a loan of public money was granted to the township for draining and that interest on this loan still continues to be charged
It was proposed and agreed that Alexander MGillivray and Ronald Robertson be appointed delegates from Aird
Yes
Want of land want of a place from which we can extract a living
We have no means of living
All the land on which we live belongs to the tacksman Mr MKinnon of Kyle
We have no security for our tenure but the day we refuse to work for him we may be turned off
We offered rent to him at first but he would not take it and now it is the rule that we have to work for him any day he requests us
Every time he needs us we have to work and that is often
Some years it may come to sixty days and others to forty
We were thinking if we could get a bit of the land that was about us we we would pay for it land on which our forefathers were long ago
Yes
If he requires our services at that time we must needs leave somebody in our place to do the work
Yes
No
Yes
About one acre
We are not allowed to keep a cow but we do it
We feed the cow with the produce of the acre combined with what we get by halffoot cultivation elsewhere
No
Six families who have land and four who have no land at allfiftyseven souls altogether
They work for him but they do not pay rent
No
Yes
Yes
I have a lot but it is not a lot
It was taken from me but my name is in the books yet
The schoolhouse of which the former delegate spoke was built on the half lot which I had and the best part of the lot was taken from methe part in which I used to plant potatoes which I have been doing fer twenty years without changing seed
There was no other part of my lot cultivable except gennett what was built upon for the schoolhouse
The schoolhouse was placed on it and other land was promised me but I never got it and what was left of the lot to me
There are three gates on the schoolhouse wall
There are two gates to the roadway
The school enclosure was built so near to the sea that the people going that way cannot pass except through the school ground and they break the wall for the purpose
It used to be a place for sheltering boats in both boats of the natives and boats of strangers and now they cannot save a boat at all
 of rent
That is not a big rent if one had value for it
I can plant two bushels of seed oats in it and a barrel of potatoes  and I have to carry half of the soil I need to cover the seaweed with which I manure the ground
The greatest depth in any two square yards of it is not  inchesthe substratum being rock
I have nothing to say about these further than what is stated in the paper which was sent in for them but they are fishermen altogether
It is as follows  Unto the Honourable the Royal Commissioners for the Highlands and Islands of Scotland the following petition from the crofterfishing population resident at Dunan humbly showeth the grievances they have to complain of
First the amount of ground they at present possess is insufficient to maintain the population for three months in the year
Second a part of land was taken from us some years ago to form another croft for which rent is now paid but no allowance has been made to us for it
Instead of a reduction being made on our rents they were raised
Third There are as many cottars crowded on the land as there are crofters
Fourth We have to buy all the seaware we put on our land from the large tenant farmers
Fifth The ground is so poor that there hasnt been a stone of meal made from all the corn grown on it for the last twenty years
SixthThat there is no place of refuge for our fishing boats
Yes  we always pay for the seaweed but we have not paid for this years seaweed yet
Sometimes they let us off without payment
I know of no place about more capable of it
Branches of it
Yes the most convenient place about for the purpose
A quay extending out and a breakwater at the end
About  yards would do or maybe less than that
Yes but I lost my nets at Loch Hourn and I was only three nights at that fishing
I took too much herring
There is a burn between us and the neighbouring township and when the burn is in flood it is very dangerous for the children in the neighbouring township to cross to school
Their parents must meet them coming or going and when the school skails I cannot tell how many tracks they have through my cultivated land
Yes
Yes
The factor granted us wood for the purpose and the people were not able even to bring wood to the place or to erect the bridge
Because they can only get from the factor heavy trees to span the burn and they have to lay stobs across this and cover them with earth
We were both idle and lazy about it
We are not complaining
Yes it was only done today
That is the reason of the names not being sent in
We have to complain of the smallness of our holdings
We are planting potatoes during the last fiftysix years and if we sow oats in any part of the ground we have no means of planting potatoes and even should we sow oats the deer will destroy them
Yes
Only three cows no horse  and we are forbidden by the factor to keep sheep but we are keeping a few all the same
We could keep about two hundred or three hundred on the township
Up to twenty each
There are eight crofts
No good in the world from it
We might be as well without it
 a lot
No we could not get as much off our lots as would feed one cow and some of these lots have two or three families settled on them
They eat the crop at night
No we did not but even should we do so we would not be the better of it
No
No
Yes
We would be glad to do that
Yes
Not above three quarters of a mile
Yes we are forbidden during the hunting season
We would require it all sometimes
They planted the school too far from us
The children have a wild moor to cross to get to it
Two and a half miles
No but we have the worst road
Yes
If the school would be half the way on the hill
Yes it would be an equal distance from each township
The factor
I do not know
In Dunan
Yes
Yes the storms damaged our boats
Not that we heard of
Yes we could get plenty herring if we could cure them and make use of them
Yes
Yes the lots which we have are too small and we have spoiled them owing to the frequency of our cultivation of them
I myself remember getting crops very much better than we can get today out of them and the reason for that is that our holdings are so small see Appendix A
XIII that we leave to cultivate them entirely every year and if we dont do that the crop will not feed our summing of stock and even after all the crop is not sufficient for that purpose
We are out of pocket  or  for feeding for our stock in addition to what the lot grows
Besides that none of us can get as much seed from our corn as will sow our land
We had no potatoes at all last year
We had to buy them all
We had to buy seed oats last year also
Other years we might not be as ill off as that
Again we are at the back of the country and we have no roadway
We are four miles from this place and this is the nearest place from which we can get our supplies
This is the nearest place at which steamers call
Drainage money was laid upon usI dont remember how far back
Those drains then burst and I had then to lift them and relay them or the ground would be worthless
But I got no compensation for that and I myself am paying the drainage interest which was originally laid upon me
Before my time
I believe it was thirtyfive years ago
Yes at first but then they burst and they were useless until I reopened them
Yes it is the better for it to the present day as long as the outflow is kept clear
Though the land is dear we have to complain we have not got enough of it
We have to keep a pair of horses and we have not got enough work for our horses to do on these lots and we have to keep them all the same
We cannot work a cart or any other wheeled conveyance until we get a roadway
Yes
Thirteen crofts
Five cows twentyfour sheep and a pair of horses
 s besides rates
Yes because of the badness of the soil owing to the frequency of its cultivation
I have no doubt the land at first would yield sufficient to feed the stock
We have to buy all the meal that our families requiresee Appendix A
XIII
No we cannot even get as much seed oats as will sow our land
I believe six acres
Yes
We would have nothing then to feed our stock with
The cows are better for the ground than sheep
We would require double as much as we have to keep our pair of horses in work
Yes
Yes
Yes
I would prefer to give double the rent for such a croft than to be dealing with such a croft as I have for I could then leave out a part of it
We have to complain also of the deer
Yes
There are twelve lots in the Blackpark
These lots were portioned out six years ago but we were kept back for a whole year after I myself had expended s on the drainage of my lot and when the time came when I should sow my seed I was prevented from so doing as the tacksmans lease of it had not run out
We have no grazing nor right to seaweed he counting us as thieves when we are upon the shore
I am the third individual mentioned by Mr Logan who was denied seaweed
The tacksman when we went to the seashore for weed came with his ground officer to prevent us
There were three of usJohn MLean John MLeod and myself
I am for the past five years working very hard and with the assistance even of my family in the sort of place which I have I could not yet manage to sow a boll of oats in it even without potatoes at all
Every time I have cultivated it I am going to a depth of eighteen inches with the pick and spade
I built a house upon it and spent a good deal upon it and I asked that the factor should give me some assurance that I would be left in the lotof some hold of my own houseand I did not get that
We are without glazing for a cow or a goat but we could graze a pet sheep on the grass or on the lotnot outside the lotswe cannot keep a pet there
I have not much more to say
My hardships have been told and that is all my neighbours have to say likewise
Yes
We were throughout the place here
My father was twentythree years in Keppoch in that township that was cleared but the rest of my people are down about here
Off the tack of Corrie
It was a practically useless piece which nothing green was growing upon just a bit of moss called Blackpark and very properly so
We pay  for this park among us
Yes
The first thing I have to tell is that our holdings are too small and that they are bad
One of them is peat moss of unknown depth
I speak of our arable land
Again we can only cultivate half of our lots
At the time of the year when it happens to be wet and rainy our beasts cannot go to the upper part of our lots the land is so deep and boggy
We have sometimes had to take our cattle out of the bog with ropes
Then our grazing is soft ground also
Not an eighth part of it can yield grass the soil being black and peaty
Much of it cannot be trodden on by our cattle at times
Again there are fiftythree years since it was laid out in lots and it was then made into twelve lots
Some of the original occupiers of these twelve lots left the country and went abroad
There are three of our lots again divided into two halves and one is divided into seven portions and in these lots that are so divided the subdivisions of them are occupied by families who pay rent
Then there are six other families in the township who pay no rent at all
There are  souls in our township altogether
When it was first made into lots each lot was   of rent and now the rent is   s for the past ten years see Appendix A
XIII
Besides that we pay for seaware s a year and I have here a letter which I got from the factor when he was raising the rent
Yes that was the first notice and the whole of the township the same way
I had no other expectation
I could not say I would not pay it or that would be the result and to every one else in the township
Yes every one of them so far as I know
Yes they do so in a sense
The landlord has got Pabbay in his own possession
It was families from another part of the estate
Yes
Besides that there was a paupers house built upon that lot
On one of these lots there are two families who were brought from Suishnish and the subdivision of the other lots is due to the natural increase of the family
I would like to know if there was any possibility of getting a harbour of refuge for us in Broadford and our township is also wanting to get more land and that they should have fixity of tenure so that the landlord could not evict unless there would be a very good reason for it
Twenty years
I have been twelve and a half years at Broadford
I was
I was a parochial teacher
I declined at first to become a delegate but at the urgent request of several of the other people at a public meeting I came forward
I am not unwilling however to give evidence from any knowledge I have and I have jotted down the differentthings gathered from what others say and from what I know myself
As to their holdings the average size is from  to  acres with outrun
The  rents for these crofts are from  to  On such holdings the people become poorer and poorer and would require at least  acres and pasture for forty sheep
The soil becomes deteriorated in consequence of being turned every year for a number of years and the rainfall of the country is so great that even the manure in summer is washed away
I have observed the rainfall for eight or nine years and in some years it has been as high as  inches
Rain fell on  days in the year  The holdings are only held at the will of the landlord or rather his factor because the people dont see and dont know the landlord
The dwellings were built at the crofters expense and until lately no compensation was allowed when leaving or being removed
The late factor Tormore told me he introduced a rule upon the estate that compensation would be allowed for crofters houses but the rule I was told was observed more in the breach than in the fulfilment
The rents are considered high owing to the small extent of croft but the crofters would be quite willing and more able to pay three times as much for a croft three times as large
My neighbour Donald Mackinnon Harrapool had his rent raised three times on one or two occasions after improvements
The sheep runs are mostly all the  result of evictions but not quite recently
The farmers consider the crofters a nuisance and prevent them from taking away seaweed from the shores on the farm although by their leases they have only a claim on the seaweed required for their own use
I was an emigration agent for New Zealand and got six families and one or two single people to go
Ministers or factors did not encourage emigration
Those who left were in better circumstances than the average
They got free passages and their fares paid to the port of embarkation
If they had or could get good crofts they would not leave others wished to go but were so sunk in debt that their effects would not pay their debts and outfit
As to population nearly  live within  square miles or nearly  to the square mile between Broadford bridge and Lussay bridge huddled on small crofts and driven away from their former holdings
They are mostly engaged in fishing
I have been clerk and treasurer of the school board since the passing of the Education Act until last June
No encouragement is given to clever boys
I can give information on this head if necessary
As a great many of the crofters are on the verge of pauperism they do not now consider it so great a shame as formerly to go over to that denomination
The pauper children are the best educated in the parish as the parish pays for them
Rates are pressing
In the  last abstract issued by the Parochial Board in  the parish was assessed for nearly  and the registered paupers only got  I produce the abstract
The proprietor charges for the seaware and when the ship freighted with potatoes for the destitute was in the bay the neighbouring sheep farmer kept from the crofters the ware with which they intended to plant the potatoes
The people wish to get larger holdings and permanent tenure fixed rents by land court or otherwise but are not in favour of leases as they fear the Greeks even bringing gifts
I have it from those present here who told me
l have no doubt it is the truth
John MLean Harrapool John MLeod Harrapool William Fraserthese three people checked for taking it away
The tacksman of CorrieMr Murchison
Nobody that I am aware of
Quite so
I was parochial schoolmaster
There is no other body whom the board could get to do it
I was returning officer and then I became clerk and treasurer
It is not uncommon
I may say that there is about  per cent and I should say there was then  per cent but then we had not the accommodation we have now
We were huddling seventy scholars into a room  by  feet
I had often to tear out the windows to allow the scholars to get a breath of fresh air and to stand at the door to get a breath of it myself
Scholars had to travel  miles and to bring in stones as they could not get seats to sit upon in the school
There is no pressure put upon the children
I think if the school board did their duty the children would attend
They are very poor and in the winter season when they get  their clothes wet it is not easy for them to come back again
Only in one township and it was rather a quarrel between two townships as to where the school should be located
Sutherlandshire
I think he was quite wrong
I have had children from the south and children from the north and the children from the north when they came to be advanced and got a classical education were not in any way behind the others
Plenty and read it and write it too and use it occasionally in the school but not as a class subject
When they are beginning and I show them the similarity of certain words
I find it very useful especially when infants come into the school in their first two years before they understand English
I find it  very usefid in the discipline because there is a sort of bond of union between the scholars and myself
Twothirds
Not very many
The Chronicle is the paper which is generally read
We sometimes get a sight of Glasgow and Dundee papers
I suppose about a dozen or two
Yes
Yes
One chief reason is that we have a system of cram now and we have not the same scope for teachers that we had formerly
Wre have to make up to a certain age and  it is the cow that  milks which is looked to and I must prepare for the day of inspection
Specific subjects do not pay
I would if I had the time to devote to them
I am not able to devote the time otherwise I would be very glad to do so
In that particular year
We first had a rate of d to secure the grant
Then we had a rate of d but since then it has reached Is d till last year when it reached s
Od
I cannot say
I do not pay it on my house
I believe it is Is ld on tenants
There was  for management and  to the doctor and  for some arrears by the auditor
Likely
I cannot say  I have nothing to do with the parochial board
Yes showing how heavy the rates are
I am not reflecting on the parochial board
I must be silent on that point when I do not know
I do for the want of a sufficient staff but it would not pay to keep a staff
Certainly
More children get it but I cannot say that the efficiency is greater
I cannot say we turn out more good scholars
I come from Bonar Bridge
They are far better clothed on the east coast
Three acres in this county are not to be compared with an acre there
The rainfall in Sutherlandshire is  inches the rainfall here is  inches
I think so
It is a great drawback to us in teaching perhaps one of our chief  drawbacks that we have to teach English in the earliest stages
If Gaelic were made a specific subject when a child came to Standard IV V or VI we could then draw larger grants and have something for the time we spent in teaching English in the earlier stages
That is my expectation that it would be a mistake
If we had the time it would be quite erroneous provided the school board could give us the time for specific subjects
A good few but a good many are Lowlanders who have come of late
Because our teachers go south
My head pupil teacher has gone to a Glasgow school
The Highlanders are going south aud the Lowlanders are coming north
My opinion is that there were mora schools under Government inspection in the south before the passing of the Education Act than in the north
In the north schools were mostly kept up by the Ladies Association and the Church
A great many pupil teachers who did not hold certificates came north and of course they arc inferior to the teachers who hold certificates
I hold a certificate myself
Most certainly
Yes
As a matter of fact he does
I wish to say that there were six or seven cottars who came forward and said they were upon the tacksmans ground that they had very little ground and they thought their case should be brought forward and I promised to state it before you
In regard to the case of the cottars they were for a very long time on Mackinnon of Kyleakins farm  the whole of them I represent
They have about one acre or one and a half acre of ground and sometimes six of them get a cows grazing and I am told by some of them that they work thirty or forty days in the year for that
Each family has a cow
There is no money taken
Some years they do more and some years they do less
Not merely for the stance they have bits of ground attached
Some years they dont work at all and some years they work thirty or forty days
I dont see it either
They are wishing to get more land and if the crofts be extended that it should not be upon their place
From s d to s for the best labouring men
The work cannot be got here at all but at any work that is given them they get from s to s or s to s a week
He is a particularly good labourer and he gets s d per day
s to s
 I think s it is very hard work
I am perfectly so
I dont think so
No
Yes
The parochial school was shifted at the passing of the Act and two districts were combined and consequently the attendance is greater now
Yes by all who were present
There were some of them absent however
Most part of the inhabitants
A good many of them were at work
What I have to tell is that we have been located upon a poor piece of grounda piece that was taken from another townshipand it was never cultivated until the set came to it which included my father
They had it for  a piece and there was no work ever made upon it except such work as we ourselves did
I am at this day paying including rates and rent up to  There is s of rent and my rates come up to s
The ground is such that I have had to expend  in seed for it over and above the seed I got out of it
I dont remember seeing the ground left uncultivated
It is turned every year and it is not worth cultivating it for the support of man
Its only value is to feed our stock
The stock is only one cow and a horse and these eat up all the grass upon our lots
We have to tether our cows on the cultivated land
The only outrun we have for them is a bit of bad hill pasture full of rocks
The most of it is bare rock
I did not cook a meal for my family out of all that grew on my holding since the new year
Whenever the family come of age that they can work they must leave to earn money to support their parents
Wre are getting supplies from merchants on credit until the money is earned and if we had sufficient ground that would supply us with what we need in the way of food we should consider ourselves well off
All that we earn from end to end of the year we spend in food and our holdings are so small that even if we had them for nothing we could not make a living out of them
I have not altogether two acres of arable land
I dont know what else to say
Not all at once
There was some improvement made on our township at the time of the destitution
We were getting meal for the work
s
Tormore the first year he became factor laid s upon each croft without coming to see the ground
We just got a letter from the factor
There was no cause assigned only he said the ground had been valued by a valuator but we never saw him
No
Five years ago Ive got clippings of a bad hill pasture for sheep and that is s to each of us which makes up the hill rent now
Six hundred was the summing that was assigned to it but we have not got four hundred upon it yet
We are not able to buy the stock
Thirty
Yes
Yes but many of them have only one or two and others have none at aH and some have a full share
No
It is the best bargain we have
The ground will not return to us the oat seed we put into it
There is no hiring
Only that when my spring work is over I send him to the hill until the winter comes
As the manure we use is seaweed we will not manage without a horse
Yes some of us do
Should I be for selling the grazing I have for my cow I could not get a person that would give s a year
There is no such place at all in the parish
To get a place out of which I could support my family
Yes if I could take it
I was born in the place
It is seventy years since my father came to it
My father used before the ground became so poor when it was in good heart to make  or  or  bolls of meal out of it and plenty potatoes
No except the tacksmans land
We are marching with a tack
Mr MKinnon Kyle and Kinloch on the other side
MKinnon Kyle had Kinloch also at that time
No but the township next to oursLower Breakish was deprived of pasture
We were settled in the part of the pasture which was taken from Lower Breakish
Yes
Yes and I for one
I dont know
Yes I believe so
Yes we would have no hardships so long as we are in health if it were not for our debts
I am in hopes as my family are getting stronger
I do drystone mason work
The poor people cannot give me wages
If I make s a day I will be contented
Sometimes I get more than I can overtake and at other times I get none at all
I would take a croft at  to  rent
I dont know that it would but it would be very good along with our own help
There were some in our township that could not take big croftswidows and othersand we did not speak on that subject before Ive left home
Yes
My son is only eighteen years of age and the last letter I had from him was from Germany and he is helping me there
On a steamer sailing from Glasgow to Hamburgh
I would not like to do that in my old age
I cannot understand their minds on that
Yes
The name of our township is Harrapool the meaning of which is  the tail end of a quagmire and it is there our lots are laid out
Yes
Yes quite
I am paying rent in Harrapool thirtyeight or forty years and in my early recollection my father was taking out of the ground that I have now the wherewith to enable him to rear eight or nine of a family without the necessity of buying
There was good reason for that
The township was taking into cultivation a part of the pasture when it was getting foggy which enabled them to get food sufficient for themselves and their family as the ground was strong
The ground officer was living in our township and he reported to the factor that we were by this way of cultivation spoiling the grassboth Sculamus and ourselves
The ground officer then came to the Sculamus people and told them that they could not take in any part of the grazing as they were spoiling the cows
The people told him that what they had for grazing over and above what they cultivated would do for their stock all summer
The ground officer then went to the factor and told him this and the factor replied that if the people had as much pasture land over and above what they required for the grazing of their cattle he would find use for it
He then placed four families who had been cleared from Suishnish upon the Sculamus grazing
The grazing of the two townships is now spoiled with deer and rabbits
The factor was Mr Ballingall
Yes the deer from the same forest
The deer are through the whole district
No but any one who will complain the answer is  I myself will take your holding
The rabbits are causing us great loss
Several hundreds of them were killed this winter upon the grazing of our township and the neighbouring township
They are killed by the shooting tenant
Not a penny
Sends them away in boxes
No not onenot even a foot
It is only three or four years since they commenced to be a burden upon us
They were not so numerous but they are now destructive
They came from Sleat
No we are not aware
The gamekeepers tell us that we dare not kill them
We dont try to kill them
We know that quite well how to kill them with snares and traps
No they are eating the corn of our two townships
We did not ask him
It would take a mile or fhree quarters of a mile
That would take three miles
I made a great deal of work on my lot in the way of improving
One year I opened  yards of drains and closed them up with stones
A few years after that my rent was raised and my rent was raised before then on account of the drainage money I got
This last money rise was d or d in the 
My rent was raised s about twenty years after I had opened these drains
It was Tormore who raised it
I was not counting the drainage money that was laid upon me as an increase of rent as I was to be relieved of it at the end of twenty years  but instead of my rent being reduced at the end of twenty years I had the s added to it and the drainage money kept up and paving poor rates and other rates upon the sum totaL Any one can understand that peaty ground must be getting exhausted as the ground was formerly peat mosses and a place that was never created for the habitation of man
We are for having increased holdings on which we could live
Though we have a few cows left us we cannot take as much cut of the ground as would keep them alive
Besides we spend three rents in supporting our families and cattle
Not only that but we have to buy almost all the seed oats that we have to sow
Another thing I have to say
I had a brother in the township of Sculamus
He was at work in Glenelg and died there
He left nine of a family
A few years after his death they were wanting to evict his widow and her children
I went security for her years rent in order to keep her in possession
The next year she was evicted
She was obliged to leave without getting compensation
It was I who paid the rent for her and I got  back
She was a number of years occupying a halfruined house with her nine children the youngest of them being a year old and the oldest seventeen
Her son bought a stirk
She dared not build a place near her house where she could keep it
At last she got a bit of Breakish and she is there still but her children have left her
Some of them went to Australia see Appendix A
XIII
They made a living of it wherever they went but she is very poor indeed
It is one son that is supporting her with his earnings
She got very little assistance
It was the parish that built the house for her
If she did I do not remember it
It was myself who helped her most
No for I got  back of the rent which I paid for her
No
I gave  to the factor and it was only   she was due
She had very little stock
She had  not a summing
A farmer who came from Suishnish
It is now occupied by two
She was not owing any rent or arrears and it was one of the Suishnish farmers who was placed in her stead
Yes
Yes
Well I had some delicacy in accepting to be a delegate because I was afraid I would be hunted afterwards for giving evidence but I see there is a guarantee from Lord Macdonald and the factor and I just took courage to come forward
We have general grievances in the township that I belong to
I think it is a great grievance the small holdings
That is the main grievance and want of security of tenure and want of compensation in case of removals
The rents are high but are considered high owing to the smallness of the holdings
These are the main points I think
There are grievances connected with cottars being rented who are on the crofts of other parties and no reduction of rent
It does
It is not on my croft but it is in the township
Well it is likely
It was Tormore who imposed the rents on the cottars here on the lands of the crofters
No there was no allowance
Not that I know of
The money we got for improving was added to the rents at the expiry of the time that we were allowed to pay the interest for it
Yes
It is still going on added to the rents and we are assessed for It in connection with the rent
It stands as rent now
I think thirtytwo years or so
There were twenty years allowed to pay it
We are paying for seaware
To the proprietor or to the adjoining tenant who can sell some
Well we have a little but it is not sufficient
Those who have a little of their own will do with s worth yearly
No it is not about the highest
Those who require it require the value of about s or s
I think there is no scarcity here but only they have to pay for it
There are game and rabbits in our grazing
They are
They are always increasing except when the sportsmen are after them
No because we are tenants at will
We cannot protect ourselves
There is no fixity of tenure
No we dont even dare to trap them
If we did we might be put in jail if there was room for us
I dont know of any of late but that is the Macpherson goodwill of the proprietor and the factor
Well removal was carried on in my time on a very extensive scale
Perhaps it is too far back to speak of but in this parish there were a few cases of those who were thrown out and evicted
I think there is a woman outside at the door who can give evidence of that
She was a widow woman with two children and she was thrown out of her holding without any rent or arrears
She was at Breakish
There was no reason
Yes she is supported by her son now
She has two sons and one is in the army and the other has to support his mother
Upwards of ten years ago
I do not think it
Yes supposing I had the croft I had myself gratis from the proprietor I would prefer to have three times as much and pay for it becauee I could bring a living out of it
Well there is plenty of ground in the parish only it is occupied by the tacksmen
It could not be expected that crofters would pay for tacks that were in the market for some time back and parties declaring they were ruined by these tacks
They would pay a reasonable rent imposed by a valuator
It seems the tacksmen are not able to pay when they are willing to get clear of their tacks
Of course not without capital
The tacksmen are men of capital
It would be easier to have large holdings than to be paying it to the merchants here and there
Well I would strive to stock it too
I think the factor would advance the money on good security
Yes
Yes she came to my house this morning
Sixty years
Yes or I should not have come
I was reluctant to come
Yes and I agree with him in every word and it was truth he was saying
I will tell you how I got on all that time in the place in which I was
I was born in Sleat and I was five years of age when the land was laid out into lots first and the crofters in the township in which I was for more than ten years after it was made into lots were removed in order to give place to Major Macdonald Waternish
That is what brought me to Torrin
These people had no place to go to
They were crowded into other townships
My father then had no place at all There was no vacant place in Sleat for him
Linigarry and Kilbeg
My father could get no place in Sleat till the factor came to Strath to collect the rents
He then evicted a man from Torrin and placed my father in his holding
His croft was then  of rent
The surveyor came to value the land and he made the valuation  s
Then there were ten of the crofters in the township complained that their lots were not good enough and at the end of the year the factor came to enlarge their holdings at the expense of the townships grazingthe best grazing we hadand we got nothing for that
We got no reduction in our rents
Then poor rates came to be assessed upon us which raised the rents again
We then got money for drains
I got  and I was paying s d of interest upon it and we were promised that we would be relieved of it at the end of twenty years
That is two years since and we are paying it still
Then Macdonald Tormore came and he gave us the worst blow of all
He raised the rents and he laid rent upon cottars in each township who had not an inch of ground beyond what their houses were built upon
s d was added for the drains making  s d and it is now  s  besides all the other assessments that follow
It comes to  The assessment was s for poor rates and s for school rates and s for road money
That is all except s of doctors money
The poor rate is about s d in the  and the school rate is d in the tenants share
Yes
Between  and 
I behove  or  today
I would not get  for it thirty years ago
If it be a good stirk they may get  or 
Yes
About forty years ago we would get s or s for a wedder
We would get  for it today
About s a week
Between s and  
Yes it is making the burden heavier on the tenant
I have no scholars at alL To those who have scholars I believe the burden is very heavy upon them paying so much in the  for them besides school fees and their children going naked and barefooted to school because they cannot clothe them
I do not think that the schooling they are getting nowadays is better in any way than the schooling they were getting in my early recollection and we were in days gone by getting schooling gratis
All the schooling I got was under a parish schoolmaster and our school I believe did not cost more than 
The landlord
I was not paying at all
The schoolmaster was paid off the parish
The scholars who came on well with arithmetic and grammar and Latin and such branches were paying a little
At that time in winter and spring I believe our school would average sixty scholars
I would rather pay for the road for it is passing my door and it is very convenient to me
There were eight in the township in which I was
There were six at any rate in Kilbeg
Two of those who were put out of Kilbeg found a place on the mainland
Tormore I think and more besides
Yes
Yes they are beside each other
No
I am not sure but it was twelve lots
Some were sent to Sculamus some to Breakish some to Sleat
I dont remember but it is ten lots that were in it
Our minister had these places last
I am not sure whether it was six or eight lots but there were more than that of families
Only a shepherd and a servant with the minister
Yes
Yes it was occupied by crofters
Eight I think
It was eight lots
I believe there were more than that of families in it
About fifteen years ago
Yes two years after I came to Strath fiftyeight years ago
I think it would be in  or thereabout
Yes
Seven or eight at any rate
About twenty years ago
Yes  it marches with the township in which I was
There was no family at all in it
Mr Macdonalds mother was living there
Ostaig was surrounded by Linigary and Kilbeg which were cleared as I stated before
Yes
Four or five at any rate
He has not Ferrindonald
He has Kilbeg Ostaig Linigary Dalveil Glencruig and Gillen
He has Sleat from sea to sea
It is long since I was that way and I cannot say
I am not aware that there is any one paying rent unless to himself
Yes
Macpherson was the earliest one I can recollect
No
The present is the ninth factor under whom I have been and the landlord is the fifth
Yes  there were three in Morsaig and Morsaig was added to Ord
I suspect there were some of them who were in arrears of rent
Some went to Australia and some to other lots that were vacant and then the remainder were cleared off
Yes
Yes as well doing as any in the parish
Yes as welldoing as in the parish
I cannot say
Mr Ballingall
Yes it was the trustees who sent Baliingall there
Norman MLeod who was in Scalpa
Mr Scott Drynoch had it and then the minister got it
I remember hearing that said
Six miles
I am not aware of that
Macpherson was the factor under whom the first evictions took place
Maxwell was the next
He did not remove any
Only those that were cleared off by him from Carradale when he added the township to his own tack
Fiftyeight years ago
 between rent and taxes
 s
I have six cows and two horses and between forty and fifty sheep that is the summing
Arithmetic  I can read English and Gaelic
It is worse
In the school in which I was they would get English grammar and Latin taught and there is no word of that in the present schools  and they could get Greek too
The present schoolhouse cost for a little pimple of a woman
Our female teacher is the only female teacher in our parish
I hear those who have children in the school say they would prefer a male teacher
It is dear upon me
The feeding of my stock and my family and providing with seed costs me up to  per annum beside the crop
I do not know how other peoples crops come on but I can tell about my own
Yes
Yes on our own shore
Some of them are not satisfied
They are taking seaware from others
They are taking seaware from the minister and Mr Bower
I am not aware that it is stopped yet
Yes many a time
I never was obliged to take seawaro from anybody else or any other place
I had a full share myself
At Breakish principally
Yes their lots are larger than is required for the amount of stock they have
Yes very much more so
I am not aware I ever paid a penny to the minister for seaware
I never heard that the minister asked payment
When Mr Bower came first the people of our township offered to pay for the seaware and he would not accept it and the people then took the seaware
He uses it a little but he does not need  much
Yes
We have two shepherds
Ourselves
Two or three of our own number are elected each year as managers
About Martinmas time
Every thing we have to sell is sold by that time
 per share
I have also to say the deer are troubling us very much
They are spoiling our crofts and we must get protection against them or else we cannot stand it
I was paying s of dog tax to enable me to keep them off
The shooting tenants gamekeeper came to the back of my house and shot that dog about  yards off
The dog was lying beside my wife and daughter who were lifting potatoes at the time
The Armstrongs who had the shootings at Strolamus
They had the shooting over our hill too
Robert Macgregor
No I complained to the Fiscal about it and the Fiscal could not recover payment of the value of the dog from the sportsman because Tormore said I had no right to keep a dog
Yes I put the case in the hands of the Fiscal and the answer I got from the Fiscal was that the factor was saying I had no right to keep a dog so nothing was done
Mr Mackmnon the former factor paid us during two years
Fourteen or fifteen years before Tormore came
Yes and Tormore woidd answer me when I complained to him If you are not satisfied with what you have throw it up
The factor is promising that at any rate
The stone dyke would last longer
Neither of them would make much difference to the arable land
It would be very useful but it would be a very long fence
There are mountains in it
Six miles I think
It would indeed be useful to have it
Another thing that is causing us very much inconvenience is the fact that two burns run through our grazing and we have to cross these continually and they are not bridged and the beginning of this spring one of my neighbours was found drowned in one of them
I could only say that it is those who have the smallest holdings who complain most
A good deal of money came to this parish for the use of poor people and because I had a whole croft I did not get a penny of it
I am not a fisherman at all
Yes I was constrained even to go
The whole people of the township
Without any
They are for having their holdings increasedthose who can take such increased holdings
Another thing of which they complain is that the land which they have is refusing to yield crop
Though we sow seed we do not reap and besides that the deer are eating our corn
Years before the deer would not come upon us until the corn was filling but now they come to eat the braird and the tops of the potatoes
Yesterday for the first time my neighbour had a piece of clover sown and when he rose in the morning the deer were browsing on it
We have need to be protected from the deer but we are promised such protection
We never got any compensation for loss caused to us by the deer
We had to stand it ourselves and besides that even though our land was refusing to yield its crop Tormore the factor raised our rents and the mill in which we had been grinding our corn for the past forty years is now idle and has been so for twenty years back
Besides that the one years seed will not sow our crofts the next year
We have to buy seed oats in Greenock
If I did not get credit from a merciful man who is there my lot for the most part of it would be uncultivated
I have nothing further to say but that the land will not pay itself
Our arable land will not yield as much as will feed the stock we have
We have to feed them with oatmeal and with Indian meal at the end of the year and that expense is eating up the value of the beasts and we must needs pay Lord Macdonalds rent to the uttermost penny at the end of the year at any rate
Now what is to happen to us if our earnings fail us
How can we afford to pay the meal merchant
When I was a young man I was at work earning wages and I was not troubling any man but now I am become old I cannot follow the occupation in which I was making a living before
My savings in these times have supported me hitherto but are now exhausted
I have nothing now but the little stock which is on my ground and when that will be exhausted I do not know what to do unless I get some enlargement of my holding while the stock is left to me to keep me up during the few years I have yet to live and that will not be very many
I have not been such a long time in the place in which I now am but as to the other things that happened there is one here who is older than me and he knows better than me and can tell better about these thingsthe things that have happened
Neil Nicolson
It marches with our hill pasture
The deer come and trespass over our hill pasture
About three miles
There are two miles at any rate in our march with the deer forest
We were never deprived of hill pasture
Yes the factor promised that with our own assistance he would protect us from the deer
We were promised that it would be up by the end of summer
A wire fence on the top of our own dykes
I dont know exactly
Yes
He has provided stobs for us and he is to provide wire
Yes
I believe near Broadford here
We have to drive them home ourselves and sink the stobs in the ground
Of course I cannot say
Those who have horses can tell better for I have no conveyance of the kind
Well the stobs are all right I believe but I really dont know whether the wires have come forward or not
They would be got for no other intention
I believe in the main that he will stand to his promise
I have no occasion to doubt it
No damages whatever but I may state a widow woman in the neighbourhood has got  s of late for all she sustained
She has a half croft
I believe there are seven or eight acres but I am not very sure
I have overheard it of late
I believe it to be true from the source it came
Lord Macdonalds
Yes
Longer than I myself but they are getting more numerous
Yes for as long as I have been in the neighbourhood
Yes complaints were made but no recompense was given
Yes but Mr Mackinnon of Corrie the factor was giving us about  a year to help us to pay a watchman over them at night
That is done away with
I dont recollect for I was not all the time in the country
I had to go to employment to make my living
It was promised last summer and last harvest time
Stobs with wire on the top of our own dyke
Three wires I believe was the intention so that he believed the deer would not jump over
Eight feet nine inches seven feet or eight feet anyway
No only four lots of the arable land on the top next the hill
Yes
No
Yes on Saturday I saw them feeding on my neighbours clover
It is on the croft he is labouring for his crops
Yes
We dont look to that but one thing is we are prevented from being seen upon the hill the time of the shooting by the huntsmenthe leaseholders of the deer
No if they go round the time of the hunting
I believe it would but if it were round the arable ground we would require no more
Watch them at night the time of the crop filling
That is the time they used to come on of late years even last year and thus they are eating the braird of the corn as it comes up
We dare not
I would be evicted out of the place for the first thing
They could not hang me I believe
I believe it is against the law of the landlord whether it is against the law of the land I cannot tell
I pay  s for a quarter of the lot at this time
It did not used to be so high till Tormore raised it and then when the rent was raised the other assessments were rising along with it and that makes the burden heavy
Just one cow and a half I may say
A cow and a twoyearold are allowed me
I am not allowed to keep a horse
Well there are sheep I believe
About fifty on the lot and the quarter of fifty will be about twelve
That is what is allowed me
It is a club stock
I have to stand the consequences of the loss besides
Yes but he must do it early in the morning and have not a foot on their grounds after they come out
No the rest of the year they are not so hard upon us
They were that hard upon us
We need ropes to keep the thatch on our houses and we spin that rope out of heather
There was a neighbour of mine on the hill for this purpose and a huntsman came up to him and threatened to shoot him if he would be seen there again even on their own heather that they were paying rent forfor fear of molesting the muirfowl
We had to stand all this
We were afraid we would be prosecuted if we should speak out because it was a great boon to the landlord of course
We have stood many a thing but we were feared to speak out and whatever may be done we must stand it or else prepare ourselves for the worst
No
Yes
No they were not influenced by any one outside of themselves
All the inhabitants of my township
I heard them and understood it
Yes indeed
Not much
In our townships we have no peat moss
From Mr Bower tacksman
No
Yes but many of the people have not that privilege
It is a mile from the man who is farthest away from it
Yes
Yes there is a horse allowed to every full croft
Those who have land suitable for ploughing use the horses and there are others who have not been able to use a horse at all in cultivating their land
Some years seldom
Yes a few families who have nets
There are many of them who have no nets
Yes
Yes every one of them
Yea
I have not seen such destitution for the past forty years such want of food
Yes
Yes many of us got that
There were not many who went to ask relief and who needed it but got it but there are many who are still needy and who have not got it but these did not I think ask for it
Yes those who have nets go but there are not many in our townships who have nets
They are not able to buy them
Yes
Yes
The south country people are spoiling itfishing it in daylight and trawling and so spoiling it on the poor peopletrawling even on the Sabbath day
I have not noticed anything of that
The steamers are very careful
No I did not hear but another might have heard of it
From s d to s
Yes according to the means of getting it to market
Yes if the poor people had an opportunity of salting them they would get a better price for them and steamers would have less to take with them in great hauls and the poor people would then get a better price
If they had money wherewith to buy barrels and salt they themselves could sell the herring when they had cured them
No we have no means of doing it
Yes and if the steamers would not take them perhaps a poor man would lose twelve crans and more and then their nets along with them
Yes people would be the better of the telegraph
We could know all about the state of the market and when the fishing was in he loch
Yes
Yes and thankful to do that
If I would know how much land I was to getwhat summing I could keep on it
We do not know what his rent is
No as we dont know what the tacksman is paying
We would pay a fair rent if we would get the land
If he lifts his potatoes early he may be able to plant cabbage
Yes that is my experience also
If it could be left out of cultivation two years we could get a double crop out of it
No
Going away to their earnings and getting help at home here and there getting a few bits of land from such of the crofters as can afford to give them it
No
No not to speak of as the crofters have no work to be done for them
Four or five cows forty or fifty sheep and a horse or two
Ten or eleven acres
I would say 
No as I do not know what the rent is
I do not know but it might be worth more according to the demand and the quality of the land
Yes according to what valuation could be made for it
I dont believe there are more than two for each lot
Yes plenty
They are spending in meal in the halfyear as much as would pay for such a croft
I am fortyseven years paying rent
I cannot remember exactly but I will guess about sixteen or seventeen
Yes
Yes they were taken from Keppoch
Those of the Keppoch people who would not go to Australia were settled down among us
He had fifty sheep at least
That was before they lost the hill
He was paying  s
Yes
Yes they had plenty of food then
They were making food from what they grew themselvesmaking meal of their own oats and using their potatoes
Yes I was working in the south in the year of the potato failure
Yes
I dont remember the people being as poor as they are this year the most of them
Those who could not take such large crofts as that could take smaller
No
Yes
The land that my grandfather had is in green rigs marching with us on the other side of our fence
There is no other remedy that they talk of
Yes we think so and then we will not require any outside assistance
If we could only get land we could work
Yes
About twentyfive years
I have a verbal statement to make
We had hill pasture and it was taken from us about thirtyeight years ago
Then part of our arrears were taken off our account and three years afterwards were added to our account
We have fortyfive families in Elgoll in a township about a mile square and besides these there are seventeen cottar families in our midst
There are fortyfive paying rent
We are only in a poor condition for want of a place that will support us and we are much in need of land if we could get it and between the crofters and the cottars on our place we would occupy very much more land than we have if we could get it
There are eight townships about us which had been cleared and we were placed on that point
There is beside us a township Keppoch from which fortyfour families were removed and sixteen of them were sent away to Australia
Five of these families were placed among us in ElgolL This was in  From some of the crofters of Elgoll land was taken to accommodate those families who were placed among us and these are cottars today their forefathers having been crofters paying rent
We are three miles from the highway and we can only bring supplies for our families either on our backs by land or by boat when we have the opportunity
We bring our supplies from Broadford which is sixteen miles away from ussee Appendix A
XIII
There are about eleven miles only of roadway from Broadford towards us
Three miles of the distance between us and the roadway is through rocky land without even a footway
Our shore is exposed it is very roughthe only place where we can haul up our boats
The schoolhouse was erected on the place where we would be hauling up our boats and drying our nets and there is now no place where we can perform either of these operations
We are in a very stormy place our houses being now and again unroofed with the wind
We cannot get thatch
No thatch grows on our own place
We only get thatch by stealing it from the neighbouring tacksmanMr Bower
We are confined on a square mile of landclose upon  soulsand the tacksman with whom we are marching has six miles of extent of country for himself
The whole estate is in the hands of two tacksmen except the square mile which we have
StrathAird belonging to Mr Alexander Macallister
The only thing we require is extended holdings out of which we can make our living
We cannot make a living off the land at all
It has become exhausted
It has been constantly cultivated since the time of our forefathers close upon the last  years
I myself sowed three bolls of oats and the return which I got would not exceed one boll
I have not seen a pound of meal of my own manufacture during the last twentyfive years during which I was in possession of my holding and for the sort of stock which I have I have to bring feeding from Glasgow and Greenock
Besides that my own family are out  in food
If I could now get the land it would be better for me to have to pay  of rent for what I could make a living out of
 s
Two cows and a twoyear old is the summing but the land would not support these at all
About three acres but we dont turn that
We dont cultivate all that
It has become exhausted
About two acres and some of that is not more than an inch of soil overlying rocks and during rains the sea for a quarter of a mile from our shore is turned red with the soil washed off our land
A corner of the hill which is very rocky
We have not enough ground either to summer or winter them
Yes I think so for all the good we are taking out of the ground
I cannot say much because we are not taking our living out of it
We depend upon fishing and work
Yes and some of them are worse off
In some instances there are three in one lot
They are as poor as people can be
About thirty years since the potatoes faded first
When the land is going back we are going back also
They are very much worse off today
Yes
The want of land and there is plenty of land beside us if we could only get it
The ground is getting weak
We are turning it every year
Some turn it twice a yearmuch of it and there is no land but what is lying on the top of rocks
I dont think it possible
Even if it were good land there is not enough of it
That the land is not yielding its crop it is being turned so often the bits that we have
We cannot leave out a bit of it
Yes I could not take a living out of American land of the same size
That the land was yielding more crop
I was not under the necessity of buying so much food either for myself or my family
Fishing
We get no work from our landlord
We have to work in other countries the east coast and Ireland
It is from there we make our living
The rest of the estate is better than that if we could get it
If we could only be allowed to encroach upon the tacks for three miles we would take a living out of it where our forefathers were
Yes if we could get the land along with it
Yes to be near a roadway for the place is so difficult of access
No there was not much
A neighbour of mine informed me that s was taken off each croft and that that was laid upon him again at the end of two years
I dont think that every crofter was in arrears
It was a reduction of rent
No
No not one shilling
I believe that all of us are in the same condition
I am sure they are we paid for our meal last winter and we now get on credit what we require up to the next time of payment
Some are not clear
Some of them are and some are not
The neighbour who is in good credit assists the one who has not
About six or seven families in our township
Yes I remember that
Yes
Yes very uncommon
Yes I know that it is
Mr Alexander Macallister
No
Not in my recollection
Yes
About forty years ago
Kirkibost and Kilmorie
They form one tack under Mr Bower and Camusunary is the other tack in the possession of Mr Laidlaw
Yes
It will be about six miles in length
About a square mile
Some of them are the descendants of those who were paying rent
Yes
About seven families
Yes
Yes
Was not that land which our forefathers had cultivating it
Yes fine good land which our forefathers had
It was once beautiful and green but it is now getting under moss
Yes  I am a Skyeman to my backbone
Yes
The rent was not taken out of the croft
It was earned at fishing
The school board
Yes plenty of it
Witness
Yes
It is not a very suitable place for a quay or place of that sort but it could be made very much better than it is
Yes
We are paying road money to the county of Inverness and we have not a road at all ourselves
It is getting worse the longer it is left out of cultivation and it would be improved if it were brought under cultivation for pasture
Yes
No the ground was so hard
It is dry enough but we would be afraid to improve in case we would be turned out by the landlord or factor
No not on our land
Yes
Only one at present
NAME
One of them is here present
They dont get work at all
They live by fishing and by cultivating bits of ground they get from the crofters
They are a burden upon the crofters
I have been twenty years in the township and ten years on my present croft
Yes
I  cannot be sure how many were present on the night on which we were  gathered
That was Saturday last in the schoolhouse at Kihnuir
There was a good number of them
Yes and the minister was present
There were up to twenty
That we are gathered together on the worst spot of Mr Scobies tack  near the shore and that we are surrounded by a dyke which dyke is  surmounted by wire fencing to keep us into the shore
We ourselves were  made to pay half of the expense of that dyke to keep us in that pinfold
I myself in one year paid to account of expense of that dyke s d  to the best of my recollection
No we are not paying it every year
The delegate who preceded me was  making complaint that we were without roadway
Our road lies through a  peat moss and in winter we cannot use it for taking home our peats
Where there are two women taking home a creel of peats each the one  woman often has to drag the other out of the mud the road is so bad
Now as a remedy for the hardships of the people I think they should  get the ground and the hill pasture along with the arablefrom  ten to twelve acres of arable ground along with as much hill pasture as  would graze from forty to sixty sheep with four cows and their  followers and a horse to work the ground
They cannot make use of the  ground without a horse even should they get that ground and even  should they have such land given them it would be without profit to  them unless they would get assurance from Government that no landlord  would have the power to evict them after they had cleared that ground  and improved it for themselves
Yes  the tacksmen have the ground
Yes indeed we would
No not in the island
I am not aware that he was ever residing there
A man of the name of John Clark
As manager he is overlooking everything
I cannot enter upon that for there are only twenty years since I came to Feorlick and Scobie was there before me
Yes
Yes
Yes they are included in one tack
I believe they could not very well do so on their getting it but I do not doubt they would be able to stock it through time
Yes  they could do it
They are paying rent already every year
I am only  paying  s and a few pence
I am at the least spending  in  purchasing meal
Would not that pay a good bit of land for me
I think it is twentynine lots
I cannot tell the number of inhabitants
There are thirty families in Harlosh
No  we do not get it free
We have free as much seaware as our foreshore  yields but we pay Scobie for what we get from the rest of the shore
Forty  years in the one house and my father was an old soldier
He was at the  battle of Waterloo
He was ninetyeight and he was in the house before  me  I succeeded him
No
Yes
The  first factor we had in Harlosh was Mr Gibbons
He was an Englishman  and he was not a good one
That was MLeods property
When he came to  Harlosh the people were working at kelp and kelp was at a good price at  that time
The land was dear when there was such a good price for the  kelp and when the kelp work ceased the people fell into arrears and  could not pay the rent
MLeod then got Harlosh valued by a gentleman at  what it was worth and it was valued by Captain MLeod of Orbosts  father and Mr MLeod of Gesto
They valued Harlosh at  and the  townships of Crochinish and Balmore were included in that
When Mr Gibbons came he saw it was a bargain and he coveted it in his heart
I believe in  to the best of my recollection
Mr  Gibbons arrived at the time this valuation was made
He went to MLeod  and asked him for the township of Feorlick and the factor gave him a  tack of it and the people along with it
He got the people from MLeod  with the tack and he himself was to have paid the rent
When he  Gibbons got Harlosh to himself he saw that it was a good bargain and  that there was room in it and he removed the people that were in the  middle of Feorlick and placed them in Harlosh
I have the names of those  who have been so removed and they are in MLeods books
Four in Breckinish six in Crochinish and eight were also removed from Talisker farm
Seventeen
He placed these families as close together as the sea would allow him  and we have but very little land and it will not support us  and some  of those he took from Minginish were placed upon peat soil which had  never previously been cultivated
When he packed the people in that way  Ebost tack was then free and he thought that was a better bargain and  gave up Feorlick
Then Major MKinnon succeeded him
He was not very  severe on the people
They were paying rent in work but he removed some  of the people Malcolm Stewart and Murdo Macdonald  these had  not a place on earth on which they could put a foot
I myself saw them  living under a sail spread on three poles under highwater mark
He  warned off Donald Campbell for giving shelter to a poor man who had not a  place to live in
I saw the officer coming to his house and breaking  into it and he went in with a pad of water and extinguished the fire  and a great steam arose in the house and what with the noise of the  fire extinguishing and the denseness of the steam his wife went out of  her senses
We were then advised that if we would tow her after a boat  in the sea she would get better and we took her out and she would not  sink deeper than up to her breast
I myself was two years in an asylum  in Glasgow
I was a keeper there and I never saw one that was so mad as  her
Now Major MKinnon went to Edinburgh and it was said he was  brained there
He was succeeded by Mr John Scobie who came to Harlosh  where I live
He told us freely that MLeod of Dunvegan had  overgiven  to him that he might do what he liked with us and he said it was God  who sent him there
He came and took a view of Harlosh as the spies did  who went to spy out the land of Canaan
There is a place there called  Ardmore Pointa peninsula in Harlosh He thought that would make a  splendid park for tups and he thought that whatever became of the  people he would have such a park there and he removed four of them  and said he would make them as comfortable up at Balmore as they  were before
He said that he had told MLeod about it and that he had  promised MLeod he would make them as comfortable as they were before
The four people went up to see where they were to be located
There was a  piece of mossy ground there which had never been cultivated and was  in its primeval state and when the people saw the place they would not  go into it
John Campbell was one of them John Macdonald was another  and they said they would trust to the providence of God and if God  should support them they would go to Australia
If I do that I cannot tell the truth
The Commissioners must need hear my story for I have a great deal to say or another day must be taken to it
They said they would go to Australia and they preferred to do so and  they asked Mr Scobie if he would take over their crop and their houses
He would not buy the houses but the manager and himself said they would  buy the crop
His manager and himself laid their heads together and  the manager said  the corn is braird and we cannot value it
The  mans crop was worth a great deal but he only got a trifle for it
Two  of them went to Australia and they died on the passage and were thrown  overboard
The third man who remained chose as he had no other place  to go to this piece of peat ground  and when he went to it there was  no place in which he could build a house and it is on my lot that his  house is built
What land he got was too small
Scobie then on a  certain morning came over to my lot on the sly and viewed it
My lot  was marching with a bit of peat moss which the other man had and he  took an acre of my ground and added it to the other mans ground and he  valued what he took from me at s and he threw me in upon other  people who were living upon three acres of ground or grass and I have  only now the sixth part of two acres to keep my cow alive
After that Mr  Scobie removed Donald Campbell and also Ronald MCaskill
These left  the country
One of them went to North Berwick and the other to  Inverness
When Campbell was put out of the house not a tenant in  Harlosh was allowed to give him shelter
His wife had nine children and  they were naked
They were on the hill sides during a wet night and to  all appearance she was a good woman and she was heard praying on the  hillside for help to God
I have another cause of complaint
Scobie again took our hill pasture which we had had for fifty or sixty  years before and he settled crofters upon it
Neither the proprietor  nor himself took a lawful way of depriving us of it but there are  people still paying for that hill pasture and we are paying for it for  it was oursthat is Roshkill
I have another grievance
For the past sixty years we have been paying road money  s of road money or four days work as an equivalent
There is no road  to send our children to school and it is peat moss and in winter if  it should happen that one in our township should die there is no way  for us to dispose of his remains unless we bury them in the sea or in  the peat moss near home
There was another way which we could use but  Mr Scobie closed it up and we could not enter upon it unless we broke  the gate which he had placed upon it and locked with a padlock
We  would desire to have the land at its value and plenty of it that we  should get fixity of tenure and that we should get the land here from  Government and compensation for working it and that we should remain  to work it
I must needs stay at home
I am for the past twentyfive  years going to the south country and earning rent for which I have  nothing
In England at Barnsley Yorkshire
Working  sometimes above ground and sometimes under it
I forgot a little
We  were not allowed to get a tuft of heather to make rope for thatching our  houses
Two years
When my father died I came home to occupy his holding
I have a croft but I do not live by the croft
I am a sort of a tradesman
A tailor
Twentyseven years
It is the tailoring that is keeping me alive the sort of a living that I have
I have nothing to say about them but that they are tradesmen like myself
They number only a merchant and a shoemaker
There is another man who has got a bit of ground
I have nothing to do with Kilmuir
We have a little village to ourselves which belongs of right to Harlosh
I am able to tell about that
Yes and clothed much warmer
They are now clothed in south country rags
I have seen about thirtyfive years ago when I was a boy the webs of clothtwenty yards to twentysevenwhich had been manufactured by the women of the household
The want of wool and the want of the mother of the woolthe sheepto us poor people
Yes what else
In the beginning of my days it was very much easier for them to pay than it is now
It is very little that I am seeing nowadays of Highland cloth at all
They are doing their utmost to pay me
Very much more difficult
Many of the people would have nothing to do with the south country rags if they could do otherwise
They buy the cloth mostly for they dont consider the south country clothes so well r so strongly made as in our country
The people on my side of the country have no wool themselves
The people who have sheep stock as we have heard today may possibly get a share of the wool
Some of them send wool to the south perhaps one in a hundredto be made up into cloth
They have not it
I do not know anything beyond the MLeod country
No unless they buy as strangers would buy
 know about outsiders from hearsay
Their wool would do little for them with us
I am sure of that
Worse I have a large family
Four
William Campbell pays the highest rent I think it is about 
Another is near that and I myself pay s of bare rent and the dues come to s
One cow
And a stirk by buying some feeding
No sheep
No but the Harlosh people claim our place
They have a few
One may have one or two and others have none at aU
Yes we buy wool for clothes and stockings
Where I was born which was in Bracadale there were comfortable crofters there
They were in comfortable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 circumstances
They had cattle and sheep and horses
They had a great stretch of hill pasture
Not now because the wool is so dear
Those who are able to buy are buying now for the manufacture of bed clothing
The way the prices of sheep go it would come very dear to them
My own experience
No
A man has enough to do to attend to his family
Yes
Forty years and more ago
No not much since then but I could get at that time a good fleece of which I could make two or three pairs of stockings for s
I used at first to go from house to house but I ceased doing it
I ceased that about seventeen years ago
I have since then gone very little among the houses
In my young days the children would have beautiful shirts on them of white blanketing and a little kilt and a jacket and went barefooted
At that time the young girls were clothed equally well with the boys but now they wear cotton rags
Some of them are good enough
The clothes I have on mo now came from the south of England
I wish to explain that it was the pollingbooth I meant that the candidates went into
For room
Yes
Yes
No
I  was nineteen years paying rent in Ramasaig
My brother and I were on the one lot
My brother became sickly and fell into arrears
Then he died and another brother of mine entered the place from Edinbane
He remained four or five years in it and the arrears were increasing on him and when he saw this he left entirely and returned to Edinbane and the arrears were then left about my head
They then began to warn me out of the place for these arrears and then I began to ask for another place owing to the way in which I was disgusted with the warnings I was getting
Tormore was the factor then and he sent me word I would get a lot in Skiniden if I would give him the stock and  sheep which I had in Skiniden
He himself had made a club stock of the stock of Skiniden
I told him I would give him the sheep as I was sinking in arrears paying for warning every year
I then came to Skiniden and when I did so here were five on the lot on which I entered
Four others and myself had the lot on which I entered
The factor made me pay the arrears which had accumulated on my brothersee Appendix A
XXIV
Yes and we had a house each and we were getting separate receipts for our rents and I gave up to the factor my receipts and he kept them several years in his possession at Tormore
I was thinking I would not get them back at all but I sent for them to him and when the receipts came back the factor told me he could not deny but I had paid him my own share of the rentthat he could not help it but his predecessor in the factorship was responsible for itthat it was so in the books
Yes
No man could have land without having his name in the books
No I had nothing to do with my brothers possession nor he with mine
There were separate receipts and separate payments
The arrears which had accumulated on my two brothers were exacted from me
They kept my share of sheep value  for these shares
Yes I never got the value of a snuff
Yes it was divided between my brother and myself the lot
It was myself and other people of the township who were seeing to its being divided properly
We were getting separate receipts after this division
Yes the factor never objected to it
Yes he must have known for after my brother left I asked him for the whole croft
It would not be exacted from me as long as I would remain in Ramasaig but when I left they kept the sheep from me and he told me that if I would give him the sheep and  in money I would get a lot in Skiniden
I had not the money and he said he would take the sheep for the  and I got such security
He did not make a price for the sheep but as he chose himself but those who came after me got   being  per head over all
On the lot on which I now am there are arrears on the person who occupies it with me and they can lay his arrears upon me as they did before
I cannot contend with them at law
If I could I would have taken it off them having my receipts there to produce
I gave up all expectation
Sometimes that is done but rarely
MLeod of MLeod
Alexander MDonald Portree
Yes
Peter MLean
No
I did not pay anything to the landlord so far as I know
To Mr MLean
Yes because he paid the same sum before me
It was after I took it that I understood the matter but so far as I understand from what I heard the money did not go to the proprietor
I think the original beginning of it was about a house that was on the farm
It was the value of the old house
Yes
Most likely
Well it depends on circumstances
I cannot guarantee that but to show the scarcity of land I was almost forced to do it
It was no necessity but my own free will
I understood he got a better place
Yes and I counted it as an obligement that I got it
So far as I understood the rules he could not give it to me without the consent of the factor
Yes
I cannot say because MLean had to do with the factor and I had to do with MLean
I think he knows it
No because I never had the opportunity
We live a distance apart from one another
Not yet
No the house has fallen I cannot tell how long since
No
I dont think it so far as I know I understand it was not as arrears but for the price of the house and MLean had to pay the same as I had
NAME
MLean had it only a year
I do not think he was in arrears
Yes
I was away for some time but I was back every year
I was away ten years
I was at Glasgow
Yes working
Yes
Yes
Partly
Yes
It is as follows  I am thirtysix years of age and was born in Kilmuir parish of Duirinish
My father was born at Ramasaig and is about seventyfive years of age
He was evicted from there to Idrigill from Idrigill to Forse and from Forse back to Idrigill where he was only one year
Then he was removed or evicted to Kilmuir where he was only for a few years when he was removed to his present croft which he has occupied for about fortyeight years
He was removed from the first four places for no other reason than to make room for sheep
He was not in arrears of rent
He has seen all the following townships laid waste or depopulated
No
Not  all but to some of them
Not all
It does every word
I have been speaking to them
I was appointed to come here today and state my views and that is my statement
Yes 
Yes
They are very seldom in arrears but if they are they pay them
I have
I cannot say
 and I heard of a tenant paying 
A small one
I believe four years rent
Yes there are four here
Quite unconnected
It did not matter who it was
It is paid at once before they enter possession
Quite common
It is quite easy to get them
Yes
They never look to the rent if they get a croft in some cases a good many of them
If I were leaving my croft today I could get forty that would take it
I believe they would if it were asked for
At a great increase
No
On my house rent
No feu or leasejust the house I have on my fathers croft
Not a day
I can be removed at any time
I just built the house to save thatch
I put slates on it and I was taxed
It is the inspector of poor who collects it
The police tax goes to Inverness
My father is entered as proprietor and I am his tenant
At any moment
Without compensation
The he use was only built on the croft
No but Malcolm my house is superior to others
There are seven or eight in the district who have done so and are taxed the same as my house
I can be turned out tomorrow
No I cannot say
I just built it on chance because I thought it would be cheaper in the end to slate than to thatch itthan to be thatching it every year
It is entered in the valuation roll at 
It is the proprietor I believe
Not unless we would catch trout
They would have no objection unless there were some nasty contentious people that would not like to see their neighbours getting on and catching fish
I never heard of it The fishermen themselves would not object to it
No where we trawl we do not interfere with the herring nets
We never fish with hand lines where we trawl nor long lines either
Mr Mackenzie of the post office
I only know one of themAlexander Mlnnes
I mention them all in my paper
I believe they would
Certainly
No
I have stated in my paper the reasons
I know it from the board when there are two meetings parochial board and school boardthere is s paid for the room and when there is one meeting there is s d paid
NAME
Certainly it comes out the expenditure of the board
Certainly they get food at the inn by the payment of the s
Well I cannot say about any other places
I only know MInnes

Mr Robertson and Dr Martin
Mr MacDonald Portree
John Shaw Waternish
It was depopulated and again depopulated a second time
They might be the same people in some cases but probably not
About sixty years ago and the second five or six years ago Lowergill and Ramasaig
I cannot say
From different townships
Not all at once
I know it was done twice
No I cannot
No
It is done it is given to strangers
No I do not mean that
I mean that when my neighbour leaves I do not get his croft supposing I asked for it it is a stranger that gets it
No
I dont want overcrowding  I want to get it myself
To the next neighbour
I wrote it myself in my own handwriting but I got the headings and put it down in pencil in my passbook
Most of the people in the place
Not that paper but they saw my heads and knew what I was to write
It was this morning I wrote the paper
Yes
Certainly
Yes
Yes
There are thirtythree whole lots and  half lots that is fortytwo
I never consulted the fortytwo
About the half of them
No I never called on them
In some cases it is objected tonot in all cases
Yes
Not here
It must have been long ago
I never heard him object to any coming in
I think it was his duty to tell them it was wrong
It may be lawful but I know it is wrong
No he cannot while the voting is going on
But the electors objected to it
I am aware of that but it is wrong and it should be done away with here at elections
I dont blame the returning officer
No I do not attribute blame to him
I blame the candidates
Certainly because they were standing and looking over the voting and they walked in with the electors to the place where the clerk was sitting and saw how they voted
Certainly there were hundreds who saw it
Yes
I did
No I put them out of the room  and there was one man present in the room who would not give his vote till they were turned out of the room clerk and all
I was in the room at the time and I was turned out and two or three of the candidates as well
None but himself when he voted
I should think so
Oh yes
About thirty years
Yes
Yes
Yes in the main
I am ready to answer any questions
Last year it was very bad
The year before that was little better
No there only four boats in the place that I call boats but there are some old ones that are not fit for sea and the new ones are too wee to go to the open sea with and there are no fish coming into the lochs just now and we cannot go to the open sea for want of boats
In the Minch
Yes if we had the boats and material to go
I am certain they would go to some other district and fish there to the east coast and Lewis and Harris
They are able enough to go if they had boats and materials to go
They are as good after they are taught and learned by them
Not that I know of
The only bait is herring and sometimes it is very scarce for long lines
Yes about the oysters
I do not know
I heard people say that but I was lifting them and was never prohibited from lifting them
Yes
Twentynine years
Yes
I would like before I say anything further that I would have the assurance that no vengeance will be taken on me for anything I say here today for one of the delegates who are here today was told by Mr Robertson the factor that he must take care what he was to say here today
Mr Robertson Grishornish
He is not present
I do not think there is any one here to represent the estate
I will tell the truth for the truth will assert itself at any rate
Statements prepared by the Tenants of Edinbane
Our lots are from  to  acres of arable land
There are about  half lots from subdivision
A large piece of the hill has been taken from us called Ben Dhu and no compensation given
Several of our lots have been taken down by  acre and no reduction of rents
The proprietor has never done anything for the land
The houses are built and maintained by ourselves
On removal we get compensation for the roof only
We think our rents too high when so much land has been taken from us and the rent in many cases raised
They were last raised to give the factor Mr Robertson votes
We are not in arrears
Seven days work is claimed by Mr Robertson from each lot and s is taken from us for every day we miss
He likes us to give him the first offer of stock but he does not fix the prices
A lot is allowed four cows and twentyfour sheep
Four cows are too many for the pasture
The profits from sheep go direct to Mr Robertson for rent
We never touch a penny of the money
The money from our sheep for the rent instead of being put in the bank for us until Martinmas when it is due is kept by Mr Robertson for his own use and we get no interest from him for it
We cannot utilise fishing for the want of proper boats c
Fishing should be distinct from crofting
There were plenty of evictions in Grishornish and Coshletter before the time of the late Mr MLeod
Many of us have seen the law officers come and strip the roofs in Edinbane and pour water down on the fires
The people evicted mostly emigrated
They got no compensation
The land is now largely in the hands of Mr Robertson the factor
We would migrate not emigrate
No Gaelic is taught at our schooL We would like our children taught to read the Gaelic Bible
The school rates are a shilling
Fees for standard IIL Is d
There are eight paupers on the estate most of these on BenDhu have come from other places
Several cottars have been removed by the late Mr MLeod and by Mr Robertson from Grishornish and Coshletter and put upon us
The poorrates are d
Mr Robertson the factor has the lands once belonging to us of Kerrol and BenDhu in his own hands
We received no reduction when these lands were taken from us
Mr Robertson keeps a mealstore and we nearly all deal with him
We are this year already very deep in his books for meal
When Mr Robertson put the money on to our rents for votes for himself as he said he promised to make it good to us but he has never done so although we protest every year
We can give many other instances of oppression
One man took in a lodger against Mr Robertsons wish
He was fined a  and had to pay the  for five or six years and was only pardoned last Martinmas
Another man for selling a stack of corn off the farm although he had offered it to Mr Robertson several times and was in sore need of ready money was punished by having his rent raised from  s d to  which he still pays
The year before last two men quarreled about the march of their crofts
Mr Robertson ended the quarrel by fining the man with the largest croft s a year on to his rent and no corresponding reduction to the man with the small croft
In November last the factor put s on to a half lot with the reason stated  I want to make a gentleman of you and give you a vote
Mr Robertson has two shares of sheep in the hill and although we complained he will not pay for the grazing and he refuses to let our sheep go over the lands of Kerrol which is our right in winter and makes us twice a year build up the dyke that keeps our own sheep out of our own grazings
We have to submit to such things as these for fear of being evicted
Reforms wanted
More land and fixity of tenure
We cannot improve our lands at present as they will not support our families while we are improving them but if we had enough of land to keep us on it the whole year round and if we were made secure against fines and evictions from petty spite of the factor or other causes we would improve it and there would be no more heard of destitution in hard years like this
When the credit which this bad year drove us into is settled for there will not be much of our stock left to us we think
Our delegates will be able to give evidence to all the above
The delegates appointed are MURDO M LEAN NEIL GILLES KENNETH M FIE EWEN M LEA N
Twentyfive whole crofts
Ten
Yes
Only for Edinbane
There are no tenants there the landlord has it
t was at first apportioned out into twentyfive lots
That was long ago
They were divided at that time as they are now
Yes I cannot tell how long it is since the division was made
A long time before we came to Edinbane
Yes
Yes
There are ten I think
No
They were brought in
Most of them were brought in
Most of them from Coshletter and Grishornish
Six were brought in from outside Edinbane
They came from Grishornish and Coshletter one being from Grishornish
Yes
There are four of these six paupers
It was in the late proprietors time he brought in four of them and Mr Robertson two
It is more than twenty years since Mr MLeod brought in the four
It is the land of the crofters which they have but it is to Mr Robertson that they pay for all that
They are paying s a year
The crofters will be helping them more than the cottars are a help to them
No
We are complaining of the arable land
One crofter would need to have as much as any three of us have
Is there not plenty of land waste in the Isle of Skye
Is not the property of MLeod waste altogether
There are no more than three crofter townships on the MLeod estate and the rest all waste landsheep and deer
Yes
Yes
Yes
It is from Coshletter we were brought and there are many others in our township who were brought from Coshletter also because of the sheep
This was when Mr Cameron bought the estate and made Coshletter into a sheep tack and removed us from it
Twentynine years ago
Some of them went away to America and others to Australia
You have heard how the law officers were extinguishing their fires and knocking down their houses
Yes when they were removed from Coshletter themselves
None of late
Some of them got removings but were not evicted
One got a removing this year but was not evicted
I do remember an instance of such compensation
When we ourselves came to Edinbane we had to pay for the roofs of the houses which we got
I got a little but others did not for the shepherd went to live in the house in which I had been
Yes that is so
Only those whose houses were made use of got compensation
I myself took the roof of my byre and stable with me to Edinbane for I would not get anything for it
No
Reaping or cutting hay or grass
No it was upon the home farm
Some have horses
Some of them up to  But we have to pay s additional for the wintering of the horse and we have to take grazing for the horse elsewhere during the summer and autumn
No
Yes the land is getting poorer and the crop scantier each year
Incessant cultivation for the past seventy years and more
We tried that the land is very much exhausted
I tried grass in a part of it during the past three years and I had to give it up
You know the holding is so small and as part of it cannot be left out of cultivation to enable it to recover that is rendering it worthless
Yes
No  not in grass
Those of course who had only half lots could not leave any part of it out
No but his store is the most convenient
Mr Robertson will not be pleased if we go elsewhere to buy
Last year s a boll
I do not know what the price is this year
No
No
He offers a price for them and of course if the party gets a higher offer Mr Robertson does not insist on the beast being sold to him
It is the case with the cattle very much as has been stated about the fodder and about the meal
Yes sometimes some of them
Yes
Yes
Yes
No
At the time of payment
At Sligachan about September or Martinmas
No that is the time of payment independently of the times when they realise their stock
For some time now no other mealdealers come our way
There used to be vessels with meal  coming our way but not since Mr Robertson has been keeping the store himself
Yes
NAME
Those who buy in Portree would have to pay carriage for the meal from Portreethose who would not themselves be able to carry it The meal in Portree was about  or s a boll last year
Yes
The difference is more than the carriage would be accounting for
That is the dearest it will be
Some of it is less than that
The delegate is present from whom the fine was exacted and he will speak
His name is Kenneth MFie
I cannot say how long it is since the sheep stock was made a joint stock
Yes
It was in the former proprietors time when Mr Macdonald of Orde had the management
Yes
Those who had none or those who had less than their share did their best to buy from outsiders who had more than their summing of sheep
They got the money themselves
Those who had not sheep at all Mr Robertson supplied for which they paid him money
My share was less than eighteen sheep and I paid  for them to Mr Robertson
My family had two lots and we had only six sheep on one of them
We had a whole share on the other one
No it is not pledged to the landlord or to any other
Yes
Two
We are at liberty to sell anything to the value of  but beyond  we are not at liberty to sell without the consent of Mr Robertson
Yes
There are twentynine shares
Yes there are twentyeight shares and the shepherd has one share as his wages
Yes
Yes and the hotelkeeper has half a share and another man who lives in Kerrol has another half share making twentynine shares altogether
Yes
We sell lambs
Between  and  tups
We ourselves try to sell them and Mr Robertson does the same
If we get the money we hand it to Mr Robertson and if Mr Robertson gets it he keeps it
No
The purchaser pays on delivery
About Lammas is the usual time or past Lammas
Yes
Yes that is what we complain ofsee Appendix A
XVII
Yes
It will not pay the rent and expenses altogether but it is helping us to pay the rent very much
Yes  two crofts
I am paying 
 s and some pence
Yes
Yes
Yes
It is the woolbrokers in Glasgow who are buying the wool
They advance the money if it is not sold at Martinmas
Yes
Yes except last year
Yes
I know it was taken off them
No
Yes no reduction
It was added to the innkeepers farm
I cannot Bay
I do not know but I think it was taken from three crofts
They were all beside one another
Yes
Yes it was just below the main road
They got the first year from a farm in Kerrol for it more than what was taken from them
It is just beside us part of our town
Only one or two years till Mr Robertson came in and he took that land away from them and gave them no reduction
Well they cannot be so well without this taken off them and nothing got for it when the rent is the same
These three crofts were equal with the other holdings
Yes
If a man had as much land as would support his family all the year round if he himself will not be about the croft working it he cannot improve it and bring it to its utmost cultivation
If a man had as much land as would support his family the working of the land would keep him going without having to go to fish
Yes unless they would go to fish a little for their families
Yes but to get as much land as would enable him to support his family comfortably through the year and if we would get that I do not believe we would be troubling landlords or other people for help
I do not think that
I think every fisherman ought to have a little land along with his house
I think the fisherman would not be able to manage so much as the crofter as he would not be able to devote his time to fishing
Yes
The fishermen with us have not very large boats and they are only fishing as much as will keep their families going and therefore I think so far as we are concerned we should have the land as much as would keep our families in comfort
And is it not that which has spoiled them and made them poor people  They were taken from other parts and packed by the seashore and the best part of the land under sheep
I do not mean that such a fisherman ought to be among us at all
I do not mean that among us there should be people placed on small crofts in order that they might devote themselves to fishing
I myself have got two nets at home and last year I did not fish more than a barrel of herring with them and in that way how could I depend upon fishing
I am only losing my time with it
I know that a fisherman without land would not do in our place
He was a hawkera rag collector
Minginish entirely the parish of Bracadale altogether except a little that was given to the cottars in Struan
Yes it is there that the crofters would get justice
The best land in Skye is there
Was it not crofters that were on them before
It is there that crofters would thrivegood strong land if it were taken under cultivation now
They would stock it with sheep and cattle
If they got good land it would be easier for them to get money
If they were located on the land in such a way as that neither landlord nor anybody else would interfere with them they might get assistance from Government to buy the land
No
The Cuchullins
In the Cuchullins and Minginish
Not in the upper parts of the mountains
Yes it was made up in Edinbane
Yes but MLeod of MLeod has much better land if we could only get it
School board votes
I dont know but the schoolmaster is a south country man who has no Gaelic
I dont know
Yes
He does not speak it at any rate
No
To make profit to himself no doubt
We were at the beginning of this spring very much in straits for meal and we thought that he should have had a constant supply of meal in his store and were it not for the supply of meal that Dr Fraser got there would some of us have perished
There was no meal at that time
He tells us the price at the time
Yes
Not yet
I cannot exactly say
It is more than that
Yes
We were putting up with him as he was
Yes
A few years
Mrs Murray the widow of Mr Murray of Grishornish and it was left with her in liferent
I remember when MLeod of MLeod bought Grishornish
MLeod sold it shortly before he became bankrupt
No that was before my time
When Sheriff Macdonald was I think in Grishornish it was he who was selling the land in Grishornish and other portions of the estate
His reason was that he was expecting to get some votes himself in consequence
I cannot be sure but that is what I think
Yes there was a contest
I cannot say that Mr Robertson did ask us out and out
Yes
Yes
LieutenantColonel
I am not aware that crofters have been removed from townships for the  purpose of bettering the condition of those who are left behind or that crofters have been removed from holdings for the purpose of having better holdings given to them
I was a fisherman at one time
The former witness and myself were put forward to speak for the rest
Yes
There is plenty to say in addition if it would be of any use
We are not wanting much wealth if we only could get a place where we could grow crops
But we are placed on land where we cannot grow cropsoft peaty land
It is two years since we sent anything to the mill to grind
Before then we may have been sending a little while there was strength in the ground
We think that if we could get a place in which we could grow a crop we would be quite willing to pay a reasonable rent for itif we could get aplace where we could work for ourselves and improve ourselves
Yes there is land
Our sheep are trespassing upon it and being poinded and we ourselves are quite willing to take it and to pay for it
I mean land which is near us which we never had before which would grow crop and which would answer our purpose
I do not say we are paying for it but that we are willing to pay for it if we got it
Yes
He said at first that we would get it and then that we would not
No it is just as it was when we got the place
Ascrib island
Yes we were we were producing food which we cannot produce where we are
They were without schooling and that is the reason why we could not write to Edinburgh to the Commissioners as others have done
No
Up to fifteen
We spoke about that but we were not thought of sufficient importance
The late Rev
Roderick MLeod of Snizort
He told us he would try to get us a lad to teach our children
No
I was very sorry when I was put out of the island though it had its drawbacks
Yes
Today
We were long of hearing
We came over here and we could not get any person to write for us
We could not write ourselves
No
That we are in a bad place
Our arable land is peat to the depth of about  or  feet and it is not yielding crop
We took it in ourselves
We were getting Is a rood from the laird for taking it in
We cannot get seaweed to manure our land unless with fine weather and a south wind
Each of us could sow three or four bags of seed oats
There are some of us who bought two bolls of seed oats to sow and some of us who even with the two bolls of seed oats which they bought along with the seed which the land yielded had not sufficient to sow their land
All the potatoes which we can cultivate will not support us more than two or three months at any rate this year
Our stock is some two cows and others three cows each and maybe a stirk or a twoyearold
I cannot tell how many sheep we have
The sheep dont belong to ourselves they belong to the landlord
We keep a horse each and the land is so soft and boggy that I can only get three hours work out of the horse and others cannot work with the horses at all
 and a few shillings each  have to pay wintering for the cows
It would be enough for me to winter one of the cows and a horse with my crop
No
Since I went to Forsavriev nineteen years ago it has not been raised
It was not for the habitation of man that that place was created at all
During the past twenty days or month we took out of the bogs on our land up to twenty ewes and some hoggs which were drowned in the bogssee Appendix A
VII
It was of our own sheep stock but the sheep stock we did not consider to belong to ourselves at all
The day we leave we cannot take any of them with us
The sheep belong to the landlord
When the people got the township the landlord sold them the sheep stock which they were to pay for and since then they have not been able to pay for the stock
I do not know but they may havepaida little at first
Yes they payinterest
 ewes
I was not among the first tenants at all
 and s each
Some of the crofters tell me so
Twentytwo years ago
There were no tenants in it until we settled in it twentytwo years ago
There was a little when we went there first but we were shifted down to the lower place since
Yes
They got Is a rood for trenching and improving this
No
Yes
No
Yes
Yes
Yes
I cannot say
Between fourteen and fifteen
Yes I would make three roods a day
Yes there are rocks and our sheep are going over these rocks to the seashore and are carried away by the sea the sea being directly under these rocks
Others of our sheep stick in the cliffs and we have to lower a man down with ropes to get them extricated
We were within the last year asking another place of him and he was promising it
The land which is wasted both in Minginish and Bracadale where my forefathers were born should be restored to the people
There is plenty of land for all the inhabitants of Skye if they could get it
No but my father came from Bracadale to Minginish
From Ascrib island some of them
Five
Yes
Yes it is ourselves who get the produce of the sheep but the day we leave we have no sheep and if we would be another year in the place we would not have a cow or sheep or other creature that we could take with us over the dyke if next year will be as the present year
The parties who are the means of this Royal Commission are suffering in prison and we are quiet here and if we dont get justice we will go to prison ourselves or else we will sell our lives as dear as possible
I was once a fisherman
The former witness was a neighbour of mine
Yes
Yes
Only that we are much in need of enlargement which we have not got in the place in which we are
We have poor land and it does not yield crop and we are spoiled with having to buy everything
I have had to buy nine and a half bolls of meal already and one and a half bolls of seed already since the new year
They are not all at home
I have ten of a family  four are away
Eight
Some of them
If their earnings would succeed they would help me
We are very poor in our township
We can do nothing unless we can get our condition improved unless we can get our rent reduced or helpmore land in which we can keep sheep
We have neither sheep nor horses
Yes if their earnings succeed
It is the children who are helping greatly the most part of the crofters
The  land is not yielding much to help them
Yes
Glasgow and Greenock and the young men go to the east coast fishing and Ireland
I have a son in Ireland just now at the fishing
Yes
In Scor
Yes
Having to buy so largely
Purchasing has ruined me
No
It is very little I was buying in Scor and the family was not so heavy either
The oldest four years ago another three years ago and another two years ago
Since I was born
Yes
I think that those who have preceded me have left little for me to say but those who delegated me desired me to say in your presence that there are thirtythree crofts in Geary and when our fathers had it there  were twelve crofts
And they are complaining that they are without horses or sheep now
It cannot be that they could have sheep or horses when there are thirtythree tenants in Geary
Who will extend their holdings unless the landlord does it
If the landlord will not give them more room so long as there are so many sheep tacks in Skye the poor man will never get justice
Sheep do not improve the soil but the people will
The land will run into heather and rushes under sheep
Instead of that the Land should be in the hands of the people who improve it
If the people do not get enlarged holdings they will become poorer every day see Appendix A
VII I have to say further that in Geary some of the people have left for the south country leaving the spring work unfinished owing to their inability to procure food for their families as their credit was gone
In regard to debts I have to say that the landlord is very favourable to the people
He never yet put a man out of his possession for rent
Geary crofters can keep two cows aud a twoyearold but the holdings would not support these but for the landlord allowing the crofters a mouth or two grazing in spring on his own grounds
The first year that Captain Macdonald became our landlord he gave them a strip of hill pasture in addition to what they had and did not charge them one shilling extra
This year again he gave them another strip
They would have to enclose it with a dyke and they considered it too small for that
It is not the present proprietor who has done them any harm but those who preceded him
As to the hill pasture I need not say anything about it as it was taken from us at the same time that those who before were deprived of it
I am not aware of anything of the sort
I did not experience anything of the sort
I am not aware of that and I have not seen him take vengeance on any one
Yes the ground officer gives the people an offer for the stock
If the people dont accept this offer they are at liberty to sell to anybody else
If the landlord does not givo what another gives the crofters are at liberty to sell them elsewhere
It is for the stirks that he offers oftenest
Yes
That might be about the Whitsunday time
Yes I know that some are
I know that some are in arrears to the extent of a full years rent
The landlord said nothing to them about it
No not for him whatever
Surely they are
Can it bo without debt
Hundreds of bolls have been brought to it not within the last year but other years
Yes
From Greenock
There is a man named MLean a native of this island in Greenock
The Geary people are often working in Greenock
The man knows some of them
When one is not acquainted with him it is natural he will not be trusted
I am sure that that man has scores of pounds against Geary for the produce of Geary wont feed the people half a year
And I believe there is not in the island of Skye any people who have made more work in trenching their ground than the Geary people have done
Yes
I think about sixty years ago
From about Waternish
Some have come from this side of Waternish
It was done with the peoples consent
I am of opinion that if the arable land were cultivated on the  run rig system Geary would not be so well off as it is because it would not be tilled
When the west side of Waternish was cleared some of them I believe went to Geary
I believe it was the proprietor
Yes and the hill also
I will not say they did
They are as I have said
The land will no more than feed them for six months and were it otherwise there would not be so much meal coming to them from the south
Yes
The climate accounts largely for that
That is not the landlords fault
It is the work of Providence
That put a number of them back
They are very close at work earning their support
I am sure of that
No
If it is not in Waternish it is through the country
I cannot tell within a mile but I can mention the townships
Yes
I will not try that
It is big enough
If you were on board the steamer you would see its extent from sea to sea
I do not know but I think there were over eighteen families in Unish
I think Trumpan was in the occupancy of a tacksman at one time
I think there were four in Ballabourach
I dont know but there were eighteen latterly in Scorr and I think there were ten in Lower Hallistra see Appendix A
VII
I think they were
I think it was the major the present proprietors father
There were clearances by Corry but I dont think they cleared these two townships
I think for Grant
I do not remember
There are people below the road yet in Lower Hallistra
Above the road is cleared
Over 
My summing is two cows and a two yearold
No
Yes they got benefit from that
I understand that the most of my neighbours improved their holdings the same way and I am now taking out of the ground twice what I used to do
No
Yes
Yes
They are complaining of the arable land also
There is not enough of it
Just above us and I dont know but the landlord may give us that
Yes
We got a little strip this year but it is not enough
With the pick and spade
A few might get a little more work here than they got to do in their crofts
Such work as the landlord may give them
No
Yes every person that can goes to the south to work
They must do that or they would starve at home
Till Christmas plenty of those who left here a short time since
From this week
This year many came back from the east coast who did not get paid at alt
Fishing
Yes
They get other work besides fishing out of the island
It cannot be much between board and lodgingperhaps   or  It will give them enough to do by steady working to bring home  or 
They do much better at the fishing when it succeeds with them
They prefer the fishing because then chance is better
I can say that they would not put an oar between rowlocks and would not man a boat and would not hoist a sail if they were dependent upon all the fishing they got here through the year
As for the Geary people unless they catch herring no other fishing will be of any use to them for the ling fishing is very scanty
The year in which the herring take is most plentiful it will not last them much past winter
They may then take their long lines ashore
I cannot say
I think they have boats that will serve the purpose out here for on this side they catch ling
A few ling can be caught here through the year
There are no piers and no place of refuge
What would they do with the boat when they could not draw it up
I cannot say much about that
Yes they do like it and in evidence of that they are very often at Barra and the east coast
Yes they would
The fishing is very good if successful
The fishing would need to be very good before it would pay for sufficient fishing tackle and fishing material in this place
Not a pier
Yes there was  but it has long since fallen into decay
Yes
The poverty of the crofters commenced with the thirtyone families in Geary for every crofter had four or five cows and a horse and twenty sheep or so
Yes
Poverty was increasing ever since the potatoes began to fad at first
Yes
Yes
Yes
I was very young at the time
Yes
Yes
That is true near enough
That is true they had more than that
They had the islandthe island of Geary at that time
Yes
I am not sure
It is doubled today
I think they would I know they would
Fairly well
I cannot say without assistance
They would
Through the country
I think there is
Would not that be better than buying twelve bolls of meal and more from the south
I do not know if the whole would
I know that
I do not know
What could they do after they landed over I have a son in Australia and a sister and I know both sides
My son is a schoolmaster there
He does
I know that because I know the people who are alive in it now are better at working the ground than their fathers were
They were not up to it
I do not remember in my first days of any people using a pick at all
I think there are
Upwards of a year
Yes
At Knockbreac north of Hallon
No
It is below the average
Seventy is the number on the roll and the attendance is below the average of sixty which ought to be the average
Fortythree
Well there are many obstacles
I think that on account of the frequent changes of teachers the parents have been dissatisfied until I came and since I came the average attendance has been higher than ever it was before
Not one
Two miles
Not to my knowledge
Dr Martin of Husabost
Seven I think
Only one
Mr Shaw steward to Captain Macdonald
Yes
Just above
I think so
Many cases
The board has done nothing to my knowledge
It appears so
They do and the fees are very small
Is a quarter is the lowest
For everything that the youngest child can take in
Standard I Is d
 II Is d
 III Is d
 IV and above s
No the Board cannot make any arrangements for these
I do
I just make them according to the branches taught
The average fee for the higher branches is s but for extra branches and for everything s d per quarter which is not too high for the country
Six out of the number that is onetenth
No
Partly
Two or three
Latin French Euclid algebra drawing and other common subjects
Yes
They are left to the teacher because the board has no power to fix the fees above the standards
Yes but the board are responsible they are bound to pay me the entire amount of fees
There are a few
No
No I do not speak it and therefore cannot teach Gaelic
It is no barrier
More or less the whole of them understand it
It is
I have no instrument except my voice
Yes fully supplied
I have
No I dont
Native habits
Partly so
I believe it would
I think some of them expressed a wish for a Gaelic teacher here
Exactly
They dont talk Gaelic to me
No I find no difficulty
Decidedly and they stay away from school on purpose to do that
Yes for a month or six weeks
Just a little before this time six weeks before this time
Working on the ground assisting in tillage
Probably that was part of it
Yes and a few of the younger members of the family keeping the houses
Well I cannot enter into that because I was not there to see but it is possible that it would be done
Well they are very irregular
The habits of the people here are not regular at all and the attendance of the children has been very irregular in consequence I am sorry to say but I think the people are kindly disposed to the teacher and that they wish him well
If he is very strict or rigorous they think he is inimical or unfriendly to them and they requite mistaken if they do because he is only acting up to what the Government demands and what the law enacts
I can assure you that it is a very difficult thing to please the Government inspector who is very strict of course and the people on the other hand are certainly not strict and the teacher between the two fires what can he do
I have gone and visited them and remonstrated with them but still they just lapse into their old habits and they forget what is due to duty and the demands of duty
They dont seem to see a necessity of that kind but just on the spur of the moment they take the child away
No reason and No warning
They say the child has been taken away for this or that but that does not include a reason  it is simply a statement
There is no reason about it
I certainly mean that they are not so capable
Well certainly they must be
Not much difficulty
Five
Not one
Certainly
No
Certainly
Do you mean the girls
No the boys pay for the extra subjects
Certainly not
Yes
No
It is
It is
Well I think some of them are uselessly at homenot usefully employed
They are kept at home without a proper reason
They are
They are
I do not
Well they come barefooted
In winter
No because those who have boots go without them in winter
I cannot object I have no reason to meddle with these things
Well I cannot say for I do not see them eating
I have often told them if they were hungry to go into my house and only some went
Yes quite
I suppose they do because they dont go home to dinner and therefore they must have their dinner in their pockets
Oat cake and a bit of cheese when they can get it
They dont bring any flasks or bottles that I have seen
They drink water
According to the climate and according to their habits I thinknot
They can endure a great deal more than I could have endured when I was like them because I was not brought up in the same way
They are indurated to the island of Skye which I never was
Well I dont think comparatively speaking that they are poorer
I have been in Sutherlandshire and I know Sutherlandshire very well and I have found many poorer people there whose children were attending school regularly and whose fees were paid and they were not so well attended to nor so well kept up as the children here as even the very poorest of them are
Comparatively speaking the children of Skye so far as I have seen are not below the average but I would say rather above
Well I would say in point of cleanliness for the children here that come into school when you like you will find them very clean
I said rather above the average
I was comparing Highlands with Highlands
I cannot compare Highlands with Lowlands
I said they were rather above the average in contrast with Sutherland
Yes because the one is high and the other low
In Stirlingshire
I was born at Bridge of Allan
I do
Everything except in attendance at school
They are certainly not equal there
As I stated there is a lapse of attendance at this place
I cannot account for mental faculty
I do not know in regard to any other place but the calibre is certainly below that of the Lowlands
Yes
Well if you go into particulars I say the general calibre is certainly below the average but you must take everything into consideration
I am taking everything into consideration
That is a question I do not like to answer because I do not know with regard to the parents what their state is
I cannot answer that question
In August last
I have
It is as follows Summary of HM Inspectors Report October   The same old story has to be again repeated for this school
A new teacher appointed since the last inspection
The present master has been in charge since the month of April last only
The order is good but the school is as a whole in a very moderate condition
The wall plaster requires to be repaired and the room should be at once whitewashed
After the warning given last year the grant was reduced under article  B for faults of instruction
The frequent change of teachers is to be regretted
My Lords trust that the defects mentioned by HM
Inspector will be remedied without delay
It was below 
Say 
Both
That I am for the past twentytwo years paying rent on this estate and that I have not seen the mill yet and I do not know where it is and that I have to buy all the seed that my ground requires every year
And I think there is no remedy for that but to give the land at its value
 is my rent including rates
 s d is my rent
I can keep two cows but I have to buy from  to   worth of food for them and I myself spent between  or  for food for my family
I think the only remedy is to give us land at a fair rent sufficient to keep us comfortable
I cannot get return from my land of more value than  I have a stirk and if I feed it well I may get   for it and if it is not well fed I cannot get the half of that
I have about fourteen sheep off which I make from s to   per annum and the most of the crofters in my township are in the same condition
The fishing has been bad for the past few years so that there is no way for people to live unless they get help or land cheap and if the following year would be as bad as the present the strongest would be uppermost the weak ones would go to the wall
I have nothing further to say
I have not much reason to complain
There is a mill on the property
I had nothing to take to the mill
No I do not give it to them every year
It is not growing the place is so bad
The rain has denuded the soil and exhausted it so that it does not yield crop
We get a little return which is of use in feeding the cattle
The grass itself would not grow
That would not feed our cows in the winter though it might be of service in summer and autumn
No
I do not think I could
It is only peat soil
It is but  inch or  inches in depth of peat over gravel
Yes I was trying it first with the plough
Yes
Yes but it is getting shallower every year
No it is not so hard as that
Yes
That the land is too dear and too little of it
I was paying  s for a bit of ground
I could only keep one cow and I had a heavy family
I was six years continuously that I had to kill the six calves to see if I could get a cup of milk for the children for I could not keep them alive for I had no grazing on which to feed the cow I had no horsesee Appendix A
VII
The condition of both my neighbours and myself at that time
No Mr Gordon Macleod was the landlord then but Captain Macdonald is now the landlord
We got a little more land since
I got  or  yards breadth added to my croft for which I paid s of bare rent
I now keep two cows
There will be a good bit some scores of yards
Yes or more
Near 

Two cows but I have not got as much grass as would keep one sufficiently
We have hill
About forty in the township
There are some who have only one cow
There are full shares aud half shares in the township
I have half a croft
Yes
They are not allowed
Yes
About twelve or fourteen for my half share but the hill pasture is so bad
No
Yes
Oh to get the land cheaper and more of it to enable us to keep more stock
Plenty in the Isle of Skye
I do not know but there is a good deal
We want more hill pasture and more arable ground
No I have not but there are those in the township who have horses
Yes
Yes
Yes
I do not know that it is  they are complaining that the crop will not sow the ground
I would not be satisfied with the full croft as it is today for it is too dear
Yes I do
Yes
About half or a little more
It would give me enough to do to keep one horse and one cow and about twentyfive or thirty sheep
Half of the present rent
Yes
Yes I do
I cannot tell that as there is not room for them
I do not know but there is if it were well divided among them all
I do not know I believe they would not be very willing
They are too much attached to the old places
I do not know
Some of them have but I dont know
No
Duirinish
Twentythree or twentyfour years paying rent and altogether I have been about thirtysix years in this parish
Yes
I am not hearing
Very seldom
It is a long time since I heard of their writing at all
Spread them
Spread them over Skye
The one who preferred staying could do so and the one who did not could go away
No we had no idea of anything of the kind
No they have not money enough to stock larger holdings
They cannot have money to stock larger holdings
The most of them would not get a bag of meal on credit
No use unless they would get help
They will only die as it is
Should I get the land I have for nothing it would not keep me alive
I am not now a fisherman  I was a fisherman
Fortyfive or fortysix years
Yes
I have to say that my land is very high rented stony ground
Their cause of complaint is just the same as mine
Hard stony ground and part of my arable land has been cultivated during the whole time of my occupancy
We have no hill pasture
We are in a park surrounded by a dyke
Tenants who are above us on the hill and on the other side another park
Yes
About two miles further down
They have no living now in comparison to what they had when I was young
They have much trouble and toil working the ground which they had not then
There is not a man or a woman now but has to be out in spring working at the ground now and when they are done with the spade they have to drag the harrows themselves
No they did not
They had horses that would do the work of ploughing and harrowing
Yes they had plenty of meal and flesh some of them
Before they were spoiled each one would have from ten to twenty sheep four milk cows two stirks and two or three heifers to keep until the time for selling them  but now I must sell my stirk for want of a keeping place before the proper time for selling
We do not eat flesh at all
We have not the wherewith to buy any and we have no flesh of our own that we can eat
Fish meal and water and milk
I am not using much of it at any rate
There is not more whisky consumed now
I remember whisky being manufactured down here
From the Gairloch people they were very kind people but it is a long time since we have seen any of them
Yes some but it is a long time since the manufacture stopped
There is not a drop being manufactured now
No not a drop
Plenty of tea now
Yes in the poorest houses in the parish
Twice a day at any rate
Yes what can poor people do when they have not got anything else
They must take something to keep them alive
Not many  unless it may be some paupers
Some have a cow some two
More than fifty years ago
Mr Grant afterwards Lord Glenelg
Yes he was but factors were coming our way who were spoiling the place
These arc the people who spoiled the place before the Macdonalds got it
I remember the time of ten shares in the township being at   of rent each and a factor came who doubled the rent
That was before the Macdonalds became proprietors
He doubled that rent and took the seaware from us
They held the arable land in common
Before the Macdonalds time
Yes
Corry was the last factor and he was before the Macdonalds time and he made a dyke by the roadside
He made parks down below the road to the seashore
He moved the people who had the arable land and the grazing above down to that low land  and he placed two and three on each lot and ho put a sheep stock on the hill of which he deprived them
He took from them both sheep and horses  but there weretwo townships to the north end of that which he left as they were
Hallistra
No but these people became so poor that they could not pay the land and much of the land was wasted and the major had to move these people
No
No
Yes
Any land which the captain set to tenants since he became landlord he gave it to them at their own offer
No he has no tacksmen
Yes much more and had less rent than we pay now
About fifty years ago
Yes they are not gettiug richer at all by any means and these years have spoiled them entirely
I paid  between rent and rates at last Martinmas and six pecks of meal is aU that I made at the mill and I had to buy for my family
Yes  s of rent
Sometimes I keep three but I have to buy grass
Other crofters have it now  it is just above us
Yes I think so
There are many crofters now
Yes
Well the fishing has gone against us for the past two years
The Government should give some assistance for the erection of a pier here for fishermen pass out their lines in very stormy and dangerous weather
They are not in a position to get built boats with sufficient material
Yes it certainly would
They come from the east coast to fish at Barra  and if the fishermen here were as efficiently equipped as these they would be encouraged to do otherwise
I do not know that a fisherman would need to have land also
What would do the crofters good would be for them to keep a horse to help to till the ground
I would rather have a horse just now even should I only have one cow
I do not know
That is what I cannot say
I was not asking them about that
Five  one left us
Another one has got it
Another one of ourselves took the croft and he has now two
No I was born not far from the present township in a place called Reisagan
The ground officer is on the other side of me and other crofters
There is no way in which crofts which are enclosed in a park as we are can be increased unless by removing some of those that surround us
If we would get hill pasture  but the rent is heavy enough on us
Yes there is such hill pasture above us and in the hands of the landlord
Hallistra
Yes
I cannot say
No
I cannot say
I am informed that he has taken it as at this term of Whitsunday and I am not sure if he has got it yet
I cannot say much about that but their circumstances then were better than they are now
Yes much more
at Christmas
They dont have such now
Yes
Pipe We dont hear the pipe at all in the place now
Yes plenty of songs
Yes
The ministers of course were discountenancing it
The ministers wont be for the like of that at all
I did not ask the gentlemen  I cannot be sure
Yes many a time
There are indeed some trifling songs that people would not be much the better of hearing sung
You may be sure of that that their poverty is making them less cheerful
You may be sure that when a man is depressed with poverty he cannot be  cheerful
Yes
They were going willingly
 
Not so many now
No
No but I believe the commanders who have come from Skye were the best that ever crossed the seas
I do not think there are
There was a time when there were some
I do not know very well
I cannot understand it very well
Some enter the army yet perhaps hardships at home may compel them to list
Yes
Yes Major MLeod now living in Edinburgh
Yes
I would expect it to encourage them but that lad was considerably steady and he carved out a position for himself
I do not know any unsteadiness about them
If they dont they will not get work here
They must go to the south or die where they are
Yes it is in the south that the women earn most of what supports them
I dont know
I was not asking neither am I seeing any bad habits
I am not aware  I did not notice anything of the sort
I do not know anything about that I was not hearing
I do not know
I have not heard
I am not hearing so much about that now as I was hearing before
I think they are getting better now
We hope we will all be better of the Commissioners arrival here
If we are the worse of it it will be a bad business
Yes
Most of them are merchants and people who live in rented apartments
I do not know
No unless the merchants
The only other people are fishermen of the place who rent rooms
One thing is we would need to have a quay at any rate
I am twenty years paying rent
Not on the same croft
Yes it is they who sent me here
Captain Macdonald
That we are confined to small crofts and that we have no place on which to graze our cows other than at tether
It has a peg at the one end
We would like to have a bit of hill pasture for our cows if we could get it
The crofts which we have have been cultivated incessantly for the past eighty or one hundred years and are now exhausted
We cannot keep horses
We have no grazing for them and we have to do the harrowing ourselves
I need to use a double quantity of seed in sowing my land the land is so bad
I have no further complaint to make
We get a little seaweed for payment
I think if we had more land that would enable us to rest what we have been continuously cultivating
We would not require much see Appendix A
VII
The road passes my house
Nine crofters and the Captains herd
These nine pay rent
Yes very much
Yes above our houses the land which our forefathers had
Upper Hallistra
About fortytwo or fortythree years ago when the township was divided into lots
In the time of Major Macdonald Captain Macdonalds father
We asked it once or twice
We have done so this year
We have repeatedly spoken for an addition to our lots and grazing
He did not give us any encouragement that we would get it
In his own possession under sheep and cattle
The rent is very high for all that we can keep
To the best of my recollection it is the same rent still which is laid on the crofts
The present landlord did not raise the rent at any rate
Within two miles of it
Yes
The most
We would be fishing when there was nothing else to do
That is a port which the captain built for his own boats but he does not prevent anybody else from using it
They have full liberty to use it
There is a small quay they are working at
The fishermen land at the upper quay
No
At one time a good deal of fish was got in the bay but for some time past it has been going past
I cannot explain it but I think it is the hand of Providence
No
About  or  acres of all sorts but there is part of it under the name of land which is not cultivatable
It would cost from  to  an acre to trench it to make it good land
I think about  acres
Yes I have thought of that
Money would improve it
Some of the stones would take four or five men as strong as myself to lift them
I would need  or  barrels of gunpowder to clean the lot
It is by spending money on it
It would not pay for a long time to come
Most of my neighbours crofts are in the same state
I think my own lot is as bad as another with stones
No
They are not much better
Some of them are keeping only one cow
When I have a young beast I am obliged to sell it at the end of the year having no grass for it
 s of bare rent  s with  rates
Poor enough
There may be one man who has a cow and five perhaps may be claiming it
No but we are getting meal from the merchants in Glasgow and shoemakers and rent and everything
It may be that five may be claiming an interest in that cow and the value of the cow not able to pay them
Yes they are mostly in debt
In families in which there may be four young men working even these may have enough to do to clear their families
Since the potato failure
People have been poor ever since the land has been lotted and the pasture taken
We were poor enough but this year has sunk us entirely in debt
We were poor enough before so poor that we could not get a boll of meal on credit
Yes
We were not certainly the better of the deprivation of the hill
We need to sell the stirk at a year old having no place to keep it in
I might be able to winter another beast a twoyearold  but if I had more land I would be able to bring in another bit under cultivation
The place is so confined and the corn is so close to where we have to graze them that we must have them tethered otherwise they would be in our corn
There is no room to feed them otherwise
When they see the corn and the grass and they hungry there would be no keeping them back without the tether
We have no hill at all
The laird has a dyke to the roadside
On our crofts on that part of our arable land which we leave out for grass
Part of our ground is so bad that it will never grow grass and we leave that out
No nothing not  inches of hill pasture
To the ground officer and the ground officer hands it to the landlord
I never saw it otherwise but one year
Is d a hundredweight
A cart would not contain a scale
One hundredweight
Yes the drift ware we cut the seaweed for ourselves
It is not actually weighed but the ground officer points out the space of the seashore on which we are to cut the seaware
He is marking out a lot of the seashore on which each has a right to cut
The scale to which I refer is more than a cartload sometimes twelve to fifteen cartloads for Is d and at other times three and four
We measure the seaware in creels and there should be sixty creels in the scale
Some of us take s worth and others s d worth and down to Is as their families are able to manage
Yes
It would but where there are large families they will do the spring work in three or four weeks with the caschrom
Yes if there was fishing but the sea cannot be depended upon
The land is surer
I do not know
I never heard of that
Yes pretty often
When they dont work at the land they are working at fishing and at lobsters
Is for the ling I am not sure however
Some of the fishers do cure and send to Glasgow themselves
The boats are not bad they are improving
They are much better than they were in our early recollection
Yes
That includes all my holding
Yes
Yes
There is arable land outside of my holding what my forefathers had
Yes
He used to give some work
There was not so much work these last two or three years
Yes
Yes unless he goes south on business
Yes
The arable land was taken from us at the same time arable land on which they used to grow potatoes and corn
NAME
It would take a piece out of the landlords holding but he has a good deal more besides that
Yes marching with our township
No it is three or four miles from his dwellinghouse and some of it is six miles from his dwellinghouse
He keeps sheep and cattle upon it
Yes plenty parks and a big farm
Yes it would be better for us to be as we were before
We might be able to keep a horse and we might have a herd in common
Yes they lament it to the present day
Yes I understand it and that is the system which they regret at the present day
They had more land then
If we got common hill pasture we would be very well satisfied with that
We used to get fine homemade blankets at home that any person could sleep in and the clothes my wife would make I could appear in any where but now lam reduced to purchase south country made cloth which will not last a year
The food is pretty much as it was
We are getting meal from Glasgow and we use milk but our houses are too bare for want of clothingnight clothes especially
Yes
Yes if we would have such encouragement
We are considering our present land dear at its present rent
Yes we would do our best if we would not be removed out of it
The landlord was not given to eviction unless a person would do wrong but we have not such a good bargain
We are not the least afraid of eviction as long as we behave ourselves
I do not say
I speak for the part of the property on which I am myself
About eighteen years since I got it
My fathers were there for the last  years in the same farm and the same house
Yes
Yes three crofts have been added to it
Well two of them by my own desire and the other was vacant when I came home
I was abroad
Yes
Two one here and one at Valtos
Yes
Yes
Yes
No he lives in Kilmuir
Now and then
Yes one here and one at Valtos
Yes in summer time but not in winter
I do not know the population of this place but the population of the upper part which contains the upper school is about  people
I dare say there will be between twenty and thirty
No far from it
At Valtos
I think it is the same so far as I can make out
I do not know what is the cause of it
About this time of the year poor people are so busy and if there is any child that can herd and help the parents they will keep them at home when they are sowing and planting potatoes
After this the children herd the cattle and the men who are able to work will go south to earn their living and support their families
Yes there is nobody to look after them except the old people old men and women
No
Yes and there are bad roads and burns and the like of that
No
That is a thing I cannot make out
If the children were pressed to go to school they would go
No
As long as they wiU do anything about the place the parents will not send them to school
Yes
Not very often
I think so
Yes and every one of the members of the board is aware of it
They spoke to the parents but there was no use in that
No
That is a thing I cannot say  I do not think the parents will ever send the children to school till they try that
In some cases
They are as clever as children in any part of the world if they got a good education
I do not think it
Better schoolmasters but I do not think there are better scholars
We are paying school rates and we werenot paying them in the old time
Yes
Yes more of them certainly
No I do not think it
Well I cannot make out
I have seen many people from Skye going to the army and some got to high offices in the army but you will not see any youngsters now going into the army and that shows the people are falling back in Skye
No not in spirit
In circumstances
I daresay some of the young men would be better to leave the country
Well there are a great many of them leaving the country but we have plenty of land in Skye if it was given to us
We have thousands upon thousands of acres in Skye under sheep
I have sheep myself
Yes
Yes
I am quite sure of it
From one end to the other
Yes
Yes
Another is that when the people here got poor Captain Fraser had a ruleand it was a good rulethat every tenant should pay his rent at the term
Well poor people could not pay and they had to go to the bank to raise the money and perhaps they would have to pay interest to the bank and to the man who helped them to get the money out of the bank
Perhaps s d or s in the pound would have to be paid to that man
This was ruining the poor people
Perhaps one would borrow   this year and the next year for twenty years borrowing it that way
Yes lest the people would be moved off the estate
But Captain Fraser did not know anything about that
He was getting his rent from the tenants but he did not know they were getting it out of the banks or anything of that kind
Yes very much till lately
Now they cannot get money out of the banks at all
Well more lands and lower rental
Plenty of land
There are some patches of land on these crofts which have been turned for the last fifty or sixty years every year
Well I recollect forty or fifty years ago very well
Yes there were plenty of potatoes and plenty of corn
No
Yes
Most of them had full crofts then and now there are three families in most cases on each croft
Yes
Yes
Well I do not knowif they would get money from Government
The poor people cannot stock it now but they wiU never get on if they do not get more land
Well I think so
Not here they were not in want of it till now
I recollect when I was a little boy every farmer would kill a cow at Martinmas and also kill a sheep now and again and use their own eggs and everything but now they are selling everything to pay the rent
Yes
Yes
Bed clothes and everything they wore
Well it was strong Highland food that was used and it is far better to raise strongbuilt healthy people and a nice thing to have
Yes and fish and beef and mutton and plenty of butter and cheese
Very little of these
If a man has a wedder or two he will have to sell them
Nothing at all
No what would they do with tea
There is no beef no milk nor anything else and people going to the south and getting into the habit of drinking tea when they come to Skye  may drink tea in Skye

Upon Major Frasers estate marching with Lord Macdonald
Yes
Yes quite enough
I left home in  and went to Australia
My father then was paying  a year clear rental
There was no road money about that time
Now I am paying  a year but there are three crofts added to Loanfearn
Yes
When I got the two crofts they were   s each and the one croft was   that is  s
Yes
Yes
Yes Major Fraser gave me  down for the last two years
In the receipts it is only from year to year
No I never had a lease
No
No
No
I do not know
If I were as young as I am old I would not stay long in Skye
Yes
I do not think they can raise it higher than it is
Not the least afraid
It will not pay me or anybody else
It is too far from Duntulm
It is too far from Monkstadt
Not to small tenants
Yes I believe Mr Martin Snizort got money in that way to fence
The land here wants fencing draining and stocking
I never heard of the Government giving money for stocking in Great Britain
Yes in Australia
Yes
Yes
if the merchant would allow the man to sell the beast again he would sell the beast and give the money to the merchant and he has a right to do so
Yes
No but when the merchant buys the beast from the tenaut perhaps the meal is in Glasgow and perhaps the merchant does not know the price of the meal
No I dont think it is
I never heard of that being practised in Skye
If it was it was forgery
It is not
The want of a road and a postman is a great inconvenience
No
Major Fraser finished it to Loch Mealt and did not go further than that
Useless today
Two members
There are very few
Yes there is myself
At Portree
About nine miles from this
About thirteen miles
I think there should be one over at this side
Well some of them and others not
If would be the making of the poor tenants
Their sheep and cattle are dying
Herds are herding them all day and they will die with the rot disease
Dogs are after them all day and if there was any fence the sheep would get a rest
No
Yes but not in this country
Colbost
Eight years
I was employed as a tradesman in the low country
Yes certain
I remarked that they are a deal poorer since the day when I came here
In so far as their lands are not yielding maintenance for the people
That is one cause
And that land has been tilled perhaps forty or fifty years and it cannot be expected it will yield crops to support the people who are living upon it
Another cause that is evidently the case which was often spoken of today is the high rents we paid for these lands
Well I cannot remark anything regarding that only that they complain of poverty
If they would get more land and cheaper to keep them in employment and work in the country without running from place to place after the bite they had to get to support their families they would be better off
Well there is no doubt but that might be the case for since that began in the country there is a difference of feeling in that respect from what it was in my young days
I am certain of it
If they had lands to cultivate and keep themselves and their families at work at home and land that would support them with cheap rents such as would keep a family I believe they would be far better off than running to the low country every now and again
Well I think they would be as happy at home as in any of the colonies in the world
Give them the opportunity to work it out and if the land was overcrowded with more than it could support send them away to the colonies
I think they should get what lands are lying waste and the best lands in the meantime
Well that is a question that is very ill to answer
I believe there is plenty of land if it were only subdivided among the people that would support them in the meantime
If that were done just now we might just look to what is coming afterwards
I do not see that the meantime has anything to do with what is to come
Well if you give them the land and divide it rightly I have no objection to that
I think that is very right when it is done
But had not I a good right to that land for which my forefathers suffered death in wars protecting the country  Who should have a better right to that land than the heirs living in it although it is wasted with sheep and game and deer altogether For instance my uncle was brought out of his bed to go and defend this country and at the same time my grandfather was provided with a piece of laud that would support his family and at a very low rent
Now in a very short period after that he was removed from that and the land sold and my people sent abroad if they liked to go
And have not I a good right to claim that land now as the heir of my friend that suffered
From Colbost
He was taken by the laird MLeod of MLeod and when they were done he got the promise  but not only that he was removed from a different place for choice of land for the son at the time
I think the offspring had a good claim on these lands to get them
I am well aware that is partly what has done a little disturbance in the islandclaiming such claims on the land
Yes thinking they had a better right to it than strangers had or even to be put under sheep
I am not so well aware of that but there are some here who may perhaps know it
I know some in our own country MLeods country in the army
There are one or two from hereI believe in the army whom I saw at home once
Another thing that is very miserable in this place is the women working the work of horses at the time of owing and delving their croft
I am certain of it because they had horses to help them
I never saw any in my young dayswomen drawing a harrow till of late and I think that is horse work for any woman or man which is very common now in the islands
No
Yes but only in places where the plough could not go
Certainly the people had horses to plough but they have not any to plough now and they must use the caschrom
That is evident because in this district I do not believe I saw a pound of butter sold between Loanfearn and Deig in eight years and that is a good proof of the poverty of the country
There might be a little in Loanfearn but among the crofters I did not hear there was a pound of butter sold in all the district
They used to have a good supply to supply themselves and sell to others
In my own country but not here since I came
Yes
No not in this district
Well in my own days I saw the tenants keeping one for their own use that was all
Yes
Because they cannot feed them
That is my idea
Yes and fatten them on com seed when it came to the time of fattening
Well that is a very difficult question to answer
So far as I can see I cannot say anything in regard to that
I think there are people here as honest as I know of in the whole island if they had the means and so far as they go they are now almost ruined in regard to their honesty
I believe there is less but there is too much still there should not be any of it at all
Yes a good deal
That will be the case through time
It is young as yet but it has done a good deal
since I was born
I was born on the croft my father had it before me
Yes
I can say with truth that they were better off in my young days than they are now
Yes they were shod and clothed much better than they are today
I used to buy them
Yes we used to buy boots and make the shoes at home with thongs of leather
Yes doubtless
They can only live now by practising the utmost economy
I remember in my own township none of the families would need to go to borrow from another family
They were not in the necessity of borrowing anything when they were tenants of Lord Macdonald
We would be buying but very little at that time
Some families would not need to buy half a boll of meal from end to end of the year and there might be some families able to sell meal
Yes
They were making kelp at one time  those of the crofters who were living near the shore
No the Malagir people were too far up on the hill
They are not getting the use of the sea in any way
They have no road
Our children cannot go to school in bad  weather
Yes the whole district was entirely deprived of hill pasture and our stock are crowded in so that they arc spoiled
It was held in common by the different townships
No township was prohibiting another
It was a very wide pasture and was better than three times its own area
After our being deprived of the hill our rent was raised
It was more than doubled on us
Yes it was reduced by s in the pound but that is only the goodwill of the proprietor for the year
We have no assurance of its being continued
Unless we got the rent reduced to a sober rent we cannot hold up to it long
We will soon lose all we have
Our stock has got reduced and our money has gone
We were hearing of good news from Ireland
We were much inclined to turn rebels ourselves in order to obtain the same benefits
No I am not aware that anything of the sort took place
Yes
Rent risedouble what I have seen itand hill pasture taken from us
We had the same hill and when the hill pasture was taken from us we were ordered not to keep a single sheep
Two others and myself were taken to Uig
One is alive and one is not
We had there to put our names to a paper that we were agreeable to dispense with sheep entirelynot to keep a sheep at all and when we did so we had the alternative and giving up our holdings
When I came home  began to sell the few sheep I had and sold thern at s to s a head
I had one that I could not get sale for and I took grazing for it from Mr Stewart Duntulm in Flodigary island and I had the sheep there till Martinmas till I killed it
My land was then cleared and my neighbours were so treated
I was then seven years without a sheep or lamb
Then the proprietor allowed us to keep five or six in the upper part of the township
We then began to buy sheep and lambs
We now have two or three and they are spoiling our township on us
They are eating our crops as we have no hill pasture
It was permission
These sheep were not allowed to be a burden on anybody else
Then we were forbidden to keep horses
The work of the horses had then to be done by ourselves carrying everything on our backs especially so in our township
Our ground would be useless unless we took seaware from the shore to manure it with and I think I am for the past twenty years laying  creels of seaweed upon it each year besides my other work on the ground and the rest of the township is the same way and how can people keep up with such work
When I was a young man I could do it but we have to use hands and feet in ascending from the shore to our township
I may say that all this hard work is killing our young people for during the last eight years we have lost by death twelve of our finest young men and women
We were attributing their deaths to hard work but we cannot make sure
There are some in our township yet who have not yet a sheep or lamb
Some of these are so destitute of clothing that they are glad of getting a castoff oilskin being without clothes for day or night
If a man gets a good bag with his meal he converts it into underclothing and glad to do so
They are quite as much in want of night clothes
When we had the hill we had the wherewith to provide ourselves with good blankets and good clothing and our women would get employment in making them up
There are spinning wheels yet we have them yet
I may say that I know a man who was living near me who died at the age of one hundred and five years and who never wore cotton clothing nothing but homespunthe manufacture of his own wife and daughter
There is great odds between that time and the present
We are now clothed with south country clothing entirely
Some of the people spin yet
With the wheel any one of them who can afford to buy half a stone of wool
It costs us between s and 
It is very seldom that that is seen now
There are one or two at Deig
Yes
Though I have only two or three sheep myself I manage in a couple of years to provide myself with a pair of trousers off them besides stockings
Not more than Is d a yard
The weaving would cost d a yard and our own women did the spinning and dyed the worsted
s and s d
It was the work of the women which was making it so cheap and with bought dye it would be dearer still
But the women themselves were getting the dye stuffs at home off the rocks
Six or seven or perhaps nine or ten
We can dye with tea peat soot lichens heather tops and bark of willow but we do not use tea in making dyeit is too scarce a commodity
It is the manipulation of the woolthe waulking of the wool
Yes
Yes and the d is the actual weaving
We have hand looms
Seven or eight
Yes sometimes more than they can overtakesometimes without workaccording to the time of the year
One of us coming from the south country with our earnings buys perhaps a stone of wool and brings it home to our women to be worked up
No
No
Yes
I was ever without land in my present house
Yes but my people had land
Principally fishing very little work otherwise
Herring lobster and all sorts of fishing
No
It is on the crofters land
I do not pay for my house  but if I get a bit of land in which to plant potatoes I pay for it
Yes
Sometimes helping the crofters in their work
The house was built long before I entered
It fell once and I rebuilt it
The last time I believe I spent  on it
I speut that in money upon it besides the work of myself and family
It is a house of six couples with windows in the wall but no wooden floor
It was difficult for me to work it
I had a heavy and weak family
Yes sometimes if the fishing is a success
Doubtless we would make a good wage at it if we had convenience for saving ourselvesdrawing up our boats
There is a place down here which is as easy of anchorage as any place in Scotland
If we had a quay in any convenient place where it could be built
We have no boat that we could use at times when they should be used at sea for its size must be such that four men can carry it up the beach as soon as it touches
Yes well might they do it indeed
Yes near the end where it is coming to a narrow
We would
Yes helping to buy the boats and nets only we would need a place for them
They could buy such boats and nets if they got such assistance
These would be of no use to us without a place where we would draw them up
Yes
Yes
Yes as good as any place in the north of Scotland
Yes
A long time
About twentyfour
Four men to every boat
Not all there are many from Portree
s d a week and a percentage on the fish caught
Between  and 
Beginning at this time to the end of August
No
Yes
Three times a week
Yes
Lobster fishing the rest of the time
During the winter
Beginning at the new year or a little before until the beginning of spring
Yes
Long line fishing
Cod and ling and eels
Yes if we went out
We dont fish much beyond what we need for our families for we cannot yet a market for our fish here
Yes that is all
Some years better than others
Some years from  to  each of the four of us in the boat but we have to take our fishing tackle out of that
Sometimes noue other years eighteen barrels or so
Nearly twenty bolls a year
Eleven
Want of land out of which we can make a living without the necessity of going to sea
Yes but it is not a small croft we would need
Some years my earnings are more than others
We believe we are getting poorer like them
The place in which we are is so straitened
We are crowded into a space of one mile between two tacks on which there are twentythree families of us without land and the smallest family consists of three and the largest of eleven
There are thirtysix crofters besides on that strip of a mile and the place must needs be poor
I cannot say we are getting poorer in that way but that we cannot get the land
We cannot be more prosperous at the fishing
If we could get a good croft as I was referring to we would try and carry on both businesses
I have a family enough at home who would use the boat at the fishing
It is not long since I got my croft
My father was in it before me but not in my present croft
Yes
The smallness of our holdings heavy rents and the insecurity of tenure
We are marching with another property Lord Macdonalds and no march between us but a small burn
Three townships lie between us and Valtos
Yes
Two lots of the township were cut off us and the best part of the grass and another piece of arable land that the township had in common with others near the shore and which was of much service to us because we had ware connected with it
No we cannot reach it
We live on the far end of a peat moss the four lots which have been left to the township
We are without a roadway there through the country or to the seashore
At this time of the year when the weather is good and the sea fine we can get our goods conveyed by boats but in winter we have to travel  miles over the hill for the necessaries for our families and we have to carry everything on our backs over the hill without roads or bridgesover rivers and sometimes people are lost in these burns
Several years ago a person was lost in one of these burns
Yes
About  miles
If we had a horse we could carry our necessaries on horseback if we had carts we could take them to the march of Valtos
About   miles
Valtos
Those who are strong
We have no road
In winter when the burns are swollen they cannot attend
Yes
Occasionally
He comes pretty often
Yes getting poorer yearly
No
I believe fish could be got if the sea were accessible 
No port
There is no safe place to haul up the boats between this bay and Portree
Yes and possibly nearer Portree than this
I have seen quays made in wilder places
I cannot say about that
I have no idea what such work would cost
Yes
To the smallness of our holdings and the inconvenience and difficulty of access to the place
I believe it is attributable very much to the excess of rent
Before the rent was increased upon us we were in pretty good circumstances
Since that time unless each year will meet the expenditure of that particular year we have to encroach upon our stock little by little until the stock is exhausted
Last year I believe has occasioned considerable loss for the crop was lost by storm
I dont remember such a bad year as last year
There are seven families located on these four lots
I believe they belong to the place
Yes
Yes I was in circumstances at one time that no man could crave me for s of debt
Fifteen or twenty years ago
Before then I was always comfortable
Yes
I come against my will very much because I have not been long in my present place
No only that if I had been longer in the place I would be able to say more about it than I am able to say
The first inconvenience is the high rent that is exacted from us and the land not being worth it
In the second place we were deprived of part of the cows grass and by that we were cut off from watering for our cattle
There is no water convenient for our cattle
We lost also a path which we used to enter the piece of grazing which we have
We were not making the most off our land owing to the insecurity of our tenure
We did not know but we might be deprived of our holdings as well as the grazing
If they did the one they might do the other
We were only putting the ground in heart to the extent that we would exhaust in one year and these are the principal hardships which we were suffering at the hands of the landlord
There was such
That any one who would be known as a leader of any movement would be warned
A deceased brother of my own said to me that he was warned for such a cause and he was deprived of his land and could not get the land during his life afterwards
Nothing
No other cause than that he nominated along with other nominators a member for the school board
I think it was at the first election of the school board because the factor said that the landlords list of members for the board was complete and that he preferred to have these and my brothers nominee was left out
There was no poll
Another man in KilmuirDonald Nicolsonwas hardly dealt with
It was in possession of my father and after my fathers death in that of my mother and then in my brothers possession until deprived of it as already mentioned
That is the only cause which my brother told me
Yes although there was no poll it was done to him after all
My opinion is that at any election of school board there would not be more than twenty voters present perhaps not half that number
They got warned also but they were not deprived of their land
Two of them were warned at any rate
Yes
I was never so threatened but I hear that others have been so
Yes
That is throwing the crofters there far back and leaving us without work in winter when we might be employed improving our crofts
l believe that that is the case and we are more afraid of such parties than of the landlord
We are not the least afraid that if our landlord knew our circumstances well he would give us justice
They are a limited number
There were no residents in this quarter who ever prospered so well as they and to the disadvantage of other people and of this township itself
Yes that is the opinion of the most of the people
It is our belief
We are not absolutely sure but it is our belief
Yes tacksmen not only possessors of a tack but of tacks
Yes and I myself particularly would do so and much need of my doing so
Yes and the stones should be utilised in drains and dykes
Yes without having the rigs going one way and another
That is what we want to do
Yes but they will not because if they improve their crofts their rents will be raised or they will be removed
I have to complain of how the grazing was taken from us and that the summing is greater than the land will support
We are particularly inconvenienced for want of water for our stock owing to the loss of the piece of grazing of which I have spoken
The river adjoins our arable land and when it is under crop we cannot let the cattle get at the river
We had a piece of grazing that was marching with this river and that was what we were deprived of
I was born and brought up in Delista Kilmuir which is within six and a half miles of Borniskittag
We were removed out of Delista about eighteen years ago to the township near it called Graulin
We were seven crofters in Delista and twelve in Graulin
We were removed all of us cottars and all none were left
We were scattered over the estate some to east side some to Kilmaluag some to Kilmuir
These townships were added to Monkstadt
Three of the Graulin cottarstwo at all eventswere placed in Borniskittag and another of them was placed in Totescore
Four crofters were removed from Balgown which is next to Delista
Then the township of Feaull adjoining Graulin was cleared
There were two families in Feaull
One of these left of their own accord and the other had to give up the place owing to the excessive rent
After that Lachsay was cleared
One teuant had it
The land was added to Duntulm
There was one tenant in it and two other families
The township of Scorr adjoining Lachsay was cleared of two families
The township of Osmigary was next added to Duntulm but there were no crofters on it
The lots in Borniskittag were as numerous in my early recollection as they are today
But I have been told by old persons that it was occupied at first by a small numberfrom four to sevenand the township lands were more extensive theu than now
That is what the old people were saying
They were placed in other townships on the property
They were placed for the most part on land which was run outwhich had been exhausted by their predecessors
They were placed in occupancies which had been vacated by crofters who had been compelled to leave through the poverty of the land and straitened circumstances in consequence and others of these removed tenants were not able to take crofts at all and have become cottars
That is my history of them
Twentyfour families in all
So far as I remember my own father was one of them
Sixteen years or thereby
Yes
General goods meal all sorts of merchandise required by the people about
They have been buying less of some sorts of goods and more meal
Less cotton and clothing
Part goes into other groceries
I buy less groceries myself now than formerly
I buy less for the supply of the people
They are less punctual now
They cannot be otherwise they cannot pay punctually
Yes  more than ever
I know that they have got poorer
Yes I know there are families in want
Making the blankets themselves
There are many of them who through poverty have no sheep
The end of the district where I reside has not been deprived of hill pasture
I am not able to answer for this part
Others can speak to that but I am given to understand that it is the best part of the hill pasture which was taken from them in so far as they were deprived of hill pasture
The people made use of the wool themselves they were selling but very little of it
Yes
Yes
There is no road into it
On the backs of the people and horses in creels and burdens
About half a mile
Yes
The post office is about four miles away from the upper part of this district
Yes and to send their letters also by messenger to the post office
No there is not a paid runner
Yes
About fifteen or twenty years ago and it is one of the causes to which the poverty of the people is to be ascribed
The landlord rules them so strictly that payment in full must needs be proffered at the rent day
If only part of it were offered it would not be taken
So far as I know
No not at that time until the present yearsuntil the people were not able to pay
Yes some of the parties who used to give their securities on these bills have not been paid
Yes  but some securities were so favourable to them that they did not push them so far
There were some people getting money out of banks here who had not a head of stock
Plenty
Yes
I do not think that
I am not aware of any but fishing
Only to a few
We never see him
We have seen him occasionally down the way but we were not seeing him often
I am not aware that he did
At the rent collection
He comes to school board meetings
He is a member of the school board and parochial board and comes to attend these meetings
The beast will be marked when it is bought
Yes in a few instances
Yes
I pay the man for the wintering of the beast in addition to the price of it
Yes that is the purpose for which it is bought
It is not for the boll of meal that the beast is security but for the value of the beast in meal
I would prefer the money
I would not wish a beast from any man who had got the money
To the last market of the yearthe September market
NAME
I only want my debt out of it
If the man gets any body to give more than I give for it I give up the beast
It is I who must deliver the beast to its new purchaser and the money must pass to me for fear of its being lost to me
No it is to relieve the people and for the peoples convenience that I enter into such transactions as they will not get relief anywhere else
Eleven who pay rent
They have complained about the piece of hill pasture that was taken away from them
I am a crofter myself
I am one of the eleven
It is from this end of the township that the hill pasture was taken and our sheep are consequently crowded together on the remainder
Sixteen years ago
I am not aware why it was taken from us
It was added to the Duntulm tack
Our rent was not reduced unless it was reduced in the case of the parties from whom the hill was taken
Deig Glasfin and Brogaig
Yes
No
No it is common hill pasture
Yes
According to the old people with whom I have been speaking at one time my township was in the possession of one crofter
I do not know what he was paying but afterwards the township was divided between eight crofters paying 
 s
That is the highest without the abatement
s in the pound
Yes
I am a native of that township
Yes
Yes I believe there is no one who knows it better
Yes I kuow that by experience
There are several causes
Buying the meal is very heavy on them the rent is high raising money out of banks the inconvenience of the place for bringing things into it
They cannot get things to buy as cheap as they can get them in other places more accessible
Yes
I have stood it yet
Nobody has lost by me yet
Yes I consider the beast mine and if the beast gets lost it is my loss
Yes
Yes
We make an agreement about the price first
Not the price of the meal because there is no knowing what the price may be during the year the man does not take with him at one time the value of the beast
Yes in the case of some
He is not the least afraid that he will not get the meal
In the cases in which I mark beasts as security the party is already far in my debt
No but for present and future relief
I will put it to his credit
Three shillings for good tea
I do not know
Yes
Not this year
Yes
No I never dealt in it
I do not know what the consumption may be but there are some here who may tell about that
I have a further complaint to make
I have to complain of the way our marches are open between ourselves and the neighbouring tacksman
We have applied to the landlord to put a fence between us and the neighbouring proprietor
We did not get a reply from him
We had two herds during the past year
We do not expect to be able to have a herd at all this year because some of the people have become so poor that they are not able to pay their share of the herd
We do not know what to do with our stock
We cannot keep them from trespassing on Scorrybreck without this fence
Yes we would pay a part
We told him we would agree with any terms he would lay upon us
Some of us would do that but those who cannot pay even a herd would find some difficulty in doing anything
We have no road or postoffice
Our township again is in two halveshalf up towards the hill
We keep our cows there
We cannot use the manure from there for the use of our arable ground
We have no road from the shore to our arable ground
We have to carry the seaweed on our backs and with horses and we pay road rates without grumbling
We applied for the piece of road to Loanfern to be repaired the road that was laid out by the destitution committee before and it was at that time suitable for conveyances
When the last Road Act came outa few years ago
It was not paid in name of road rates  it was paid with the rent
The rates are besides the sum I have mentioned
The doctor was included in that sum but not the rates
At Uig
When we send for him in a case of sickness it might be two or three days before we would see him and sometimes he does not make his appearance at all
About  or  acres
Yes there is a kind of pasture
Six cows one horse and about twenty sheep
That is the summing for the whole croft
I have a half croft
The whole croft
Half a croft
Two cows
Yes
About seven or eight
None over a year and the sheep have gone entirely this year
 s for my half croft
That is the highest rent
There was a permanent abatement of   s d two years ago and s in the pound beyond that
It is to be taken off that
Yes
Yes we got  s in the pound
We pay rates upon the old rent
 and Is or s
It has
A piece of the pasture was taken from the one end and that overcrowds the rest of the township
No  the best of it went
No I never heard of the rent being reduced but always being raised
That was taken off nowhere the authorities had gone wrong in the summing
 s for the half croft in which I am now
Before Captain Fraser became proprietor of the estate
They have enough to complain of in the high rents that are exacted and the increase of rents
They had quite enough to do as the rents were before that increase
More land upon which they can make a living without having to go away from the crofts to other places they cannot remain at home More than a month in spring and a month in harvest with poverty
About the marches
We do not get justice about the marches
When the sheep are poinded perhaps they will be two days in a pinfold before we get notice and still paying  money for them
A great many of them die with poverty and pook in the winter as happened this year
Yes
Yes more than twenty years
For a while of the year
About four months
In the summer up to the middle of September
In the beginning of winter
To every place where I can best find employment
I was not from home last year
About Badenoch
Until it was time for the spring work
I would not take much money home from any place during the short winter day but I make a good wage off the fishing
Yes
I must go from home as the land wont support us
I did not make a boll of meal for the last eight years on my land
Yes and were it not for that It would have been long since I were in my grave with starvation
Yes worse than any that has come yet
Because I had a sick family
I lost in one year almost everything I had in the world
Yes
From  to  acres of arable land
Ten cows two horses and fifty sheep
From  to 
A river in part and a dyke or something
Yes if they were allowed
Yes if the river were followed
Yes
It would give us a good bit more
We could not get a fence with poverty
The proprietors never made any endeavour to put up a fence and we considered that as it is the estate march the proprietors should have a fence there
On this side Major Fraser and Lord Macdonald on the other
Mr Stewart Scorrybreck
He was doing part of that and his predecessor was doing the same
We paid in one day about   to Mr Stewarts predecessor in the farm
Mr William MLeod
We heard no complaints but we had a herd and he had a herd by the marches
It was added to Duntulm
It was Mr Stewart who had the farm then
Yes and if it was good it would have been taken away
Eleven
They are not the same
Six families
Some of them from other townships
One from Loanfearn another came from Garos another from Balmeanach
Others belong to the place
The one from Loanfearn was added to the farm of Loanfearn
The one from Garos had no lands there
The Loanfearn one was added
A separate farm
About 
The present tenant Murdo Nicolson
They are poorer than I can tell
It is hardly credible
When they go for a boll of meal from the dealer the animal the dealer has to get for it must be marked before they can get the meal
Yes
It is a poor place that does not give a return
They were not the better of it
It did contribute
It is the rents that brought us first to poverty
We were in good circumstances until then
Yes very heavily
There was one year we lost everything
Everything was blown over into the sea Their crops were delaying the progress of the vessels in the sea
Yes it would
I do not think there is any place on our shore  but there is a place down here where it could be done
At Staffin
It would not be very handy to them but it would be better than wanting anything of the kind
It would do a great deal of good to us if steamers were calling
There is nothing of that kind with us
We have not even a road and we pay road money
The road just reaches the march of Valtos
There was a road a number of years back but it was allowed to go into disuse
No
Three times
About twentysix years ago
Yes
Yes but we did not think that that was to come on us
No if we had done so we would not have signed them
About ten years ago
More than 
Five shillings for the doctor
About six years ago
From  s to  s altogether
All in the same way
They went to Uig and refused to sign for this increase
The factor asked us to try it for a year
We were paying it for two or three years after that until we found the burden too heavy for us
Yes
He threatened to remove us altogether if we did not pay the increase
We got a slight reduction
 s d
Yes
Yes
On the big rent
I do not know but we give them to the factor
He did not make any roads for us
We have to carry everything on our backs
He carried the road so far as it suited him but no further
About twelve years ago
Yes and we had it up through our place though it was not valued
Yes and further
It reached Loanfearn
It was made to Loanfearn by the destitution committee but to the march of Valtos it was finished by Captain Fraser
I cannot tell
About  miles
Hardly  mile
He left more than  miles of it unfinished
Yes
Yes
There is no other road whatever
I do not know of any
I do not know of any except the inn
The inn down here
Yes
He did not make any houses for his tenants
No I do not know of any improvement
Here
Yes
No
Many a loss
It is in name of him
I heard complaints about that
I do not know of any except that I hear from people who go there
I do not go there
I did not grind any for the last eight years
I had none
Every grain
From a dealer beside myself at times and from the south at other times
I am eleven bolls out since last Martinmas
Seven
About as much again
s and s
They are poorer than I can tell
They are in want of clothes and in want of food
Yes
Plenty of them are in want others have them
Yes
Perhaps they have bags over them at night
Yes and cannot go to school for the want of them
I cannot say
No
They will not come our way for the want of a road
No they make no good to us
I have nothing more to say
Four and a half acres or thereby
Two cows
No sheep
No horses
For forty years
I desire to say something besides what has been already said
We had the hill pasture along with our arable land in old time always until the captain came and now we have the rent much increased double what it was without the hill at all
It was divided between Duntulm and Monkstadt
We are continually getting poorer since we lost the hill
Old people and young people have no means of living
Young strong men can earn what will provide them with clothing in the south but old people and young people cannot do that and now the most profitable land that we had in our townships is under sheep connected with the big tacks and we understand they were all productive townships
We understand that the land was good land when we could get ten returns for our corn and these families could only get two and a half returns in the land to which they were removed
We have not got sufficient land now to enable us to cultivate it in rotation
The township in which I am now my father and his brother and another man had it to themselves and now there are fourteen in it
You can easily see that if feeding of three individuals was apportioned to fourteen it could not be too scarce
We are undergoing all the exactions that were laid upon us in quietness
The rent was raised upon us and we had the alternative offered us of leaving the place or to pay the increased rent
We are very needy now that the rights of our fathers and grandfathers should be restored to usthat is the hill pastureand it was the want of that that brought the great poverty upon the township of Kilmuir
If crofters who are huddled together now in small holdings were spread over the old crofter lands which are fertile there would be more comfort and the big tacks would still remain
I am getting old and cannot do much for myself now and it is our families who are looking after us when we are getting old and this is disgusting them from the landthe poor soil they have to deal with
They cannot get so much out of the laud as a pair of stockings
When we had the hill should we only got that itself out of it it would be so much help
We cannot tell the inconveniences to which we are subjected through the loss of the hill
The croft is  acres and I think half is arable land and half grazing
It is only a year since I got possession of this lot and I was told the summing was two cows
It is four cows for the full lotno sheep and no horses
The third part is laid out for grass
The croft was  full rent before I entered it
Yes my original rent was  
Yes
I cannot say about the hill pasture as I have only been in possession for about a year
Yes
I can only speak as to my previous holding the holding I had before I entered this one
In the neighbouring township Feaull
Feaull was divided into nine crofts and was occupied by nine tenant farmers paying some   some  and some  a croft
In my furthest memory the total rental was 
I had more than one croft
I had five crofts  and I paid  and a few shillings
It is two years ago
Yes three times
We had the whole township at first and then there was a soninlaw put in with us and he got four of the crofts and he was paying 
I recollect of the whole crofts being with the rights of hill for   and then before I left the place the rents came between myself and my brotherinlaw to  odds and the rents were raised thrice in my recollection
Yes
Yes
It was put on at three times
Two rises of rent were put on my father and one on myself when I got in
About five years ago in my recollection
The arable land was not increased but the hill was taken away
It was reduced a little the first year and then they raised the rent two years afterwards
There was just s a croft of reduction
A great deal
No
No
I had to give up that place owing to the increase of rent and I got the promise of this croft
I occupy the half of it now and I was two years without land and then I got that half last year and once I possessed that croft the half of it was taken away from me
It went to another tack Monkstadt
I cannot say
The house I occupied cost upwards of  to my father and when I left it it was valued at 
By the ground officer and another man
Yes
It was
About thirty years to my recollection
Stone and lime
No thatched
Yes very good
I cannot say because it was left to themselves I got just the account
Well I had to put up with it

One Mr Clow
A tenant and a joiner
He was a miller lately
I went into the old house
It was an old publichouse
Yes when it was built first but there was not much of that to be seen when I entered it
Yes
I got lime from Glasgow and I had to fetch timber
About  or 
I had a great grievance to go
I was paying high rents with my father and keeping cattle and paying a good deal of money and I was sent to that croft with the promise that I would get the whole of it and the half of it was taken from me
My mother was here before me eightyfour years of age and my forefathers and paying honestly and without being in arrear to the factor or proprietor
I am put on six and a half acres with twelve of a family and the oldest is seventeen and the youngest about two months
Well I dont consider it reasonable because nothing was taken off for the licence being taken to another place only the abatement that the whole of the people got of s in the pound
Yes only the abatement
Yes
Yes
I gave it up because the rent was so high and my brotherinlaw gave up
One Mr MMillan
He was taken to another croft
Likely it was at least I do not know
My mother was promised the whole of the lot
She is not long with me at Kilvaxter
No
Yes
Yes
They kept the half of it for MMillan
Yes along with another one
Yes there were different places that were removed
There were Graulin Delista Benore Feaull Glachasay
There were twelve families in Graulin and six in Delista three at Benore and nine at Feaull and three at Glachasay and three at Scour
Most of them are down in Kilmuir and some abroad
Part of it
It was added to Duntulm
Yes
Within my own recollection
Yes
Yes
Yes
No I never had a lease
Yes
To tell the truth I would not ask a lease but I would ask security against people being removed as long as they paid their rents and did not annoy their neighbours
By the law
Whatever direction it would come from it would give something reasonable that the poor people would live upon
We would be thankful to see it
The Government
I would leave it to the Government
Yes I am well acquainted there
That would be according to the family they had
Between  and  worth
Yes including grazing and arable land
Six milk cows a horse and a score of sheep
Willingly
That is according to the valuation of the ground
There are more acres under sheep that are worth double the run the poor people have
About ten or twelve acres with the grazing besides
Yes very well
Quite sufficient
I cannot say that
Many of them could be created upon the tacksmens farms
It is quite visible that the crofts are still there with their marches to be seen going through the country
That is a thing hard to say
People have come to such a poor state that they could not unless they were supported in some way or other
I do believe it
I thoroughly believe that and another thing I know there are a few clever men who would do it and the most of them are very honest people
Yes perfectly well
Yes
Yes
No mistake about that
In my own recollection they were better fed because they had sheep and horses and cattle
I would not have to go far before I would get scores of cattle where I cannot get a dozen today
Decidedly when they had plenty of stock
They did
Very seldom very few
I remember well the place was occupied by a great many more people when these towns were not lifted and there were large tacks at that time
Yes
They were not so large
There were some
I have heard my mother and my father speak about them
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
No
Yes it is as follows   Statement of Facts
Larger holdings  security against evictions and raising of rents  hill pasture for sheep and horses lands to be valued by the Government land laws to be changed to prevent the removal of tenants as long as they pay their rents right to cut seaware
About  or  acres
Three cows and it would not do justice to two
That is all
No sheep we have no hill pasture
 s now
It is thirtyone years since I came to it
 s was the rent before the last reduction
The rent is put down at  s and the last abatement was  s d which leaves  s d
 s and the hill pasture included in that
It is in the receipts that I produce
She was an aunt who was with me on the holding
Yes for the same
Yes
Eight
Yes  there were always eight tenants but not all the same rent
Eighteen years ago
About twenty sheep three cows and a horse
Yes
It was divided between the tacks of Monkstadt and Duntulm
No
Yes for the rent
Yes if we would get the hill
No we have no way of doing that
Yes  but not now
Before now we would get a removal if our rents were not paid
No we have not paid it altogether this year yet
Yes
No
Yes we were paying the rent when it was dearer than what it is now
Yes
I think we would
What is the use of that when the grazing is not grazing and when the land will not give crop
Yes
We ceased to work on the land when the rent was being increased upon us
No
It lies on the beach where it would be easy for us to cart it home
The tacksman is not cutting the seaware at all
We dont ask it of him
We dont ask it
I never did so myself
We think it would do us good to have the right
I do not know
Not altogether
Some of the crofters have got right to part of it
About a mile and a half or so
Yes
So far as I am aware
No it is only one man who paid the whole rent last year
I do not know
NAME
Yes that is just the case
The croft was  s that would keep twenty sheep and the twenty sheep were taken away and we were charged  s
Yes s doctors money is included in the  s
Mr Brown
Yes
Yes
Thirtyone years
Yes
No
It is two years since I got my present croft
Balmaquien
I married and left
I am in my own house and lands

Off the sea for the most part
That itself is a great reason
Potatoes and fruit of the earth as others have
If we had more land we would not risk our lives at sea in rough weather as we now have often to do
Yes it would be better for us
Yes
Yes I agree with what he has said
A man named Malcolm Macpherson
After him two had it
Then it was in Lauchlan Mackays hands
They all came in at once
From Duntulm
They were removed from Duntulm tack
I cannot say
They were merely cottars on Duntulm
Yes they built their own houses
It was John by the landlords ordersthe landlord and factor
Thirty or thirtyone years ago
When the subdivision was made
I cannot say what the rent was when the subdivision actually took place but the rents actually were raised in proportion as the rents of other townships were raised
I cannot tell
It was not I who had the lot at that time
The people are not at home
Some are not able to work
The people are away from home fishing  at the fishing at Shetland Lewis and elsewhere
Twentythree shillings and a few pence  but there are some of them that pay more than that
One and a half acres
I take a little potatoes out of it and a little corn
The seaware and driftware on the shore
Yes we fish lobsters in winter
It is better than this but it is a wilder coast
The land is there as we ever have seen it round us
Duntulm tack
It is all in one mans possession at any rate
I cannot say
We are not allowed to cut either rushes or heather without leave
He is not refusing it at all
He would give it to the people who would go and ask him
He is not asking payment
There are some who cannot get it though there are others who get the privilege
There may be some who do not deserve the privilege  there are others who do
There may be some who are not able to give work to the tacksman in exchange
If you put work before us we would do it
For pay
He is asking that
No they are not allowed to keep a cow
South country meal and treacle and tea and sugar
The land we have is not capable of supporting a cow
I never asked it
It is a new tacksman we have now
This is his first year
We could not get that privilege from any of the present tacksmans predecessors
Yes
There is no township without being in debt and we are in debt also
I do not know any who are not in debt
Yes  Kilmaluag Skye th May  To HM
Commissioners Uig Skye
GENTLEMENWe the undersigned cottars residing in Kilmaluag Skye humbly beg to submit a few things for your consideration
We would humbly desire your efforts to procure on our behalf a piece of land from which we might derive some benefit for the support of ourselves and families
Work is not to be had here and it is very hard on us to procure the means of sustenance
We would desire land at a fair price sufficient to grow potatoes for us and to enable us to keep a cow and a few sheep
We have been accustomed to work on the goodwill of the tenants amongst us but they themselves are in so poor circumstances and in want of more land it is hard on them to supply us
We have also great difficulty after receiving land to put manure on it having to carry it often a mile and sometimes two
We would also desire a right to cut seaware for at present it is a great favour if we get it
We approach you hoping you will consider our case and your efforts in our behalf will be thankfully acknowledged by your obedient servants HECTOR MKENZIE family eight JOHN MPHERSON nine ROBERT MATHIESON seven ALEXANDER STEWART ten EWAN MLEOD five JOHN MDOXALD three DUNCAN LAMONT four DONALD M KAY two ALEXANDER GRANT ten
We have no work to do in our locality
We have to go to the fishing
No but we pay a little to the crofters for the bits of ground we get from them and many of them are giving us bits of land for nothing
From Is to s
I pay for the bit of land we pay nothing for the stance of the house
As much as will plant half a boll of potatoes
Yes
Where the land is most plentiful
Yes a croft as much as I can work
I would be satisfied with  or  acres grazing for a cow or two and a few sheep
We would be satisfied with a cow and a few sheep but some of us would take up a larger holding
Yes I could do that by my own  industry and my earnings
Yes  I applied twice to the factor and did not get even a reply
Yes every one whose name is on that paper
Off the sea
I have no other source
I have no cow or sheep
Yes I am in debt
Yes I heard many of the witnesses
I am aware of that
I think that I have a greater cause of complaint but doubtless they have a heavy cause of complaint
They are weighed down with heavy rents and bad years
We would aspire to a little in hopes that we would light upon the great
I cannot say much for I am much straitened in the circumstances in which I am not knowing where I can put manure and I would be very thankful to have less or more land in order that I might be relieved from the pressure of circumstances
Yes but it is hard altogether to enter into a big croft and the burden so heavy
It would be better to climb to it bit by bit It would be better to attain to the big croft bit by bit
On the east coast
About ten weeks back and forward
No I work as a hired man on wages
No but I go along with my neighbour in the boat belonging to him
 feet keel and  feet beam
No it is generally lobster fishing through the winter and spring
Nothing to do
No we have to plant a small bit of potatoes to supply our families and we have to cast peats after that and we are waiting again for a month or so till the east coast fishing commences and then we go there
Well we get some saith but there is no herring to get about our coast now
Yes they commence in January sometimes if the weather be favourable but our coast is very rough and sometimes we cast the lines and it is impossible for us to go for them again for the roughness of the weather and the tide is so strong as to sweep them away
No
 for the season and s per cran
Two hundred crans sometimes
Two hundred and seventyTwo crans
I got these three last years seasons very good
No I was never so far down as fifty crans
The fewest number I had was one hundred and thirty crans
I got at the beginning of the season from s to s and at the latter end of the season ls a dozen
Mr Roderick Macdonald and Mr Robertson here bought them and carried them from Kilmaluag shores to Portree
Some days we have a dozen or a dozen and a half
Some days six or seven
I cannot calculate that just now
About 
About  or 
The lobster fishing was not happening in our place at that time but more than twenty years ago or seventeen years the first lobster fishing came to our place from London
Yes
The earnings on the fishings are more than they were twenty years ago but there are more calls for expenditure by having a family to support
We have a want of materials boats and nets and harbours
At our place it is a very bad harbour running boats upon the beach and rough shore
Yes
Yes
Maybe it would happen and perhaps if we lost the material and boat altogether we would come to a total loss
Surely a good chance there is nothing like it
No I dont think it
The Skye fishing is very far back now
I believe I could especiaUy for three months in the summer time
No because the fishing is working from the th or th May till the th June and then we leave home for the east coast fishing on the st July
No it is impossible because we have to cut seaware and put it on to the ground  have not a particle of seaware for myself at all and we have perhaps to go round and get some elsewhere
I think it would be more profitable to go to the Stornoway fishing
Just quays
Yes one that would make a shelter in the bay
Portree is the nearest one
Yes
It is very difficult to get one at Kilmaluag
Yes it would be easy to make one at Duntulm but Uig is the only place for a quay because it is smooth water always there is no heavy sea rising there
No
On Mr Munros ground the innkeeper at Kilmaluag
There is a want of that unless we buy milk from the neighbours here and there
 We get it only a very few weeks in the summer
None
It is very hard on the part of the people to support a family without milk or sheep or anything of that kind
Oh yes
It would be very useful through the summer time at the herring fishing but there is no harbour in the place to keep it here through the winter
Yes that is the nearest place to save a boat in the winter time
It is my fathers name which is in the rental book
He is an old man of eighty
I heard and understood the most part of it
Yes but I would add that it would be more profitable to us to have the hill pasture than the arable land if we could not get both
Because we could keep more stock of sheep and a horse if we got back the hilL Then if we had the assurance that our rents would not be raised or ourselves removed we would have encouragement to improve our holdings better than we do
I am not for finding fault with the landlord at all but I find fault with the land laws because if I should improve my holding the landlord can have my improvements valued to increase the rent and if I dont pay such a rent I will be warned and sent off at the May term
And what causes greatly our poverty is the way in which our land has been tilled for the past many yearscropping incessantly with the same same kind of crop to feed our stock to keep our stock in fodder in order that we may be able to pay the rent There is much of our land that will not yield fodder for our stock unless we manure it with seaware
We have no right to seaware and we can only procure it by favour of those who have such right
We are not on the shore
If we had the land at a reasonable rent and as much of it as we could cultivate in rotation we would be much more comfortable and able the better to pay the landlord
We had no heart to improve our houses owing to the way in which we were left by the operation of the land laws
Drains trenching digging out the stones and although we have our croft in name of arable land there is much of it stony and wet
I am telling the truth
Yes and I would do more in that way were it not for the increase of rent
I cannot say that it was but I know some whose rent was raised after they had improved their lots
Yes
Yes
Yes
I was not personally myself taking interest in it but if the others to whom I refer took in any new land it would not be profitable to them when the rents were raised upon them in consequence
Yes
Not long after
Yes doubtless
Yes
Yes
 Yes but if we had a promise that we would not be removed that is the only lease we would be wanting
Twelve years
We would not ask a landlords lease if we only got a promiseif we only got assurance we would not be removed or our rents put up on our improvements
No
These parties took no more of the land than I did and there was greater reason in their case to increase the rents than in mine
I have nothing further to add
Since
A delegate from South Cuil
Yes
It is as follows  We the tenants of South Cuil eight in number beg to state our grievances and our demands before the Royal Commissioners which are the following  We want an increase of land our lots being inadequate to support our families
 The ground is so weak by perpetual tillage that it does not yield crops as it was wont to do the weather haviug very much changed of late years so that the fertility of the ground is washed down by incessant rains towards the Uig Bay
 We also respectfully request a permanent lowering of the rents fixity of tenure compensation for improvements and payment of unexhausted manures in case of removal
 We would also respectfully suggest that it is essential to the wellbeing of a tenant that he would have as much land as would enable him to keep a horse otherwise he will often find himself compelled to do the work of that useful animal
The number of our stock was taken but betwixt obligations to our proprietor mealdealers shoemakers and merchants it will be soon exhausted
MARY MLEOD Widow STEWART RODERICK MDONALD JOHN GILLIES ANGUS ROSS JOHN CAMPBELL HUGH MACDONALD
No I have nothing unless I confirm what is already stated that the people require more land and that the ground is very much deteriorated in wet weather
I sell tea sugar and general groceries I am a general dealer only I have no soft goods at present
Yes I can
They are getting poorer every year
Their purchases of course are scattered
They deal only with me in smalls and they get their larger requirements from Portree Glasgow and other places
I am sure they do
They buy less
Less able but they are as willing if they were able to do it
Yes
Not just now
Exactly so
No I do not think it for some time back
Yes a good deal
Not of the production of this year or last year but from perhaps ten or twelve years ago
No there is no work at all unless they do it for themselves
There is no public work
That is one of the great evils the people complain of
Yes a great many especially to the fishing stations in Ireland the Isle of Man and on the east coast
Less money because the fishing has been a failure for years past
Not so many to the Long Island as to other places
Almost a failure
To the south
They used to go to the southto the railroads and other public works
Yes because the railroads are mostly finished compared with what they were in  and
They are fond of working at anything remunerative
A good many of them both male and female
No because the work is not so general there as it used to be in former times
I do not think so because the times are not what they were when the railways were busy
I wrought on the railway for s a week and I wrought on it for s a day
Yes but not at the same time
I cannot tell what wages they get at the road making if there is such in the south just now
They go to the same place generally to the fishing stations because it is what answers them best
They require to attend to their duties at home till they get the peats cut and then they are at home again at their harvest operations in time for looking after their corn crops
Well I am not aware that they do
Yes
I have sold on credit more than I should have done but I prefer ready money
Very little I only sell a little
I dont sell much
I sell on credit but not as a system
I sell on credit sometimes in spite of myself
Once I give it away it will be on credit then
In cases
I was taking a piece of land in connection with the little dealing I had and so I could not exactly form an estimate
Of course I made more bad debts when I gave out my goods  I do not give out so much now as I used to do
Well the people are strictly honest if they were able to meet their debts
Their ability is declining year after year
I will not make more bad debts because I am not so lavish in giving
I do not give so much as I used to do
It is very easy for me to know that
Yes that was in consequence of the failure of the potatoes to a great degree
What else could the poor people do unless they got a cup of tea when they had no potatoes
Not regularly
It cannot be regularly and I consider that those who have plenty of milk do not require tea so much
Yes but its quite a failure for this year and last year
There is not a cod this year where they used to be
It has ceased
There was not a cod to be dried this year
It used to be taken by different persons at different times
Of course they did not fish any this year
They could not get bait
They could not get herring
They require to get herring for bait
Yes
Yes
Yes but I have been some years in the south country
Yes that I do
A good deal to do with it
This shaking of the people is next door to evictions shaking the people and losing at every move
They are generally moved to worse places
I never heard of a removal to a better place nor had I one myself and I had several removals
I cannot give a concise account in acres but I know it has been inhabited by a good many people
He has two farms
Well there were sixteen lots on the farm of the Beinsoraig and a croft for the mill and a croft for the inn  but at the time of removing them in  there were only five or six families and there were not many people in some of them
One went to Glen Henisdale one to Idrigil and one is on the ground
Glen Conan or Glen Uig
Glen Conan is the new name
I cannot exactly say but I believe in connection with the farm there were more than fortythree families removed
The first removal was when Captain Fraser came to the place
Then when the hill pasture was added the rest were removed and brought to another place opposite
Of course Glen Uig has a southern exposure and the other is exposed to the blasts of the north wind
I do not recollect of any since
Well I think it should
It has so far as I know
I know that
I have no doubt a great many would avail themselves of the opportunity
Yes it would
They would avail themselves of it
Yes
Yes
On No
 Beinsoraig
I was there from  to  or
To No  of the same place
No
Seven years
After having put up two or three houses and two stackyards cornyards and several other improvements I lost the croft
When I was removed from No
 I was ordered to go to South Cuil aud I believed as the croft lies it would have been  and  chains  but as I would have to treat it it would have been  or  and after having taken the lot after my name was put on the lot when I got my cattle and sheep sold I did not go to the lot at all
A house at a distance of  or  chains more or less would not do at all with the house in one place and the cattle and the byre in another
In name of my barn I got  and at my first removal I got  but the barn byre and stable cost me 
Yes
Yes
Yes
Well I lost a good many of my customers at the time of these removals
When the house was pulled down people thought I would never rise again and my customers scattered and I am some distance from the road
Yes I believe that
Bad seasons heavy rents want of public works and failure of fishings at home and abroad
No but when people are down you will have to do more than put them on their feet
You will have to keep them up till they can do something for themselves
If people got Government money which other parts of the United Kingdom are getting in plentyif they got a little at  per cent and twenty years to pay itI have no doubt but that they would pay it honestly and that it would be laid out at good interest aud as sure as any speculation
In Ireland
To put the people into a better position
To enable them to get as much of the land as will keep them and then give them this money to stock and till it and build houses for themselves and their belongings
Plenty as much as would keep three times the number of its present inhabitants
Yes the land is nearly all taken up in three or four farmsthere is that farm which Urquhart has now
Mr MLeod
Yes it was first in the hands of the proprietor
Yes
No
It is eighteen years since I got the croft which I have at present
Yes
At a meeting of crofters in Shiader on th May Donald Campbell in the chair the following resolution was carried That our principal grievance consists in our rents having been raised three times during twentyseven years our original rents being  s to  s our present rent from  to  s
Originally we occupied more fertile crofts but these we were deprived of and were sent to other crofts less fertile than any on the estate
Our present crofts are in close proximity to a rapid cataract which is most dangerous and destructive when in flood often carrying away considerable portions of our crops
We have been incurring liabilities for a considerable time back
Should our creditors urge payment we would be left almost pennyless
Our original crofts were turned into a sheep farm beside us
There were fortytwo crofters of us in all in the place
We were all removedsome to Australia and some to America and to various other parts
When we were in our first crofts we were comfortable we feel  now quite the reverse
It was Major Fraser who removed us
And what we stand in great need of now is an addition to our hill pasture as it is quite evident that the spot pointed out to us in company with other four townships is quite inadequate to keep up the summing ordered by Captain Fraser
Our stock is starving in the hill and getting bad usage keeping them from tacks right and left without fence or dyke to keep them on our own ground but the truth is they are forced to trespass when they have hardly anything to eat on their own ground
We welcome the Commission and leave with confidence our truthful grievance in their handsTENANTS of Shiader Uig on the Kilmuir estate Skye
Eight
Yes
Our land is open to the north wind and it is the same way in ripening the harvest and then I cannot have seed upon it
We did not put a stone of meal into the mill this year in the Glen and we bought seed oats forby that
The people are complaining that the place is very dear and does not yield a crop being on a cold place and late in ripening
Yes
It is eighteen years since I came to Shiader and I was paying  s then and it was raised to 
In  the year of the flood
There was over s added to each lot betwixt the two
We got s in the pound of abatement
We were paying between  and  on the other side of the river at Tallautain
Once
 s
Twice
I think s was the first rise which was laid upon us in name of the doctors money
Yes
We are satisfied with that payment
No
Our rent was next raised to 
We had no reason other than the landlords will
We remonstrated with the factor and the factor told us we would have to leave our holdings if we would not pay
We were not asked by them to improve our holdings but we were improving them voluntarily and we then got a little assistance from the landlord
The ground officer was sent round to look after the work and what the officer thought proper we got
Drains
Ever since we came to our present holdings
Yes they improved the ground
It was quagmire when we came to it
Yes it still exists
No and it is not worth  s even with the improvements
It is as good value now at  as it was before at  s when we entered  but the croft never was worth  s
No when we were shifted to Shiader we got hill pasture along with the crofts
No the land that we formerly had had a sunny exposure and what we now have has not
We have seven weeks of the year that the sun does not shine at all upon us
Five shillings in the pound
About  exclusive of assessments
That is the case
Only that the rent ever was too high
Drainage
About  rods
No nor half wages
I drained my present holding at intervals of five yards three feet deep otherwise it would not be dry

Yes
Yes
No he gave us no material
Yes that is all I got
There were some of them who did the work but who did not get any remuneration for the ground officer did not go to see their work
I do not know but they themselves are saying they got nothing for their work
Yes
Between Tallantain and North Coil which is included in the Glen
Very very much against our own will and many of us weeping at leaving our former places
Mr Urquhart has it now but the landlord himself had it at first
It was unoccupied
Yes every stone to quarry out without any assistance but we got   of assistance
We had the choice of going to a township here and there if we did not want to go to Shiader
We were asked to make an offer of rent
Our predecessor was paying  for the land before we entered it and we offered  for it and our offer was rejected
We then offered  The   was agreed to by the landlord but when we got our lands we found we had to pay 
Our predecessor was paying  for the land before we entered it and we offered  for it and our offer was rejected
We then offered  The   was agreed to by the landlord but when we got our lands we found we had to pay 
Yes
Yes
We entered our lands at Whitsunday and at Martinmas we paid the full rent
Yes only that we had the halfyears grass out of it
 was all the compensation  and when two crofters occupied one lot they each got s of compensation instead of  
The   was divided
Yes
I do not remember just now we had great trouble forbye the expenditure on mason work
I paid the masons and carried the stones a good piece to the ground
I had the roof of the house I had before and some more added to it
No
It would and I was working day and night
We had to move out the very day and we were staying in broken houses till we got out
My present summing is four cows and a horse and about thirty sheep
I have only a quarter of a lot
That arose on account of a marriage in the family
My relations were in the lot before I went into it
No
I am sure of it
No
Yes
Yes
At a meeting of crofters at Idrigill on th May William Campbell in the chairthe following resolution was agreed to That it is absolutely necessary that additional land should be given to each crofter in order to enable him to live as our present holdings are utterly inadequate to support us for two months in a favourable year
Our existence depends on the immediate enlargement of our crofts
We also feel it to be a great grievance that we are prevented by the smallness of our crofts from keeping a horse to help us with the tillage as it is laborious and even degrading for our women and men to have to carry all manure and seaware on their backs
The want of hill grazing is very much felt by us in various ways
First the want of hill grazing prevents us from keeping some sheep
The result of that prevention is that many of us have no better bed clothes than old bags formerly used in conveying whelks to Glasgow
We also desire to bring under the notice of the Commission that we are under the necessity of keeping a herd to keep away the sheep of neighbouring tacks which often do damage to our little crops
We dare not complain for fear of eviction
The seaware on our foreshores is not sufficient for the manuring our several crofts
We often have to go to the outlying tenantless islands to cut seaware
The proprietor Captain MDonald Waternish prohibits us from doing so
We arethirtyseven families in Idrigill
For many years back we often have to go to the banks for our rents and to other money lenders so that our present debts are nearly  Our credit with but few exceptions is gone
We welcome the Commission and these our truthful grievances we leave with confidence in their hands
Not much further than what is expressed in the paper
We want more land to pay a rent
The land we have is too small
We cannot support our families on it
We have just about two and a half acres each
We have a cow and a stirk but no sheep and no horse
Our rent is  and a few pence
Inclusive of rates
It used to be   until the last reduction
Two or three of us are paying s d more than that
Some of us are in arrear
Some of them had to use the money in buying food
The summing is one cow one stirk no sheep no horse
No
Yes there is a place out at the back for the cows
About two and a half acres
We go to Waternish to get seaware but the proprietor forbids us
 s d
Then by act of Government we made drains and Is d was laid upon our crofts for drainage interest
It was Is d on the whole sum that was expended on the drains
The rents were raised three times
It was in three successive rises raised to   and it was reduced to what we now pay two years ago
I cannot remember each step of the rise
The first rise took effect nearly twenty years ago
Then the doctors money was laid upon us and was included in the rent
We pay the doctors money along with the rent
Yes
This last reduction that took effect two years ago is not promised to continue
We are still charged the old rent and the reduction is credited to the amount
The reduction is not permanent
We do not know
We do not expect the actual reduction made during the past two years will be asked from us again
We want more land at a fair rent sufficient to support our families
On credit and now those who have been supplying us with credit cannot supply it any further
Their own credit is gone
When we are able we go to work for wages but I am now getting too old for that
Half the year
I would need to be working about the land
Both as opportunity offered
I had once a boat of my own but I have not now
Yes
Wages alter
 or 
Yes
Not every year
The year we would have a stirk to seU we sold it and the year we had not we just went deeper into debt
If potatoes were growing as they used to grow they would keep us four or five months  but the potatoes do not grow with us nowthe land has got exhausted
Potatoes have been getting gradually worse for some time back here
Yes
For a time that did good
They have got deteriorated since then
Yes but the year we have not potatoes good it would not keep us alive for that length of time
I have one daughter able to help me with her wages but she cannot get away to earn wages
No our family has a lot as it was in our earliest recollection
A little hill of ground was taken away for planting wood
Yes all that our shores afford  but we have not enough
The payment of the seaware is included in our rent
In Cuiderach
Some were taking full payment for it from us and others were giving it gratis
The fishing is gone but there are some who would fish if there was any to be caught
Two or three have big boats going away to Ireland and elsewhere
No
Yes
Part of it was left but was threshed out by the wind
Yes
We got no assistance from relief committees
We got a bushel of seed oats from Mr Lamont
Yes
All the crofters got one bushel
We bought seed oats and seed for potatoes from the captain
It is not told us yet
We have heard the potatoes would be s a barrel on us
I do not think I have
Yes
That the rent is so heavy that we cannot live on the land and we have to go everywhere to earn money to support us
I have here a receipt for the rent I was paying in  and a receipt for the rent just now
The same lands
A full years rent
In  it was  s d  and in  the rent was  poor rate s d school rate s roads s interest s d in all  s
Yes I got a reduction of  last year
The  includes rates and taxes
I cannot say but that is the amount of the rent with the rates
No not at that time
I paid no rates and taxes in addition to the  s d
We cannot live paying our present rent with two cows
If I had five followers from them this year I would have none next year the place is so bad There is no feeding for them
I have only two of a family now and it is more than a year since my family or I ate any produce of our soilbuying everything from the merchant even seed
We got seed this year from the landlord
We got  bushels of seed oats this year and a barrel of potatoes from the landlord and we will have to pay it back
We wish to have as much of the land as would keep us alive and would enable us to pay the landlord instead of going from country to country as slaves
There is plenty land in the Isle of Skye if we could only get it which would support double the population
We have only got the remnants of the land which the tacksmen haveremnants which the tacksmen would not take
The laud is very bad and very thinvery shallow
My holding is very poor indeed when I cannot support three of us out of it
As to the rent we have not the promise that the reduction shall continue
Any place where I would get it
Is there not land all about usbig tacks
The nearest tack is Cuiderach next to Kingsburgh
No
I have two cows and two twoyearolds and a stirk and none of them belong to myself
From the charitable gentlemen outside of the island of Skyeand perhaps they may be present here todaywho are sending money to help Skye people and perhaps we might be able to get money till the place would enable us to repay it
There are people among us who are as willing to repay any such advances and their honest debts as can be
I do not know but I know that we have such a complaint among ourselves
No wages unless it be s d a day between that and s
I do not know
I do not think they are getting much
There are very few men working on the roads
I have been going to Kintyre for the past ten years remaining there at work until winter time while the work is to be done and when my spring work is over I expect to leave the country again this year
 going and  returning and the gentleman was giving my companions and myself s each to meet the  expense
s d a day and lodging but we have to feed ourselves
Twenty lots and two of the lots have two families each
The summing of the croft is three cows ten sheep and a horse but I have only seven sheep
I have a horse
Three times
Yes
I believe we have been paying rent more than a hundred years
I do not know that there was any rise in the rent previous to the time of the present proprietor
The same rent for which I have produced a receipt
Yes
It may be continued but no promise has been made
That the landlord saw the rent was too high I suppose
Partly owing to the badness of the times
Twentythe same number but in times past it was four and then the ground was cut into lots
My father got one of these original lots and I succeeded him in the lot
He was not one of the four he was one of the twenty who got the subdivision of the four
They were taken from other places
At Keistle
The same marches
Yes
A piece of the hill pasture was taken from us but it was added to another township which was as needy as we were where there were crofters
No
I was not born when that was done
No
Nobut there are poor among us who have not got land at all
A good number
There are seven
They were not all born in Earlish
It was with the proprietors leave that some of them came from Uig
The township is not at all the better of it
Though we are paying poor rates those poor people are coming about the houses the same as before
Those of the tenants who had wet land were draining it and we are taking the sand from the knolls and spreading it where the soil is shallower
My son and myself were working the whole of last winter at that work and doing a little of it every year
No we cannot get it
There is not limestone on the place
In Lord Macdonalds time there were several lots that were cheaper than mine
They were all raised the same as mine was in Captain Frasers time
Yes
At a meeting of crofters in Glen Hinisdale on  May Malcolm MLeod crofter in the chaira resolution was passed and carried
The principal cause of our grievance is the repeated rising of our rent
When Major Fraser got the estate our rents were from  s to s and he raised it to  and s with the exception of two crofts whose rents were when he became proprietor  and he raised them to  s and  also an assessment of s d per  rendering our condition such that should our rents be reduced to the sum it was when Major Fraser became proprietor it would take a considerable time before we could clear ourselves from our just debts
Of fifteen  crofters our liabilities amount to over  sterling and with but few exceptions our credit is gone also our stock is unsaleable at this time owing to their impoverished condition
Our grazing will not carry more than half the stock assigned to it the deathrate is excessive both summer and winter  some of us at times lose perhaps the half of his small number
Concerning the cultivating land the soil is so poor that on an average for six years back if any of us makes a boll or two of meal from his own oats he must buy sowing seed
Our houses are scarcely habitable which we cannot repair owing to our being so poor and for want of lime and wood
We also suffer great inconvenience from the want of our roads which were destroyed by the great flood of  and never was repaired although we  pay for roads and have done so for a considerable time
We pray that the Royal Commission will give us the land in a way that we can live on and in such a way that the proprietor cannot raise our rent or remove us although we would improve our lands
Signed MALCOLM MLEOD
Yes
He is here today
The people of Glen Hinisdale
Yes
No
A good part of their wishes
Yes
Every man of them
Yes
Yes
Our holdings are too small even if they were of their value
Fifteen
Fifteen
No
Not since the captain came
Yes the hill
A great piece
It may be sixty years ago
It was added to the Kingsburgh tack
Four cows and fifty sheep and a horse
Each of us have not got that or the half but that is the summing
The place will not keep half that number
I have six cow and seven young beasts
I buy grass every year
Yes two horses
Yes about fifty old sheep and twenty hoggs
 s
Yes mine is a double lot
Yes the other tenants have a little more than the half that I have
Yes
Two cows two young beasts and about twenty or thirty sheep
Yes
They have a horse also
I get the grazing of a cow for s d in any part of the estate that is to say not in any part but in most of it
From the crofters
You will not get it from the large farmers
Yes
For half the year from Whitsunday
The small tenants many of them have not got cows
They have become so poor and they are glad to let their grazing in this way
Because they have not got the stock on it
They have become so poor they have not got cattle and they make use of it in this way
From those who have got no cattle themselves
Yes
Two stacks sometimes or one stack of corn
According to the year  or 
For one stack and sometimes 
Yes often
Yes some of them are improvable  the land is bad but some of it is improvable
Yes no doubt of that
Yes
I cannot say that but it was when we had improved our crofts that the rent was raised
Yes
Three times I think
Shortly after the captain got the property
Yes some of them
Most of them were improved a little
Drains and trenches
Yes
Not altogether
I do not think so with regard to Glen Henisdale but it was the case in Glen Uig where I first was
No
There are five new tenants
They became so poor that they preferred leaving the place
Some to Portree some to Glasgow some to Australia
Yes those who are in Australia are doing well
I do not know but I believe there are
Both to the landlord and the mealdealer and the bank
I cannot say not the third part of that
I was not in debt at all five years ago
Yes
Yes
Yes some of them
Yes
Yes
Some Is or s in the pound
They say so
I cannot say particularly about that
Yes till about a year or two ago
Yes
He was going to give us two years rent back and to take our effects at a valuation
Some of them were thinking of going to America and to Australia and others could not emigrate at all
There were those who could not pay the cart to take their effects to Portree
Yes
I believe so
I do not know
Some of them drew back
We believed that those who drew back had been bribed to do sobought to do so
I do not know
Yes they agreed to go if all would go
Yes
The landlord drew back from his promise
Yes
I do not know about half of them
I have only suspicion
No
Yes
Yes
We have no schoolmaster just now
From last winter we have not had a schoolmaster
I do uot know
Yes
I do not know but it is the Rev
Mr Lamont
Mr Macdonald Portree factor
No none of them visited us
They hold their meetings at Kensaleyre
Yes
At Uig
I do not know
There is no occasion for him to visit us when there is no schoolmaster
I should think there are twentyfive  perhaps there are more than that
They have been getting no teaching for the last half year
Yes I heard the most part of it
It would be little enough
Ten acres of ground will not on any part of this estate keep six cows
It would not keep three cows with us
Yes
It would not support a family for a month without live stock
Our township is the worst land on the estate
About three wedders each tenant on an average
That was the case last year
Our whole township only sold four cattle last year
We are only two of us and the two of us sold of the increase of our stock three stirks and one twoyearold
About  or 
Some years the yield might be worse than that some years might be better
Yes
Not more than  acres
No it would not keep my family in comfort
We would need double that
We can only leave out very little of it and it would require very much manure to put it in heart to yield any crop
It would go back to heather in three years
No
We put guano on potatoes and turnips
We have no seaware
It is too far away from us
We use a little
No
Yes
Yes
Sheep
Yes
I cannot say what would be a reasonable rent for the ugly place
If you ask me what would be a reasonable rent in the place which I had before it was   when Captain Fraser became proprietor
Yes that was in Glen Uig
Seven cows big and little
Between  and  acres
Up to fifty a piece
I was thinking that the landlord could keep them to the agreement when every one of them had signed it
I thought it was from the landlord it came
That the place was dear and I do not think anybody else would give the rent for itthat he would not not get the same rent for it
I did not think that anybody else had influence
No
The innkeeper Mr Urquhart
I was much the worse of it
Yes
A crofter who left the place and went to Glasgow
It was getting poorer he was
He does not belong to this island
He came with the captain  I do not know from where
It was not Mr Urquhart who had the place then
The landlord himself had the land first which Mr Urquhart has now
Twenty families were in the upper part and more and cottars besides  and twentythree families from the lower ground
It was in Captain Frasers time
I know that they are not the better of their removal
It is far from the sea
We are two miles from the country road
There is a cart track but the floods spoiled it and carried away a sort of bridge that was on it
Yes
We were not seeing the landlord at all
It was the factor who was raising the rent upon us
Yes
Mr Alexander MDonald
Yes
We got a little help from the landlord
He sent the ground officer to value the work when he raised the rents last
I got 
I have seen the landlord once or twice in our place
About s in the pound
No
They say so
Yes
I heard that some were getting s in the pound and others s
Any one who may have money in the bank and whom the bank will accept
No I have not known a case of that kind
Yes
I know that they would be willing
I should think it would be easier for them to pay that than as they are
No
Yes
I am sure they would if they had the place in such a way that it would pay them
No
No
Yes
Yes to the best of my judgment
Want of sufficient land to support their families and that at a reasonable rent as the place would afford We are wanting that we should be treated as we hear other parts of the country are treatedthat we would not be removed from our holdings
These are the desires and the grievances and I have not much more to say
More land out of which we could support ourselves
Two acres and a half I believe
Six stones of meal is all I have been able to make during the last sixteen years
Yes we thresh all the com unless we give a sheaf to the beasts
Yes and more
No it would not be worth while
I would not have half a boll of oats altogether
I give it to the stock after threshing it
I must needs do that
Yes
Yes I sow seven bushels of seed oats
About four or four and a half barrels
My land cannot plant more
Not altogether
Some of it cannot be cropped
In the sort of grass in which it ever was
The cattle eat it
A cow and a twoyearold I am entitled to keep and I cannot winter the cow on the croft
About  worth of feeding besides the crop of the ground
A few
About twelve
I have a horse
I am the only one in the place who has a horse
The keep of the horse is exclusive of what I have mentioned
I spent about  more for the keep of the horse besides the  That would not feed him but he gets food when out at work with others
That was what I had in view in keeping it but the principal profit which it is to me is that it does my work
Yes that is the case
I use the horse to take home my fuel
Three miles
Yes
Yes
 s d but I got a reduction about four years ago
We got s in the pound
About  s
I do not mean in the country in which I am  I refer to Ireland
I do not want a lease at all I wish that we would have the land to ourselves
I cannot say until I would see the amount of land we would get
I would require as much as would keep up a family
Unless I would get it on the land where I am
There is plenty of land
I do not see anyland in possession of the crofters which is not too small for them already
I would take the land which we require from those who have got too much of it
I cannot say much about that but I believe it would be heavy on them to pay it
I have been five years in the spot in which I am now
In a spot near it
To give my land to another
The innkeeper here
The rent was raised twice on me I was removed twice
From North Cuil first
Because the landlord was wanting that land for himself
 s
A cow and a calf
 s at first
It was not that the rent was raised but I was put out of the land
Yes
I am not aware there was any
Seven cows a horse and I do not remember how many sheep
I could keep about thirty sheep
I was middling comfortable on it
No
Only what I earn with the help of the horse unless I buy and sell a beast
Some
Field labour
No not every day
I cannot say from personal experience
Yes
Yes the last time I was removed
Five or six years ago
Five I think
Two of them are still in Bensoraig one in Glen Ilinisdale and another in Idrigill
There were no removals since then but at that time five were removed from the other side of the loch
I do not know of anything but the will of the landlord
Donald Ross has got their land now
Mr Urquhart the innkeeper
No it was not good crofts before there was not a good croft in it
Not about here
Yes
Yes
Yes
A brother of mine signed it once
There was at any rate at one time
I was signing plenty of them myself
When I was in the other place but it is not my having been removed that has left me so unable to do what I could do before
Mr Urquhart has now got the land from which I was first removed under a tack
The man who occupied it before me is not living
Yes
Yes falling off and that not little
Possibly there may have been one who was bettered but I do not remember an instance but it was worse for every one of them
The population is increasing I believe but many have to leave the country because of the smallness of the holdings
Yes I am acquainted with the fishing in this bay but there is no fishing now
The fish are not there
I believe there are three years that they have got no fishings
They have spoiled their tackle in their endeavours to fish during that time
Using the tackle and no fish in it
No herring is to be found here
I have seen fishing here before and there may be fishing yet and the quay would certainly not be in the  way here
A quay would be of good service to us for we could get our supplies landed without loss or damage as it is from the south country we are getting our supplies
Yes
I cannot say they would go out in all weathers but they would go out in any likely weather
Oh yes  they are doing so now they use their endeavours now in very unlikely weather
Yes the shelter would be on the other side on the north side in such weather
Not at the time
A good part of it was of use to me
The rent is too high
Should I have the croft for nothing it would not be of use to me
Yes
When I left the first place I got  as the value of the house I left
The wall of that house cost me  to build
At the next place from which I was removed I quarried all the stones for the house which I built and I got no compensation for it
The house in which I am just now I found builtthe wall of it at least
I myself put the roof on it and I am asked to pay s of rent for the bare walls and I got nothing for the walls that I left behind
To the factor
I brought the roof from the last house
Eight
One pays less than I do and the rest pay more
Yes not far off if we could only get access to it
There is a beautiful glen out thereGlen Uig
Mr Urquhart
Yes
Yes
Fifteen or sixteen years ago
There were no strange crofters taken in
No doubt of that
They would be willing enough to do that but I do not know they would be quite able to do it without help
Not without help to stock the ground and if they could but once get the crop out and take food out of it I believe they would be able to pay on ever after that
I think it should be prohibited
I believe that such a subdivision has caused a good deal of loss already
Yes I would approve of that
A  croft would be better and such a croft would be likely to do and the people of this place are not likely to ask more for such a croft at such a rent would support their families comfortably
I only work with the horse
In some places s a day and I feed myself
I never worked for him but one day
No I may work for the poor people who have no horses themselves
I would rather have the land
I would need the piece of land to euable me to feed the horse
I would prefer the piece of land
That is according to the place where I would see the croft
A croft of  or  acres and I would keep six cows on that
In my experience in former days such a croft would be had at 
I do not say that would not be accounted a small rent nowadays
There was not much days work going on in those days
I have nothing more to say further than I have said alreadythat I know of no likely remedy to improve the condition of the people but to give them sufficient land to keep their families in comfort and if they do not get that they will be very much worse than they are
I myself whatever way I may be able to procure it have to spend  a year on meal from Glasgow
I am situated at Eyre six years Whitsunday coming
We are complaining of narrow bounds
We have a small stock of sheep in common
On behalf of othersfor the whole township
Yes
Neil MLeod is not at home and I have been put in his place
W e are complaining of the narrow bounds of hill pasture we have
Our pasture is only half a mile broad from the bounds of the tack on the one side to the boundary of the township on the other side of us
This entails upon us a great deal of herding at these boundaries
We cannot let a beast pass beyond the boundaries
We are in danger of having them poinded
We are in danger of losing our place
Kingsburgh is on the one side of us  Scorrybreck on the other
We are complaining again of the arable landit is so bad
It is shallow land
We are keeping a few cows and a horse and a few sheep and we are losing the lambs for want of a wintering place  and the food that we ought to be using ourselves we are obliged to expend on our stock in winter to keep them alive
These are our particular hardships
The soil does not yield crop to us and we have no ground that we can leave out in rotation
Our ground has been cropped for the past hundred years and we have no ground to afford rotation
No the hill is as it was but part of our arable laud was taken from us and given to others
To other crofters
Part of our ground was taken from us and two families were settled upon it by the late factor Tormorethree families in factand no corresponding decrease was made on our rents on the contrary our rents were raised
Two women came from Sleat and another woman belonged to the township and a smith who had been for some time in the township also
They were shifted out of the way because there was something about one of these women who came from Sleat that made it convenient to remove her
There are nine
I pay  s
Three cows two stirks two twoyear olds and about twenty sheep and one horse
The summing is four cows and no stirks
Six years
I was previously in Bracadale but then the factor sent us to the lower part of Duirinish
My father and grandfather were in Ebost as cottars paying  of rent
Kenneth MLeod
Mr Gibbons the tenant when he came took a tack and removed the tenants
To Lowergill a part of MLeod of MLeods estate now part of the lands of MPhersons trustees
I was five years in Lowergill
Then the new factor came Hugh MAskill of Tallisker
We were only five years under him as factor
Bad times and bad prices came on us and the plan he took with us was that he made a market for us himself and he and his officer would come and gather our cattle together promising he would get much better prices for them than the tenants could get
He carried this on for two years
Before the two years were out the ten tenants of us were paying ten guineas each and in two years the tenants had got so much into debt that they were unable to keep their holdings and the factor took the lands himself and five of the crofters went to Australia
Five remained and I am one of those five
We then got a bit of the township that was laid out to us at  of rent
We were there until another factor came
 Five years
We were thirtythree years between the two places
It was  for this bit of ground seven of us were located upon it
Some were getting into debt running out of their means and as they ran out we were taking their land
At last there were only five of us we were paying the rent
There was not a penny of arrears on us
Then Tormore became factor
The factor got some vacant township lands that were adjoining ours on the estate of Orbost and when Tormore came he never rested and nothing would do until he became possessed of our lands
He removed the five families of us and I believe that they did not owe a sixpence of arrears among them
We were not wanting to go
I offered him when he was saying the rent was too heavy for us and the place too big for us that I would be one of two to take it and my saying so was the cause of my being removed to Eyre
There was a vacant lot at Eyre and he himself was then factor for both estates for Lord Macdonalds estate as welland I was promised I would get everything I would need if I would only take his advice
I need not tell how affairs turned out but I left Lowergill and went to Eyre where I am now
One of these Lowergill tenants is in Pabbay one at Broadford two are in Glendale and the one that is in Pabbay when removed from Lowergill was sent to Ramasaig which is a township alongside Lowergill and from Ramasaig he was shifted to Pabbay
Tormore cleared the crofters off the two townships of Ramasaig and Lowergill
There were twentyone crofters in Ramasaig aud five of us in Lowergill
I was in Eyre at the time the Ramasaig people were removed
They were removed two years after we were
I am a good deal worse off than I was in Lowergill
I am considerably more in debt no w in fact I was free of debt when I left Lowergill
That is the difference and it is a great difference
The year I came to Eyre turned out to be a bad year
I got largely into debt before I managed to pull myself aud family through
I have one thing to say if it could be done for usif we will get land near its value
I believe I am paying double rent for the land which I have and I would ask if we got that good land which we might improve that neither landlord nor factor would have the power to remove us
No
They would put us away at the end of it
I built new houses wherever I went and I had to leave them all without getting compensation and I know too much of factors work now
If it could be doneand we are hearing it is being done in other placeswe wish that we could buy the bit of land we occupy and that Government would help us to buy it
If the latter cannot be done and in the event of our getting land at a fair rent we would need to be assured against eviction when we improved it
Yes I believe more than half of them would
How many times over does the amouut that my father aud my grandfather and I have paid of rent amount to it
I am not a fisherman
There are three of us and we liveon a piece of ground that was appointed for us in a corner of the tack of Skerrinishan outoftheway and rocky placea wet mossy place
It would not make two acres of proper ground
I have one cow
I plant both potatoes and corn on the bit of ground I have
No
To the tacksman of Skerrinish
 and that in work
One hundred days for a male and two hundred for women
My own daughter and she gets only d a day
One shilling a day for myself
I got no food with that
The place will not support myself and my family
When I was strong and was leaving the country to work I would get sometimes s a day
s a day
Not less than Is
Yes
The same pays a day
No he would not take the money
I built the house myself
With my own hands
About 
I spent  upon it besides my work
It took time as I had to carry the stones
I had to bring the stones some of them  or  yards
No
Forty years ago
The house would belong to my representatives
Yes I have three sons and three daughters
If a person came in my place he would take it at a valuation
Perhaps not more than 
 I have to make this complaint that in winter time we only get d per day and women get d
Yes
Yes ten hours
No I do not know a tack in Skye or elsewhere where so little pay is given
Yes we had additional privileges from the predecessor of the present tacksmanMr William Macdonald
We could keep a few sheep
When the present tacksmans predecessor came I had to part with the sheep but he allowed me to keep two sheep
At the first term he charged me s a head for the grazing of them and he sold the lambs for me an
at last he took away the sheep altogether from me
To get a bit of land at a fair rent
I never had a croft but my predecessors had a croft
At Borve
Yes
He came to Skerrinish
It was the farm of Skerrinish that had added to it the townships from which the crofters were cleared
Only a bit the same as I have
Only my own labour
No
I am strong enough to do a little work about the place
No
Yes they could  they are helping me a little now
One of the daughters is with me and another is married
I have a son and a daughter married and they have enough to do for themselves
About three months
To buy everything else all the year roundfood and clothing for myself and family
Yes on the same footing
Fortytwo years
Fortytwo years since my father was cleared off the township of Borve
There were no money wages at the time we went but we had as much ground as we liked and grazing and food twice a day in order to be at the tacksmans disposal to work for him when he wanted us at any time
Yes
Twenty years ago
When the s was allowed us and the rent imposed we had a good bit of ground and we were taking food out of it
That was taken from us and we were then put into a bad cornera corner tack contiguous to the township lands
One thing we want is to get a little bit of land and to pay for it to the landlord
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
I believe it is owing to the oyster beds being there that we are not allowed to gather mussels or bait
The shore belongs to another proprietor
He had forbid it to every one
No they would not The oyster beds are not so high up on the shore as the mussels
Yes we are sure it does
We cannot go to fish for want of bait for our lines
The same
They have not come in here to complain yet but likely they will
Yes the same
No
I have nothing particular to add to MNabs evidence at that point
I cannot explain much about it
I was not in the company
The man said that they were cutting peats for six years and got nothing for itneither food nor wages but the imposition of that work ceased last year
In the present proprietors predecessors time they had to give several days work and the present proprietor remitted the labour and exacted an equivalent iu money from them and added it to the rent
For his own house
I am not sure
Six years ago
It was just the proprietors will
I was cutting peats myself one year
Two days
Each family had to cut an iron and to cut that would take two days work of two and that was imposed upon each crofterevery one that was paying rent
Yes
We dont know that
No but as the preceding delegates wantedextended holdings
We have neither horses nor sheep and the hill pasture was taken from us
I was not paying rent when the hill pasture was taken from us but I am paying now
 a yeir and others pay 
Two cows some years I may have a stirk and some years two
Two cows and two stirks
No
About two and a half or three acres of thin poor hard soil
Sometimes a double return and sometimes half a returnsometimes double what we put in and sometimes only half as much
Half as much again as the seed put in
Sometimes two barrels out of a barrel and sometimes five
Yes but we have to buy the seaware
From other lairds
There is not much seaware on our landlords ground at all
Perhaps if it was a good growing year
Our township has a right to a bit of shore but besides that we buy seaware from our landlord
Yes
I do not think there is
I heard and understood all that the preceding delegate said
I agree with what he said
I saw my neighbour letting out two stirks in the morning and these stirks were taken home dead at night owing to the badness of grazing
In summer
It is below our crofts in the big moss
Is it not very hard now to be paying heavy rent in such a place as that
Yes
Yea
I have seen the same man getting a beast out on another occasion and bringing it home dead from the same place
They were smothered in the moss
No
No
We are so much confined in the place we are so bounded that we have no elbow room on any side and I may say there are four tacks about us
We are surrounded by four tacks and shut in by them so that we have no escape on either side as if we were shut up iu a fold
We want a slice of hill pasturage that we may have a sheep stock
I have been nearly forty years in the place and I have not fleeced a sheep and sometimes I am reduced to twine a thread to darn my stockings for want of wool
It would be very unfair if we do not get a piece of hill pasture
Yes
I am that age upon it and my father before me
 is my rent exclusive of rates
Four cows without followers and a horse
I think about  acres much of it useless for crops

A short time since it was raised by Tormore s in the pound
Their one particular complaint is that they are in a confined township without sea or hill pasture and we had hill pasture before now
Six crofts and six families occupy the six crofts
Not many
Two cottars but they dont pay anything to us at any rate
We particularly want hill pasture we cannot live without it
The factor took it from us and added it to another township
It was added to the farm which is now occupied by Mr Mackay the home farm of Portree
A long time since I believe fifty years ago
A little reduction was made at that time in our rent
We made some work on our lots  we got some rent remitted to us on account of that
We are paying the interest of that money till now though it should have been paid out in sixteen years
But the pasture connected with our township is so bad that it is not worth walking over
Our families cannot exist in our townships for want of sheep stockbuying everything that the family needs and having no sheep and the only thing we want is the hill pasture
Yes
Yes every crofter in our township could do that
We did not ask our present factor
We never asked hill pastureI did not at any rate but we intended
We do not complain anything particularly of that if we would only get the hill pasture
We want the late increase in our rents to be taken off about s in the  
Our crops are much worse than they used to be
It is not much use over and above feeding our stock
It will not altogether feed our stock
We have to provender for them otherwise
 to  worth of corn
Just as happens to be most obtainable
Nothing more
I am not a fisherman
For thirtythree years
Yes
I was born at Henisdale
When I was young I have seen seventeen crofters there in that Glen and three of them had dauble shares
There was no school in the Glen at all
They were able to send their families to other places to give them education
Well any of the rest here in the Glen could not do that because they had single crofts and half crofts
But I think those who had a double proportion were able to send their families to give them education
I was removed from the place to another glento Keistle yphere
I have seen that those who have double crofts are better off than those who have single crofts and half crofts
They are more able to pay their rents than those who have single or halfcrofts and I think that would give peace to themselves and their proprietors when they would have double shares
And I think moreover if people would have double shares they would be more able to pay their rents than with single shares
It would be a bad year when their crufts would not be worth anything  they would have their stock to pay the proprietors  and as some of the other men were saying if they had more land at a reasonable rent the poor people would be far better off
When they could not raise crop they would have stock
When I came into the croft the first rent I paid was  s d
Corrie was alive at the time and he was the factor then  and I continued in that state for twenty years paying to Corrie  and my neighbours and myself were in use to go with their rent to Corrie
Well Corrie died and the proprietor who was factor to old Lord Macdonald Tormore came in and the rent was raised and the second year after Tormore came in my lot was  That was  s d of rise
There were fourteen tenants who had fourteen shares and there was another man Peter Macdonald in Portree who had two shares
There were sixteen tenants in the place then and when thatman died the low land he had was joined into Skerriuish farm and we had the hill that he had and he laid s apiece on the fourteen shares and my lot was  s and the rest was greater
It is a kind of a narrow strip we have of the hill and we are surrounded with tacksmen on each side and they are giving us very bad justice
The man who was at the marchWilliam MLeod in Scorrybreckwas very hard upon us and we are obliged to pay more than   for poinding our sheep in one year on the fourteen tenants
Yes we had a herd for the sheep and we had another herd for the horses and another herd for the stirks  when this low land was joined into Skerriuish he raised s on the fourteen shares for his hill and that piece was put in the Skerrinish farm
I cannot tell you
It was not fair at all to take it from us
No I was not at home at the time
We stood out upon the factor Mr Macdonald of Portreethat we would not pay the old rent because the land was taken from us but it was Tormore who took it from us and any alteration this factor made upon us was on our side
He took   of the rent down of this last rent we paid
We cannot blame him for that
He took   off the whole fourteen shares
Any alteration he made was on our side
That is my opinion
You cannot double them unless you would go into other places
No to give more land at other places
Fourteen
You could not get it in that place
No you could not double the old crofts
Well it is my opinion they could get land beside themfarms occupied by other people
There are plenty of tacks about them
Yes
Yes if the people would get it in other places
If the tenants would have double shares they would be better off
That is what I mean
No a single share
Glenhaultin and Skerrinish
Arable land
I cannot say it
No I have never had a lease
Yes we got a writ from him that he was going to raise the rent
We had to pay the rent
No
No
We didnt say a word against it
 but I did not pay it altogether
Three cows and three stirks and a horse
About  head of sheep
Yes that is what I think
No a reasonable rent
The thing that I have seen was that those who had two crofts when I was young were paying  for the two crofts
Yes I would think that a fair rent
Very near the same size
Not very much
Because he would have advantage over us  they would be running to him
Yes
A few but never many of them
Because we were afraid for the bigger men
Yes
In one year for poinding the sheep
No the man who is there today never took a penny from us nor Skerrinish nor Kingsburgh
Yes
Yes he had more arable land than we had
It was a kind of pasture he had on the low ground there was none of the arable land at all
Yes for the whole he had left
It was too much for us
We spoke to the factor and he took half of it off
The factor thought it too much
Yes it would be very useful to us
It was given unknown to us and nothing said about it
No there is water between that and Skerrinish
Yes
Yes
It was the shepherd in Scorrybreck farm
Yes there would be a little complaint between us and the shepherd no doubt
No
Yes we have a certain number
No back and forward between fourteen shares
No
I think they would
Yes at the place where I was brought up those who had a double share Mere better off than those who had a single share
Yes more land at a reasonable rent to help the poor people
On Lord Macdonalds estate  I was never out of the island
I have not had a croft long but it is thirteen years since my father got it
He is not alive
I have not been a fisherman
We are too far from the sea
Part of it
Yes
What I have to say is that I do not think should Lord Macdonald give them the whole land they have from him free gratis it would not free them from their present state of poverty
I speak of the people of the district in which I reside
I mean the district comprising the seventeen families among whom I live and the cause of that is this that the years have come to be so poor and they have run out of their effects through having to buy food for themselves and their families and their stock
I believe that the people are seven times worse than if they had nothing are emptyif every thing were put in its place
If the people paid their debts they would be seven times worse than nothing
The people have come to be so poor that they are not able to work the land as it ought to be worked and again they have so little of the land
We dont blame the landlord for their poverty but there are no works going on in the place
They must needs go elsewhere to work and they cannot attend to their crofts and when they go elsewhere and are not able to attend properly to their crofts they have to buy food for themselves and their stock elsewhere and though they are trying to keep stock not a head of the stock belongs to themselves but to their creditors and to the landlord
When that is so the people cannot but be poor
They are occupying land which has not been manured for twentyfive years though they must needs cultivate this land for the very poor return of the little corn and weeds that it yields
They pay equal to their rent in money for the wintering of their stock besides what the land yields
When Mr Martin came to be our tacksman we were paying the multures  we were paying the equivalent in money along with our rent so much on each croft and when we became tenants of Lord Macdonald Tormore was the factor and that payment continued and it is included in the rent stillthese old multuresand should any of us have to use the mill for grinding our meal we have to pay multure all the same so that we have to pay double
At Tote
So much on each boll
The miller is here present and will speak for that
I have taken corn to the mill but I could not tell the quantity the miller took out
I do not know the capacity of his measure
We have not more than half a boll with the sort of oats that we have
The worst kind of our oats would not yield more than three stones to the boll
In a good year and with oats from a strong ground a boll of oats might possibly yield seven stones on the average
Yes
We have no fences and have no experience
Yes
Yes
Not in my district
No we are not better off now
We are becoming poorer each year
We are worse off now than we were then
We consider it better to be paying the rent to the proprietor direct
When we pay to the proprietor direct we have only to make money payment but when we had to pay the rent to the tacksman we had other duties laid upon us as well as the money obligation
The services which we used to render to the tacksman in addition to the money payment are now included in the rent which we pay to the landlord
We used to give him in spring a days harrowing and in autumn two days reaping his corn
So we and the crofters would be cutting the tacksmans peats also and those of whom no service was required had to give compensation to the tacksman in the shape of the value of a lamb
Then the value of the lamb at first was stated at s d and as the price of sheep was increasing it came to be s and that is included now in the rent which we pay
Yes the s is included
Unless such are in MLeods country there are none of them in this part of the country
We are complaining also of the smallness of our holdings
I believe that even should they get enlarged holdings they are so much sunk in poverty that unless the Government would assist the people to stock the enlarged holdings they would be as badly off as ever
I cannot say that but there is plenty of land in this country itself which could be apportioned to them and which would support the whole of them
I cannot answer that question for the others but I know the greater part of them would not be able to stock the land unless they would get assistance
For my own part should I get an enlarged holding I would be able to stock it
I am not putting them to any school
We have no road to the school and we are far from the school
None of them who are on the upper side of the watershed
The school of Borve is the nearest
I believe it is about  miles from some of us
How can you expect weakly children to travel  miles in the dead of winter without a road and without any sheltering place intervening
No
There are mountains between us and the Glenmore school
This church in which we are met is the nearest to it
No and we pay road money and yet all that we carry to our townships we have to curry on our backs
Upwards of fifty children if not above fifty
At times an odd child might be coming for a week or two to school but they had a little school among themselves some years ago and they used to attend that school regularly
Yes
He frequently visits us
I cannot say that I do not know that but I think none of us have been summoned before the sheriff
No  no education at home
No not out of our township  none of them ever go to church
Yes a catechist comes once a fortnight to hold a meeting
The minister sends him once a fortnight
Yes
I cannot tell
They are in want of shoes and clothes and they cannot go naked to school
Very few of them can go to school in comparison with the number who cannot
Some of them can read and write who learn in this school
No more
Before we go further Mr Alexander Macdonald wishes to make a communication to us
I am sorry to hear that some of Lord Macdonalds tenants were a little afraid about giving evidence
I stated my own belief yesterday that there was no danger to any man for anything whatever that he said
I stated my belief and since this I have seen Lord Macdonald personally and told him that some of his tenants were perhaps a little afraid or backward and his lordship authorises me specially to inform his tenants that they have full liberty to state anything they choose to say whatever they think proper themselves to say without any fear of any consequences or any prejudice either from his Lordship or from me or from any factor
They have full liberty and scope to say whatever they think proper
We did not expect anything less from you
Yes
A fisherman
For the Crimean campaign and Indian mutiny
Yes the whole time from beginning to end
It was working when I arrived and I saw the campaign over before I came home
Yes
Half a croft
No
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes generally upon the same complaint that is going with the whole of us
Not much  we belong to a different estate from those that were here before us
Lord Macdonalds estate
Tote
As regards Tote and Benmore the crofts are poor in soil and rocky and not fit to give good crops owing to the poorness of the soil
In the best harvests it only gives two returns and frequently about one and a half
We are given three cows and two stirks on each croft but pasture ground is so bad small and poor that one cow and one stirk would be plenty for the grazing ground so as to keep them in condition as in other places
Frequently cows are two years without having a calf in this town and often cows will only have calves every second year
The cattle are handfed all the year round feeding them in summer and harvests with grass and corn to keep them alive
To keep the three cows and two stirks we would require three times as much of grazing ground
It is the smallness of the crofts and grazing grounds that keep us here so poor
If we would get more land with reasonable rent we know we would be well enough off
Us and our forefathers were subtenants for the last thirtysix years this includes the whole of Unikillin
There are ten crofts in Tote and Benmore and eight cottars in the place
The reason why so many cottars are here is in the years of  and  the potatoes failed and the late Mr Martin took some of them to the place and used to give them patches of ground for potatoes and also to be near the yairs
At that time the Fishery Board gave permission to have the yair put in good repair and those employed at it got one pound of Indian meal per day and the yair was a great boon to the poor far and near
A few years back the yair was broken down by orders of Mr L
Macdonald Skeabost and Tormore
Frequently at that time families would have nothing in the house at nights they would go to the yair and have plenty for their families in the morning
In this place seaware is not to be got from tacksmen without payment
When Mr Martin tacksman of Tote come to Unikillin in  of the rents on the crofts in Tote the cheapest croft was  s and the highest rent was  At the present time the rent ischeapest  s the highest  s
We have a club stock of sheep among thirtynine cofters but it does not pay well there is too many about the stock
Wet grouud and most of it too exposed also too small for the number about the stock
I may mention that in Tote there are ten crofts and sixteen families on the ten crofts and eight cottars besides them on the place now
To give pieces of ground to the cottars comes too heavy on the ten crofts there are so many of them
The yair was the reason so many crowded to Tote it supplied them constantly with fish
Regarding the hill pasture the neighbours wish me to state that formerly it was made a tack of by one who was in Lyndale that in the course of three years he lost his stock and had to leave it although he had a place which pays very well and another thing which we have been in dispute about for the last eight years is that we have been paying for a piece of the hill pasture and the tenants in Glenmore have claimed the place and we never got it yet
So we must take it in hand ourselves and compel them to leave
The factor promised to do it but it was always shoved off till now and we cannot bear it any longer
Thirtynine crofts and a number of them in halves and quarters
 need not say anything more because what we would say has been told beforescarcity of ground and pasture
Sebastopol Balaklava the Alma Lucknow and the Turkish medal
I have only one clasp for India but I should have had five for was in five engagements
Sixtysix years of age
I was in the nd regiment all the time
Where are they to be found
Not many of them would pass
There are sheep and deer instead of soldiers
They are old and worn out
They dont care about going
The place is cleared of men there are no young men now
I have none because from the way the people are used here they dont care to go
They have to make a living in other ways
No but the way the people are used here
When they see how their people are used there
Formerly the places would support their families behind them  now if a young man goes he has to keep his old parents alive he must remain at home and keep his father alive
From the way crofts are divided the ground is run out by tilling it every year and it does not give crops supposing the seasons were good
And then they go to some other better country and those at home take their places
Yes a good number
Several from my own place here died in the Crimea
I think there were a dozen in the same company with me from this part of the island
I have no idea but none from the island came through the Indian campaign and mutiny except one man over at Dunvegan
No
Yes but I was discharged
Yes and perhaps four
Yes there is one from Tote I know
I am not aware of any more
That is all that I know
I had plenty of reason to complain
Well for one time I had two years and four months without ever stripping or going to bed
From the time I left Portsmouth till I returned I never stripped
I was in clothes all the time and it was hard enough work for all I got
There is no doubt about that
It would show there was some care for the people and not to keep them about the corners as they are now
I am here in a croft and have nothing but rock and brae and if all the good soil were gathered together I do not suppose it would make more than an acre and a half of good natural soil
Well there is no way to do but breaking up the tacks
Upon Lord Macdonalds property at Skerrinish
They are well off now in the service compared with the time when I was in it but still it is a large family and there are always discontents in itI mean the service
There are in the army every class gentlemen and blackguards togetherthey do not care
This is the only thing I know of because young men as soon as they come to work must work to get money to support those at home and formerly little farmers were independent
They could live without the assistance of their children and the young men could go to list if they liked
Now since they can do nothing they must stay
Yes but they would make more money and get more stock
Certainly when there is nothing behind to care for
I do not know
Generally when a man enlists he does not look for anything
Both ways
I cannot say
They were very much mixed all classes farmers sons and so on
Yes but I think they are destroyed now
Yes in former times
By this mixing work
It is a great thing in the service to have a regiment from one district and it would be good for them in different ways because if I saw there a comrade from the same place as myself I would be afraid to commit myself in any way in case they would write home and tell my friends of what I was doing and how I was going on
That was the strongest motive ever I saw and it would make young men take care not to commit themselves
But when they are mixed up this way Irish Scotch and Lowlanders mixed they dont care so much
There is no person to tell
Well some think the short service spoils them because when they are properly learned their time is up and there is nothing more dangerous in a campaign than too many young soldiers
They are of no use
But if they had to meet Prussians or French it might have been different
I have seen young soldiers in the trenches at Sebastopol who were more a hindrance than an assistance
They were afraid and the work was so wild that it fairly frightened them and if the whole trenches had been composed of them they would not have stood one night
I have seen labourers go out there to assist in the trenches
Well sixty went in one night and we had only three in the morning
They went away through the night
We found them at Balaklava next morning
Yes I was elected here the other day
The second
I suppose about four acres between three and four
Yes
 s
 s for the whole croft
Yes  s
I keep two cows but if they have two calves I have too many
If I have two cows and a calf I have a calf too many for the land
The whole croft for three milk cows and two stirks
Thirty for the whole croft
Well it is a common stock we have what we can keep on the ground
Thirtynine
Yes about  at Martinmas
I do not know how many there are today
Yes
I have a croft
Yes
I am a farm servant to Mr Macdonald Skeabost
Yes
At the first one
Yes mostly
Some of it
No
That is what brought me here
The cause of our complaints is that we have so little land and so much of the waste and though our landlord would wish to do us justice he cannot
I have no more to say

Two cows and two stirks
The summing of the sheep should be eight sheep but I have not got them yet
No but although I had that land for nothing it would not support me
Not a single day this year
Yes but the wind destroyed it and I was obliged to give all that was left to the cattle
Yes
The potatoes are all gone this year
We had nothing left at all
Not a single potato
Yes I bought  barrels of potatoes and a boll of oat seed
Yes
No
Yes since eight or seven years ago
Mr Macdonald has given me a day of the horses to plough it and the rest of my family work it and I myself work it after hours for we get liberty at six oclock when the work is not very busy
Middling well but I am just doing all the best I can in hope my family will grow up to assist me to keep it in order afterwards and we hope the Royal Commission would see good to give us some of that land that is wasting in the Isle of Skye to support us
Yes  as you have heard before
The grazing belongs to Bernisdale and when Mr Macdonald came into the estate in  he let these two places to tenants and eight people came from Macleods countryRoag and Harlosh
They came to the upper Glen and some from Borve came to this estate and they rather crowded it
Just to get rent out of them
Yes because the late Rev
Roderick MLeod was the minister preaching here and people liked to be near him
Yes
 a year and  bolls of meal
I am paying for my croft out of my wages
None save one day of his horses in the spring time to plough my croft
From  to  and perhaps 
Yes
It is a hard question to answer but I think they were every bit as good on the  at that time as they should be to day at 
There is more extravagance going among people at this time
A great deal
Far better clothes
Yes two times
They require elasticsided boots instead of laced boots
Just a servant
No
No that is all we were talking of
That is all our complaintthe land is too little to support us
Half a croft
More than forty years
Yes I was a fisherman from my youth
I heard the most part of it
Our place is divided into three portions
Bernisdale
I am in the centre of Bernisdale
My successor is now located in the pasturage which belonged to the holdings on which I am now
We are much straitened by the smallness of the holdings and the crowded state in which we are
There are many half crofts on which nine souls liveeighteen souls on one croftand twelve on some and from that downwards and the population is double what I have seen it to be in my young days
The only thing that would remedy our ills as the previous witness alluded to is that we should get more land
As for me I am getting old and I will not need it but the rising generation will need it The land is all gone
We are cropping the land for the last sixtyeight years every year and the soil is just gone and should I sow a boll or two of oats maybe I will not have what I sow in the ground
Last year I had not what I sowed and the most of the people are in the same condition
I am speaking for the people as for myself
If they had what land would support their families they would be very well off
They might leave a piece of the ground out and sow it down with grass
That would make strong ground and it would produce good corn again
When I was here first in the year  before old Mr Macdonald bought the place we were very well off
We were not in need of buying any meal or anything because we had plenty of ground
W e had all the Glens that man possessed and some other glens and we are toiling that ground every year
W e had a fold for our cows and plenty corn at that time
I never saw my father buying a boll of meal all the time he was in the place
Four sons and a servant
How bad the day is that we have not a hill to keep a cow or a horse 
We cannot keep any cows on the hill or a horse
We have to till the ground ourselves with a crooked spade as a man told before and women are harrowing the place without a horse
But there is a thing worse than that altogetherwe will not get the ground toiled till May because we have no horse
The people hereabout who have horses labour their own ground before we can get any horses
Should I get a horse here I would keep a horse myselfI saw in the place here some years ago a man who had a horse and he had grazing in another place summer and winter and he brought it back here to the village and he was fined  s by the factor and ground officer for taking the horse to plough the ground
There were two of them fined for doing such a thing
When Mr Robertson was factor for MLeod
It was not by this proprietor at alL They got a summons of removal and they paid  s for that
Another bad thing that was done on the people here was this
When MLeod got the estate Kenneth MLeod who bought the place twentytwo or twentythree years ago there were only twentytwo crofts on Bernisdale
Well they had a cow a piece on the hill and a bit of the hill was left
The best part of the hill is in the hands of the proprietor himself where we used to have our cows and horses
When MLeod bought the estate we had only a cow and a piece on the hill  We are obliged to put sheep on the hill and the people when they sold their cattle were in debt and most of them could not keep sheep on the ground at all
He told them he would give them sheep till they would pay it or else that he would pay the grazing
So he put sheep on the ground himself and when he saw there was some profit in the sheepsome years they would have   or she never gave them a shilling for thegrazing
They were obliged to pay the rent and he had the profit of the grazing himself
Mr Macdonald the landlord that is here today followed the same state as his uncle
He promised to pay the people for the grazing of the sheep and when he went over again he would not do it at all
He would not pay them a shilling and that money is lying in the hands of Mr Macdonald yet for eight or nine years
When he removed the people from Skeabost he gave a few of them sheep gratis for removal
Yes he removed them from Skeabost eight or nine families and gave sheep to them but he never paid the grazing to the people
There is nothing left us but to get more land and how can any man live upon a small bit of land say  acres when there are nine souls upon that  acres
When the people till the ground they are obliged to go away to the south country or to the fishing to pay the rent and to pay the meal their family use all the year
Another thing is done here too
Surely if any of you gentlemen  is a proprietorand I see one proprietor here but he never did any ill to his tenants that is Mr Macdonald of Treaslanesurely you will allow the tenants to manage their own cattle and sheep
Surely there is no man who can manage my stock better than myself
Mr Macdonald has put a man over our stock to manage them
The present one
We are not allowed to buy or sell anything but the manager he sends over us to manage our sheep
Surely the proprietor has no right to take possession of the land that I am paying for to him
If the people allowed a man to build a little house on the pasture he paid  to the proprietor for that
The people are not allowed to get a farthing of that
When Mr Robertson was factor when Mr Macdonald was here there was a man out of our pasture and he charged  of rent upon him on the ground we paid
Is that right
Yes I saw a poor crippled man here that gathered a few oysters on the shore here and they put him in jail a poor crippled man with one leg put in jail for gathering a score or half a score of oysters 
No I do not think it
I believe it was by the orders of the present proprietor Mr Macdonald
He was proprietor at the time at any rate
Yes but they are all gone now
Yes they lifted them from all quarters here
Yes
Speaking about the seaware here when we had the seaware before it was divided into shares
It was the best seaware and they would cast lots for it and that was very good for the people to manure their ground
Today we will not get a dust of it unless I am a favourite with the ground officer of the proprietor
A favourite will get plenty of it  and it is not this year or last year or many years back
Oh sometimes
About two years ago they appointed me a bit of it and when I went there were only eight or nine creels of it and I left it to themselves
Very few
I do not know
No they dont but they went away themselves someway or another
I do not know what is the reason of that
Surely
I do not think it
No they would take them all but there are a few left
I was there about a month ago and I saw a few oysters there but there are not many
I do not think it
They were not prohibited from collecting any other shellfish except the oysters
The ground officer is managing our sheepstock since we joined them all together
It is only a few years back
Since then the proprietor put a manager over us
In the year  we joined stock
Yes  it was MLeod at that time
Yes they had cattle on the hill and a few sheep
Yes each had a share
Yes he possessed about seven or eight shares of the hill
He had a manager on the place and he had grazing himself
He never paid a shilling to the people for the grazing
They paid all the rent besides that
In the case of a man who pays   of rent maybe MLeod would get   or  or  for that poor mans grazing
From the income of the sheep
Mr MLeod had a share of the stock himself
There were about  sheep on the hill
There were twentytwo shares at that time and MLeod had seven or eight at any rate of those twentytwo shares and when the people could not stock the place he told them he would keep sheep on the hill for the people and that he would give them the sheep until they would pay it
No he did not give them that but when he saw there was a little profit on the income of the sheep when they were sold as wool and wedder he did not give them anything
He kept the profit to himself
He said  they pay the whole rent and they did not get any
Yes
The profit was  on each share
Every man would get his share and MLeod would get seven or eight shares
The rent was paid
And all the expenses
We were wanting him because he had the sheep on the farm to pay the grazing of the sheep to us
The grazing belongs to the tenant
Every crofter had sixteen sheep
The grazing belongs bo the people when they pay the rent
They would require to get payment for their own grazing from Mr MLeods d for every sheep
That would make  each he put in his pocket belonging to the people for eight or nine yearseight sharesso he had  that the sheep would make in the year
No
It was carried on by Mr Macdonald too
He promised to pay the grazing to the people and he did not do it
No because when he removed the people from Skeabost he gave eight sheeps grass to every one he removed
No
To seven of them
The tenants appointed two men to look after their own stocktwo of the tenants
Mr Macdonald said he must send a man over them too and so he did
Yes
He is the head man
He will do what he thinks proper himself
Yes
Yes
I know that about two years ago he gave the wool to the ground officer
The ground officer charged  s on the people for sending the wool to Glasgow
Another thing that the proprietor is doing very bad on the people is that he is allowing the ground officer to have horses along with their poor cattle
Is that right
Would any of you proprietors allow your ground officer to put one or two horses on the tenants land grazing
Surely it is not right
I do not know
When they go to work at some other place they will have it there
They work for the ground officer and the ground officer is working for people ploughing the land and it will be about   a day for a pair of horses
He has a croft but he had only a share of the pasture as I had
Along with the poor milk cows and the grassing for the milk cows was only like a market stance
The grassing was not worth s for every cow
There is no grassing at all We are obliged to cut the corn for the cattle in August and whatever is my crop I must leave a good piece of it for the cow or else she will die
No the ground officer had an objection against me and would not allow me to be there at all but the last day here the people selected menot the first day
Yes
I do not know
Yes
Yes
Yes
Because I am always speaking about what is going wrong in the place
My tongue is too long
Yes
The first day the ground officer had a number of mensix men he selected himselfand one of the men rose and said they would select me
 Well said he  I will not part with any that I have at all and the people did not say any more to him at that time
The people were always speaking about it after that that they would select me because I was here for a long time
I was here when General Macdonald was here about thirtythree years ago
Seventyfour
Yes
Yes my father and the family had two crofts in Bernisdale
Yes every one that was in the place except two men
There were twenty horses in Bernisdale
Yes
No they did not and as for those two men who had no horses the people of the place ploughed their ground gratis
Yes it is miserable and very bad for the weakest member of the family to carry a creel of ware upon her back and draw a harrow after her
No I did not hear that but I know that old women cannot do it
In my younger days I think we had better food than we have today
Yes
Yes
There were more potatoes and they could at a time take home a sheep and kill it and in winter time most ofthe people here would kill half a cow or a hail cow through the winter
They would have plenty of potatoes and plenty of meal when they had ground
I remember my sister coming from the hill after milking the sheep with three or four pints of milk every day
Sheeps milk
I know they had three times as much milk
Oh 
surely I do in my place today
They have no milk but very little
Mr Macdonald is giving milk to the people here about
No he gives the milk gratis
A few of them do but very seldom
Well they seldom do that
Not to the proprietor but they are in arrears to the bank
A good many of the people are going to the bank every year to pay rent
Yes
Not in debt when I was young in the place at the time of the markets three or four or five of the drovers would come to Bernisdale and go to the hill and buy a good cow from the hill and that would pay the rent in the meantime
Dealers came to the door for the cows and went to the hill to buy them
There were no lads going to the fishing at that time or to any place
I am sure there were only three or four young strong lads going away in my young days out of the country at all
This place supported them
There were only twentytwo at the centre of Bernisdale but there was another place near Aird
In the Glens and on the estate of Bernisdale there are about ninety families
It would keep twentytwo very good
There are seventythree I believe paying rent and there are twentynine poor that do not pay rent at all
In my days there was not a poor man in the place but four small houses and these men were better off that day than I am today and I will tell you the reason
They would get plenty of potato ground and they would get their ground sown with corn the next spring again and they were getting that gratis
They would have a few sheep on the hill gratis
I work at the roads
Yes
Yes
Yes
I was born in the parish of Strath
I live in Glen
Bernisdale
Yes
Yes
Any statement I make I would rather make in Gaelic
The first cause of the peoples poverty that I can mention is the smallness of their holdings and the clearness of them and that the soil is so poor that it does not yield crop
As a proof that our holdings are too small our only implement of agriculture is  stick with a crook at the end of it
We call it a caschrom and if the stick has not a natural bend we have to nail a piece to it Anyone capable of thinking must know that a man in two or three weeks cannot work sufficient ground with this implement to support a family of seven or eight
The place in which I reside was a pasturage that was taken from the people of Bernisdale fortyseven years ago
At that time twentyfour families were placed in the pasturage that was taken from the Bernisdale people and what was habitable of it was made into lots and we got a share of the hill that was taken from these people along with it
We had not that hill pasture long when the landlord took part of it away from us again
Donald Macdonald late of Tannara
He did not reduce our rents but he gave us seaweed as compensation for the hill pasture of which he had deprived us
He did not leave us the right of cutting seaware long before he charged us for it
The landlord then came to poverty and he lost the estate and was put under trustees and when the trustees came into possession they made some reduction of our rents but we continued to pay for the seaweed as we had been paying
When the late Mr Kenneth MLeod of Grishornish got the property we got back the right to cut seaware free but our present landlord makes us pay at present
Mr Lachlan Macdonald Skeabost We have however some seaware connected with our land free but we pay for the rest
He commenced to make us pay for the seaweed when he was at law about the shore
He was preventing us from gathering shellfishoysters
He was at law with one of his own tenants  and he did what was worse to us than that at the time
There was a yair in the loch which was good for catching herring
I have seen in one night more than  barrels of herring caught in it
The loss of the yair was worse to us than anything that was done to us since we came to the place
The landlord ordered the yair to be destroyed and the reason for that was that the people would be catching in the yair white fishsalmonand since the destruction of the yair not onefifth part of the quantity of fish that used to be caught in the river has been caught
I have not much more to say but that the people are crowded upon each other here
Skeabost and Bernisdale fifty years ago were in a very prosperous condition
Since then the tenants were taken from Skeabost and located in Bernisdale
When the tenants were put out of Skeabost I had two lots
One of these was taken from me to accommodate another man
When the late Mr Kenneth MLeod came into this property he laid five days work upon each crofter
He did not long continue to exact this labour from them but he laid an equivalent in money upon them  s upon each croftand the payment of that sum in addition continued till last Martinmas when the present proprietor gave us down that sum in name of reduction of rent
As there are other witnesses to speak after me I have nothing further to say unless I am questioned
I do not think there can be a more suitable remedy than to get more land at a suitable rent and security that we will not be evicted so long as we pay the rent and compensation for improvement
Hill pasture as well as arable land
There is not sufficient land for that purpose on this property to make comfortable the whole of the crofters upon it
I am not a fisherman
Yes down at Bernisdale there are fishermen
No doubt the fishing would be improved to those who are accustomed to fish if they had quays
At one time it was a good place but now it is not so good
I cannot answer that question
The pasturage was taken from the Bernisdale people and twentyfour families were located on that pasturage
They came from different places
That was before the people were removed from Skeabost at all
From different properties
Most of them came from MLeod of MLeods property
I was born in the parish of Strath and came here when I was about three years of age
Yes
My mother was a widow woman and the croft there was too heavy for her to keep and she came to this quarter
Lord Macdonalds property
I cannot exactly say but I think there were about twenty tenants in Skeabost the last time they were removed
I cannot say
It will be between seven and eight years so far as I can mind
Yes
Yes
Not at that time
Twenty families were removed from Skeabost
I do not know whether the whole of them were sent to Bernisdale or not
Yes that land is now in the proprietors own occupation
No
It was called duty work
Any work he would have to do
Working land and whatever work he would have to do
For his own benefit
No
Yes
Well I believe they have not in the meantime for what stock they have is not their own
No
It belongs to the merchants and to the proprietor
For meal
I was speaking to a man outside before I came in and he told me he had upwards of  on the Skeabost estate for meal
Yes
For arrears of rent
Well I cannot say whether they were all clear of rent but I know they were not so much sunk as they are at present
About fortysix or fortyseven years agobefore the pasture was taken off
No
I did not hear of that
We have a joint stock and mark  and our summing of sheep in Bernisdale is sixteen sheep and in Glen where I live it is eight sheep
There are two managers of the whole of the stocktwo of the crofters
It is sold in one lump
The money is divided
The very same
Two cows and two stirks
It is for the whole croft in the Glen
We have the same summing of cows as in Bernisdale but they have double the summing of sheep
One or two but the ground officer has two horses
Well I cannot tell the exact acreage and in case it might be said afterwards that I gave false evidence I would rather not say anything about that
Sometimes four and sometimes four and a half up and down as I can manage to get manure
About two bolls
Six bushels
Oats
No barley barley would not grow
No the soil being so poor
Till last Martinmas I was paying  but when the s for duty work was taken off me I only pay  s now
For the whole croft
Yes
Yes but I buy from  s to  worth of provender for winter for the croft will not produce so much as will winter the two cows and two stirks
I thresh some of the corn
Owing to the scarcity of it I must give some to the cattle without threshing
It would be cheaper for me to buy seed oats
In some places we cultivate the croft to the depth of  inches and in some places to a depth of  inch and in some places perhaps  inches
No it is seldom we can get that
A spade would not go through the rock
Where there is no rock there is gravel
I believe it could be made better by improving it
Yes
Yes
Well have seen when trenching and draining were going on but the result would he that they would be fined by the proprietor
A rise of rent and if they refuse to give the rise of rent they would be deprived of their holding and it would be given to some one else who would give the rise
Well it was not during this proprietors reign nor that of the proprietor before him
I believe they did and he gave a lease to a few
I think it was ten years
Not more but we could not improve the land for the production of the land would not keep us during the time we would be improving it
We had to be at other work to support our families
No I cannot be at home any day I can work owing to the kind of work I have
Keeping a piece of the road in repair
Yes
Not of late
No I do not think it was
No I cannot fix any date
I believe it will be as far back as twenty years agoat least no improvement I know of
There might be a little but nothing worth speaking of
I know it was the case in former times
It is not the fear of making the improvements but they cannot stay at home to make the improvements
I have no doubt but this proprietor would allow compensation for improvements if the people could stay
I know the present proprietor would not raise the rent
It did in former times but not now
I did not say they idled away their time in the winter time
No
In the township where I live some of them are in the service of the proprietor and some away working at other places They will be thinking that far better than improving the land
It is very seldom they can do any outside work in this quarter on account of the weather
I do
Not that I am aware of
Yes and the holdings enlarged
Yes
Compensation when the present tenant would leave
Well I do not know if they could find better places I believe they would
Yes if they could find better places I am quite certain they would leave
That is a question I cannot answer
They would get nothing in America but vacant land and they have plenty of that in their own country
No they would not like to go to America
I know that
Yes fixity of tenure and compensation for any improvements
By giving me a reduction of rents according to the work I did
Yes
No
It is all the samefixity of tenure or perpetual
Yes
Thirty or forty years
No
We would
Yes
Well we could not stock the land in our present position but through time we would be able to stock the land if we got it
We were thinking Government would be allowing some money to improve the land and that we would try some other means of stocking it
The bank might allow us money and get the stock for security
Yes
This is new stock
Well it is not the case with the whole though it is the case with some
No
Well that is a question I cannot answer
It is the banker who knows that
I know some who would stock the most of their crofts if they got larger holdings and that would give more room to the rest and maybe would improve their condition
Yes
Yes
I believe between  and some larger and some less
It is too large and in some cases we must take a horses work out of a woman we get them to harrow and while slavery is done away with in other countries it is likely to continue here
We have no horses
Yes and in some cases we have to wait
We are prevented by climate and weather from getting our seed in
We have to get a day and two days of a plough from other estates and we pay at the rate of  a day for a pair of horses and you might call it additional rent though we do not pay it to the landlord
But we have no keeping for the horses
All too poor to have horses
If I cannot winter two cows and two stirks how would I keep a horse
It was not enough at all
It was never subdivided
I had two crofts and one of them was taken from me
No they were not big enough
No for there was not a horse allowed on the estate
There was no grazing for horses
No I could not
Perhaps through time I might try it
No I know there is not
Give them crofts in neighbouring places
There is plenty of land there
No they do not
There is plenty of land at Skerrinish and Scorrybreck and Kingsburgh
I know that
On every side there is plenty of land fit for cultivation for most of it was cultivated before
Yes
Yes
I do in some cases
I know some are too dear in Bernisdale
Yes
My present croft is  s and I know it would be dear enough at 
It is not wintering for them and I buy between  s and   worth of provender yearly for them
No
Because I do not see a place worth asking a lease of
I could not improve it I was working
Yes for my family would starve if I should stay to improve the croft
I do not know
If I found the land sufficient to support my family I would give up any work except the land itself
Yes but  did not say that they all came to Bernisdale when Skeabost was evicted the last time
I cannot exactly say
I think there were more
Yes
Yes
Yes
Just a small portion of what they had formerly
They built huts for themselves
They were not houses
Yes
Well I do not think they did I do not know of any case where they did
No
No
They make their fences themselves
These were turf dykes
The roofs of the houses were valued and they were paid the prices
It depends upon what kind of roof is on the house
Some are valued at   and some at  and some are not worth s
That is according to how the proprietor and themselves would agree about the roof of the house
Yes according to valuation
Yes
Not that I am aware of
I think they continued to pay the same rent but you will hear witnesses from the place
From the moment they entered
The very same
No I do not think it but the pasture was taken off the Bernisdale people and what was fit for arable land was cut into crofts and given to the new people
I do not think it was
By getting the land stocked they would come to improve the land through time for I see other people who are keeping large families and thriving on these farms
If they would be able to buy it they would or if the proprietors would buy lime for them they would pay interest on the capital and instalments
If they could afford to buy tiles and I believe they would make stone drains
They would see Appendix A
II
Well it is abolished here
Yes
It is abolished
I think it is done away with altogether
No horses
They have no grazing for the horses
They cannot keep them
It was forbidden here for I knew people in Bernisdale fined for keeping horses
Because they do not get any work out of the horses except in the spring time for a few days and they get use of the cows all the year round
The landlord knows well enough there is no keeping for the horses
One horse will require as much grass as two cows
It would be of advantage
Sheep
They could not keep horses and they could not keep any more cattle for they would have no wintering for the cattle
Yes
It was placed on Lord Macdonalds estateon the other side of the loch just opposite this church
It was a stone dyke but one end of it was on dry land and going out with a semicircle into the sea and at ebb tide if the herring went in there they were caught by the dyke
By the authority of Skeabost and Lord Macdonalds factor together
For fear the people would be catching salmon
Yes very often
They kept the salmon for themselves for they had more need for them
I do for the herring would stand the same chance of being there as in former times
That I cannot answer but it is my opinion they would not
I believe that was the case but I do not mind of that
No
Yes
Yes
Well I dont know for I did not see that method in my time and therefore I cannot make any distinction
No
I am not sure
I am a contractor
From s to s d a day
I was not aware of that
They knocked down some pieces of that dyke so as to let out the salmon fish and they would be allowed to rebuild it again when the salmon fishing was over and then it was knocked down entirely
Yes
The landlord pays the whole expense of the house and charges  per cent of interest upon the houses he builds and in the case of any one who builds a house at his own expense the proprietor will give him compensation according to valuation in the event of his leaving or being removed
He gives them lime
Yes
I do not know whether they bought it themselves or whether he gave it them but I know that is the charge he makes for the money expended on the houses
There are no regulations except that they have to pay the interest for the houses along with the rent
During the summer season there were very seldom any herring got in the yair and the people would allow the wall to be broken down in some places so as to let the salmon out and then when the salmon season was over to rebuild it and it would catch the herring then
I think it could
The people would not be against breaking the yair in some places so as to let out the salmon and so that they could not catch the salmon
I do not know whether they would have the honesty of going to the proprietor with the salmon or not
Yes the salmon would go free in spite of them where they got a place to escape
Very small
I have been settled where I live at present for fortyfour years in the same croft
I know that they are far poorer than they were in former times when I came here
As to the food I do not know what food they eat I see very few of them takiug their food but I know they are poorer in circumstances for they are sunk in debt
Well it is very little I mind of that
I believe it was
Working to the proprietors round about here they would get Is a day and in some times of the year during the cutting of the hay and harvest a man would get s and a woman d or d
At this moment a man gets s from Skeabost and a woman s
They are worse off than when they got s
As to the cottars I cannot say much about them but the only thing I can say is that the cottars are a burden on the crofters
I do not know of any observation I have to make
I have made the only suggestions I know of for improving our conditionthat is plenty of land and reasonable rent
The large farmers have a better chance of making money than the small farmers where they have great tracts of land well stocked
I would think a reasonable rent for a croft capable of keeping five cows and a horse and between forty and fifty sheep should be about 
Double that rent
Yes
Well I do not know how far I would go on but I would think that reasonable
I know that people coming from better places buy land in the Highlands free for about twentyfive rents and we are here after paying twentyfive rents for our land and we have to pay the same yet
Not in one year
The principal grievances of which they complain are the smallness of their holdings the want of sheep on their common grazing and the way in which their crops are yearly destroyed by deer
That destruction is not so much now for the past two or three years owing to the present factors liberality in repairing the fence about the township
They complain very much of the way in which people from other townshipsremoved for the sake of enlarging the deer foresthave been crammed upon them abiding so many to the already too thickly peopled townships
They thinkit is the poorest township in the parish and especially owing to its connection with the deer forest
They complain much of the way in which they are dealt with by the gamekeepers
They are strongly under the impression that the gamekeepers are far more severe than their instructions from their superiors allow them to be
They blame the gamekeepers most for all the ills they suffer
The remedies they are anxious for in the meantime are that they get the liberty of keeping sheep upon the common grazing larger holdings at a fair rent and fixity of tenure so that the proprietor cannot remove them without just cause such as being so many years in arrears of rent
That is all I am instructed to inform the commissioners
Yes
Yes
Yes but at a great deal of expense which the crofters are not able to pay
About  miles
Yes
In some cases the deer would pass over such a fence
Round the arable land there is at present a fence of seven wires and the deer in some cases get over it and they are so viciousmore so than deer I see anywhere elsethat they twist themselves between the wires so as to get into the corn
I have seen it with my own eyes
They go on their sides to get in between the wiresespecially the hinds
I never saw stags doing it
They are very bad
Some of them are about the usual style of houses in the island
I could hardly answer that
Typhoid
The wire fence that was formerly round the cultivated land
It was very well for keeping out the deer from the pasture
No
Yes
Yes
They are not the same height in all places
At a place called Cluny in the possession of Earl Cowper
I cannot say
It was sufficient
Between  and  feet
It should
Yes
Yes
Yes
That is all
I do not think so
Yes it would
He did not now
Not cats
Yes in many a way
In preventing people taking thatch out of the forest
Yes
In some cases a mile or more
No and it is a thing very much used in the district to keep thatch on the houses and they are not allowed to cut it in the forest
They are allowed in a certain part of the forest but they cannot get all they require because the Braes and Sconser people get all their thatch from that forest
There is a certain part of the forest put out to them to get thatching but it is not near enough to supply all
Not that I am aware of just now
No not the least
Fifteen or sixteen years ago
I do not think it was ever a benefit
No it is not
It did a little help last year but not to the extent necessary
No until the present factor came in
I was born in Sconser
There was a deer forest before I was born
I am fiftyseven
Tormichaig
I cannot say but it was there in my earliest recollection
Yes I remember the people of three townships being removed for the purpose of their land being added to the deer forest
Aracharnoch by the side of Loch Eynort Moll Kenchreggan and Tormichaig
The township in which I was born was the fourth township
I am not sure there were two families in Aracharnoch eight families in Moll and four in Kenchreggan
There were twelve of us in Tormichaig paying rent and besides these there were cottars
I have not heard that there was any such allowance
Some of them went to America
I do not know
They were placed in other townships as the factor saw fit
No I do not believe there was  we did not get any at any rate
The ground officer valued the houses which we were leaving and the houses into which we were entering
Our new places were also valued
I built my own house
It was only a barn that I got when I went to my new lot I built a new house and bought the timber for it
That is so
When two families of us would be entering a lot on which there was only one house one of the families had to build a new house
They were old lands which we got
Of course there was
There were no new places ready for us and the factor was threatening he would cut the couples from above our heads if we would not quit
Mr Ballingall was the factor
Lord Macdonald kept the deer forest himself
Yes we had grazing for our stock as well as arable land
The houses we were leaving were valued for the landlord and as we were leaving them and were refusing to leave unless we got value for them
Yes
Yes that was the case
Yes of course the new houses we were entering into were worth more than the old houses which we left
Perhaps the house into which we might enter might happen to be worse than the house we had left
Generally speaking the house which we got was worse than the house which we left
The barn which I left at Tormichaig was better than the dwellinghouse which I got in the new township
Yes there was an allowance made
I cannot remember that very well as it is thirtyone years since I was removed
I cannot tell that as the tenants have been scattered into every place
I can only speak with regard to the tenants who were located in the township in which I myself was located
I cannot say
It was put into grazing
It has not been cultivated since
Yes
It was a mutual valuation
They made a roup of their stock
I have to say that I have been put to disadvantage since I went to my present place
The rent has been increased on me and the summing has been lessened
Ten shillings of increase was made on my rent and the allowance to keep a horse was taken from me
Yes
Two cows
My summing when I entered my present lot was two cows a twoyearold fourteen sheep and a horse
I pay  s of rent and with other assessments I pay 
No horse
I have sheep
I have been for eighteen seasons going to the east coast fishing and going south besides to work for wages
I would not be better off without the croft
I would rather have the croft
I would have no home without the croft
Nothing more
I consider it a particular hardship to have the rent raised upon me and my summing lessened
We had great liberties when we entered our present township
Our horses could graze up to Sligachan
Our fallow cows and our horses could graze up to Sligachan
We never said anything about that but we were claiming the right to it when we entered Camustionavaig
It was Corrie who was factor at that time and when he saw how high our rents were he pointed out a little spot on the hill where we could graze our horses during the summer and harvest
I do not say we had a right to Benlee but that our stock had the liberty of grazing there
No
I have been all my life on the croft which I now have and I am fiftyfour years of age
I have seen the reigns of three Lords Macdonald in succession and seven factors
I have half a croft and I pay  s of rent
The rent has been increased to me
I am the seventh of my name in possession of the lot in regular succession
Nearly onethird of the present amount
For the same ground which I now occupy
Yes
I have to bear testimony to the poverty of the township in which I am
I was for a number of years thinking it would be better for me to give it up than to be cultivating it at alL The land was rocky and was yielding no crop without manure in the way of seaweed which we could not get
We were at one time paying for sea weed but we cannot get it now for payment
To the late Mr Rainy of Raasay and on the island of Scalpa
Then for a number of years past we could not get it either at Raasay or Scalpa for love or money
From Is d to s a small boatload which would be equal to two cartloads or hereabouts
He did not spend any money on improvements on the place
We got at one time half a years rent remitted to us in consideration of drains we were making and we were paying s d in the  for the amount so remitted to us
Then there was s added to our rents for a bad bit of hill ground that was added to our grazings when Benlee was taken from the other three townships
Lower Olach
Yes
Yes
I do but there is one thing I wish to say I do not think there is much use of the herring fishing we get about here to support the people for it has been backward and doing not much good to the inhabitants about for the past twenty years
If we could get more land so as to let our present land rest and get heart
I do not know there is no such land other than what I have named alreadysuch as Scorrybreck and these places
I have to say that I have not for the past number of years taken three months good out of the land which I occupy and I have never taken out of it as much as would pay rent to the landlordI may say not even half rent
By fishing on the Irish coast and here and there on the east coast
I am not a fisherman at home
I fish away from home
There was no fishing at home for me to engage in
No there is no ware on the shore of Olach
This shore is a perpendicular cliff
We pay road money
It is a district road
No we give the cattle the fodder not the corn in the sheaf
I have only one cow and I cannot feed the cow off what grows on my lot
I have to buy feeding for her
I think there are three or four sheep
The summing of my lot is four cows and thirteen or fourteen sheep but the lot is not capable of supporting so much stock
The summering itself would not be very good but they could not do at all to be wintered
I have both heard it stated that the land was more productive in past times and I know it to have been so in my early recollection
In my early recollection there were no merchants in Skye bringing meal to the country and the men who needed meal would simply have to go to the north end of the island to what is now  Captain Frasers property and get meal there
Yes  and another evidence of the state of the tenantry of Lord Macdonald is that there are no mills going on Lord Macdonalds property at the present time
I cannot tell very well
There was one at Stenscholl and one at Camusmore one at Uig one at Romisdale one at Snizort one at Portree one at Broadford and I am not sure whether or not there was one at Knock in Sleat
The Portree mill is doing a little and possibly the Romisdale one but I know of none of the others
I do not know what they are doing on Captain Frasers property nowadays
What I mean is that there is no seed to grind
The mills are there so far as they have not fallen into decay and ruin
That is the case
I do not know whether or not the mills are being paid for to the landlord at present but the Portree mill is principally used as a woolcarding mill
I believe some of the millers do so far as I know
In my opinion the cause is that the land is run outexhausted and a stranger passing by cannot tell the quality of the soil by merely looking at it it is only those who work it
These are not used nowadays at all
One of these querns ought to be in the Braes
No doubt of that
The land we have has lost its substance and does not give crop
Yes
No
Yes six times
The lots were subdivided by order of the factor as the family of the crofter increased
It was done by the will of the factor
It could not be done in these days without the consent of the factor or will of the factor
I am not aware if any place that is not so subdivided already that it is not capable of further subdivision
If the crofts were not subdivided the one half of the people would have no land at all
That is not possible to them
I well remember a ship going with the people to America
From some not good accounts at all were coming but others got on well
I am not aware that more than two returned
They came to Sconser
They were giving a good account of America but for the closeness of the winter
I believe the emigrants themselves
I cannot speak as to that
I do not know the minds of the people as to that
We were not speaking among ourselves of emigration as one of the remedies
I have nothing further to say
Yes
Yes
I fully agree with all that they said
I have to say that during all my recollection ws got no work from the landlord
Upwards of twenty years
Yes
 s for half a lot
To get land as much as we could make use of
That would do us and our families good
The land which we have got is too shallow
In some places it is not more than one inch in depth and other parts of it are so rocky that it cannot be called land
We can make no use whatever of it and we are paying rent for it all the same
Yes there is such land
There is plenty of land on the farm of Scorrybreck plenty of land at Tormichaig plenty at Moll plenty at Kingsburgh and Skeinish and Glenvarigil and Corrie
There is plenty of land for every crofter on the estate if they got it
We could not stock it at the present time we are so poor
We have been obliged to spend our all for food and we in our township especially are poor because of our having been deprived of the hill pasture and having no land upon which we could live and what land we had dear
In some parts when I put down the seed I am obliged to take earth with the spade from other parts to cover the seed
Potato seed and oats as well
Even should the landlord order us to put more stock upon our land what could we do with them
We could not feed them unless we would put the one inside the other
When we have to buy food for our families and food for our stock how could we stand to it and the stock few
Our holdings on the land were serving no other purpose to us than affording us a home to which we could resort from our fishingfishing at Kinsale and the east coastwhere we were earning the wherewith to pay the landlord and feed our families
Some years our fishing would succeed with us and other years it would not aud what caused the rents to be so very high in this part of the land was that it was so close to the seasea that was open to all the people in England Ireland and Scotland as well as usand then oftenest it was people from those countries who were making better use of the fishings than we were
They wuld have more fishing material than we had
It was their trade
The little bits of land that we had were spoiling us for fishing
W e had to give our time at home to cultivating the landland out of which we were taking no good
I see the whole district around us in the same circumstances in which we are and that they all have their cause of complaint according to their real circumstances because they have been crowded upon each other and have no elbow room
The same land that is being tilled by us has been in cultivation from year to year since the time of our greatgrandfathers
My grandfather was ninetyfive my father eightyfour and  myself have been fifty years here
I remember seeing my grandfather and I have heard him say that the land which we are now cultivating had been cultivated in his time and before his time
If we could get assistance from Government to get as good boats as other places have
The fishing will not be about our coasts at all times
Yes some of them could do that
If they had better boats and better fishing material they could go elsewhere when the fishing at home failed them
That would be the case
They would be in danger of being broken
There are some townships about where the boats could be drawn up with safety
I have nothing more to say
If we had the land at a fair rent and besides that I think the land has been sufficiently paid for alreadypaying rent since the time of our forefathers
Plenty of them go to the south country to work
It is by their work in the south country that they are making a living
They are now going more to the south than they used to do in days gone by
Anywhere in which they hear that work is going on
A man who follows the sea wherever he hears seamen are in demand goes there and the man who is up to land work goes wherever he hears there are wages to be earned in that way
When we go to the east coast fishing we stay away for two months
Some of them leave the country about this time of the year and will be away until about Martinmas and others of them stay away till the next spring season comes
Yes
Yes some of them
I myself have been iti the habit of being away a whole year ever since I have been able to work
I mean after my spring work is done
I am away from home the whole year except the spring time
Last year I stayed at home expecting there would be fishing about but there was no fishing
Yes there are some poor widows in our township
There are six at any rate
Through some of their husbands getting drowned at the east coast fishing
They all have families
They live very poorly it cannot be otherwise
They have half crofts
Yes we would be better without them unless we got more land
Yes if I have not more land it would be better for me to be at work earning wages than to be hanging about a croft
Yes what I want is a good croft at a fair rent
Two cows
Two cows and a twoyearold
Nine or ten sheep
Seven or eight
I do not know if they are alive today but I think I have that number
No I could not
I cannot tell the number of acres but there is no more than one acre of it arable
 s and my share of the hill pasture of Benlee
Yes I think the land should belong to ourselves now
Yes I was elected a delegate
Yes
I think so
Mr MacdonaldI wish to say in ease of any misapprehension that all witnesses have the very fullest opportunity of saying whatever they choose true or falseI leave it to themselveswithout any fear of anything whatever from anybody
I was rather taken aback at first and was not prepared at the instant or else I would have said that but now I say it fully
WitnessI understand what is said
Yes
I heard and understood everything that was said
He was quite right in all he said
I would say somewhat differently from what he said in some things
As he said we were very much crowded by other people being placed in our townshipstrangers and we were also in trouble through our holdings being made smaller and the rents increased
We have particular cause for speaking in our own interest as regards the hill of Benlee which was taken from us
I can point out to the present day the sheilings which the women had in my grandfathers time on the hill and  we were looking upon it that we had full right of the grazing on Benlee
Fiftyfour years ago the then factor sent a ground officer from Sleat all the way to make up the summing of the hill for us and that officer is still living and it is he who told me about it
We were also much hampered by families from other townships being crowded in among us and part of our land taken from us for their accommodation without reduction of rent
I am free to say that there are twenty such families at any rate
Yes within my own memorythat is within the last thirty or forty years
Not a penny of reduction in the township in which I live
There was no reduction
Yes
To the landlord
Thirty or thirtyone years ago
There were some of them who got no land and others went abroad
Yes
I understand that grazing was taken from the tenants of Sconser for the purpose of the deer forest but not from the tenants of the Braes
It is seventeen years since the township in which I live was made smaller
The arable land
The rent was not increased on the township in which I live but the hill was taken from us and that lot of arable land
Yes the rent remained the same
One of the tenants who was taken from Scor
One family
It was of our own particular township that I speak
From Scor and another stranger came but he was instated in another mans place in our township
Twentyfour
I believe it was about that
Yes that is so
The rent remained the same
Yes
There were nine whole lots in our township and the ninth was taken from us and that lot was held by the township as vacant ground before the family from Scor got it
They were taking in that lot every third year
It was fallow ground and was yielding I believe crop of the value of 
I am not sure whether it is three and a half or four acres that is in our lots
That particular lot was the same size as the others
Yes
Yes
That particular lot had no right to the hill grazing
No they got no hill grazing they simply got the arable land
Yes
There were thirteen lots cut out but these were occupied by eight families at first
Then they increased till there were two families on each let
Yes they eventually came to twentythree families
I mean there twenty families taken into the three townships not into my particular township
No
Fifteen or sixteen years ago
Two of them came from Scor to the township in which I am
Another came from Tormichaig
Others of the Tormichaig tenants were placed in Beinnachorrain the township which is next to mine
I cannot be very sure altogether from what townships the remainder of these twenty families came but I believe some of them came from as far away as Nairn
Five of the Tormichaig tenants were placed in the two townships
The principal reason I am aware of was that at the time of the Disruption the factor was very much against the Free Church and some of the families were removed because of sheltering elders of the Free Church
Tormichaig and Kenchreggan which is a township near Tormichaig
They themselves were saying that they were very much better off where they came from and they were very much lamenting their removal
As to those who were removed from Tormichaig I do not know but they were removed for a deer forest
Yes
Yes
The township of Tormichaig had their grazings in what is now part of the deer forest as well as the arable land of Tormichaig
That is the best opinion I can give
Yes each of these twentythree families is paying rent to the landlord besides cottars
The twentythree include the cottars as well as the crofters
No they are not paying the same rent
The crofters pay much about the same rent
Two or three are cottars  but each family does not pay the same rent
The lot in which I lived was paying  s before the rent of Benlee was put on but there are two or three families on the lot
I myself pay  s
Thirtytwo shillings and a few pence
When the township had one family on each croft and the whole pasture besides they were making a living
Four or five cows
Yes but they got leave from the then factor to keep six cows
Before Benlee was taken from us
To the best of my recollection eighteen sheep
We could keep thirtysix sheep on each lot when we had the hilL
I would prefer a bigger croft if I could get it
I think that one crofter should make a living out of eight acres of ground with grazing
Four or five cows forty or fifty sheep and one horse
We are allowed to keep a horse
No each crofter has not a horse
Not now I could not stock such a croft now
I do not think there are many who could stock it
In my opinion  or  would be quite enough
The rents at present are too high
I cannot say as I have no experience
Yes I consider the rents are too high on this estate
I do not think that the rent which I named would be dear for such a lot
I think a man could make a good living out of it
I believe in my own township a great deal of money is lost through the want of a quay
They have to go elsewhere with their fish to sell them though it is considered that is the best place for disposing of their fish to the fishcurers
I do not think there is a place thereabouts where a quay could be easier constructed than in my own township of Balmeanach
Yes as I see is being paid for accommodation at other quays
There is fishing to be got for the most part during the whole year except a month or two in the spring timeherring fishing
No they would not have to go far from the shore
No distance from their own dwellings
We need the quay principally for the purposes of the fishing
We could do without the quay so far as our other purposes are concerned
There is no year in which a curer does not comefour of them
To our township of Balmeanach
We cannot draw our boats up in all weathers
Every second week almost we cannot draw up our boats
Bad land
The half of it consists of a depth of two inches of soil on rocks
My whole crop of potatoes and corn will not sustain my family for onethird part of the year
Yes the potato crop was a failure last season
Yes we got some assistance
I think so I think we are satisfied with the way in which it was divided
I am not aware of any
Yes I know a few  I know some who have a little money in the bank
The father of my predecessor in the lot gave the half of it to his son by order of the factor
It was with the wish of the family that the croft was divided
No it has not increased
Some years I sell one stirk and perhaps two sheep and some years I am not able to sell anything at alL
The price of stock rose about the time I got the lot or shortly before I got it
Much about the same
Never
Nothing I am not able to sell any of the produce of the croft other than the stock but I am under the necessity always of buying
I have spent  this year upon meal alone
Yes
About eighteen bolls
Food for the family
There are nine of us in the family
I do not know that I have anything more to say
I want to say a few words in English
It seems that Mr Macdonald objects to my evidence because I am only a crofters son
My great grandfather was in Beinchoran
I do not say he was born there but my grandfather was born in Beinnachorrain and lived in Beinnachorrain eightysix years
He died there
My mother was born there and is living there yet at the age of eightyfour
I am forty years of age and am living in Beinnachorrain
I am married and have a family
I have been paying rent in Beinnachorrain to Lord Macdonald for fifteen or sixteen years and I think I have the right to bear evidence today
The principal thing that we have to complain of is our poverty and what has caused our poverty
The smallness of our holdings and the inferior quality of the land is what has caused our poverty  and the way in which the poor crofters are huddled together and the best part of the land devoted to deer forests and big farms
If we had plenty of land there would be no poverty in our country
We are willing and able to work it
The principal hardship I see is that the people cannot take a crop out of the ground
The ground does not yield crops to them
What would remedy the peoples grievances throughout the island of Skye is to give them plenty of land as there is plenty of it and they are willing to work it
I have complained of the rent that is charged us
The rent is heavy
Thirtytwo years ago drainage money was laid upon us and though in sixteen years both principal and interest was supposed to have been paid up we are still paying the drainage money and it is our being deprived of the hill pasture of Benlee which has thrown us back so much the past number of years
Though the hill of Benlee was taken from us not only was there no abatement made in our rents but the rent was increased to some extent and in evidence that the hill was part of our original holdings up to sixteen or seventeen years ago we were receiving   of money rent from the landlord as consideration for accommodation which we were making on the hill to Lord Macdonalds gamekeepers
I remember the factor clearing a township and devoting the townships land to the purposes of the deer forestclearing them out of their houses and settling them down among the Braesfrom Tormichaig Sconser
He settled a widow and her family down on my fathers lot with the intention that my father would share with her the peats and the half of the croft and that without my father having been duly warned and without his being in arrears of rent
When he went to the factor to complain of this proceeding the factor told him that if he would not give her room he would not have a sod on Lord Macdonalds property by the term
Mr Ballingall
It is thirtyone years since this township was cleared for the purposes of the deer forest
I cannot say but I believe he was
When he could not force this widow and her family upon my father there was a poor weakly man in our township who was put out of his holding for her with his family
He was put out of his holding for this woman and the woman was installed in his place
The poor man with his weak family was evicted and he got the stance of a house outside the enclosure of the township
It is a great hardship that all our earnings at the fishing we have to put into meal for the support of our families and that altogether because we have not land which will yield a crop but land which has been cropped continuously for the past thirty years within my own memorycontinually cropping the same land and as to the seed that we put into the ground we cannot get back out of the ground twothirds of what we put into it
We do not get the seed back
We dont get more than twothirds of the seed we put into the ground
I do not mean that that is so every year
Some years will be better than that
Last year we had not onethird of what we put into the ground and the year before we only had one and a half bushel over and above what we actually put into the ground
It is easy to answer that
Give us land out of the plenty of land that is about for cultivation
That is the principal remedy that I see
Give us land at a suitable rentat a rent within our power and to pay
There are thirty tacks in the Isle of Skye and there are many of these capable of supporting hundreds of families in comfort
The suitable land surrounds us on every hand Scorrybreck Glenvarigil Sconser Corrie Broadford and all the way down to the point of Sleat
The whole of that land is suitable land for cultivation
Yes unless we can get that poverty will not be got out of the Isle of Skye for ever we will always need a Joseph in the south country to send us seed unless we get an extension of our holdings in that way
I have not the mind of the people sufficiently to say how far the people would wish to migrate for that purpose
I at any rate would go any distance to get good land and I think my neighbours would be of like mind
If the landlord would not build houses for us the Government might assist the people
If we got the land for ourselves we would build the houses
I am very sure that if the people get the land just now in large farms given back to them at the old rent which they were paying when it was taken from them they would pay it
I make out that there is a great difference within my recollection because I see every time a new tenant comes to these big farms he always gives a rise of rent
I think it would be advisable they should get the assistance of Government to stock the land if they could get it
I think the crofter would be very well off who would have enough cultivated land to support his family in comfort and that he should get as much money as would enable him to put between fifty and a hundred sheep on the ground
Four or five cows would do much good
The erection of march dykes would not be very expensive as we now use themhaving a common outrun outside the cultivated ground
Yes
That would be required for the ground we would  get
I think that the same tenants would be much better in every way immediately under Government
I do not believe there are any who would be able to do that
Yes
It is the townships of Skye generally that I allude to
I think that in other parts in Skye they are as closely huddled together as in the Braes
I cannot say but they are worse in some parts than in the Braes
I cannot tell the exact acreage of my fathers croft but I can say there is not one acre of it worth cultivating or worth putting seed into
Rocky mossy land where I might catch a deer it is so boggy  and other parts of it are as hard as adamant
 s
It has been the rent since the drainage money was laid on but it was not so dear before that
I am not speaking about the rent of Benlee
I am not including the rent of Benlee in that
I think it is about 
Some years more some years less
Four cows oftenest
Nine or ten sheep on the hill
Some years there would be a stirk and other years there would be none and some years we might have two stirks
We were giving them fodder that was grown on the land for there was no seed on it
We had to keep the seed to sow the ground
I have not tasted Highlandmade meal for the past four years
In my grandfathers time there were no tenants in Beinnachorrain
Twentysix or twentyseven
Part of them were cleared off the present deer forest and then there was an increase of the township
The poor crofters themselves
May the Lord look upon you
I have seen myself compelled to go to the deer forest to steal thatchto steal the wherewith to thatch our houses
If we had not done so we should have had none and I went in the daytime for this purpose and was caught by the gamekeeper and I had to give him part of what I hadpart for the purpose of thatching his own house
In Sconser
I had to go across the ferry to Sconser for the thatch
No no assistance
He would refuse us timber even should we go for it I have seen us refused
It is from Raasay that we get our timber and the wherewith to make the creels for us to carry the manure for cultivation to our ground and the crooked spade for tilling the land
We have to get it all from Raasay
Sometimes they might get timber to buy from the landlord
To the present day during my recollection
Paying for some of it and for some of it not
It is very little they were paying of it
Yes
No there was a bit of it at the back of the hill that was common to other townships than our township
No on the Glenvarigil river
It was suitable for the purposes of the Sligachan market which was held then
Yes every one that came from the Long Island
No all using the hill of Benlee for the purposes of the market got the use of it free
Not to my recollection
It was at the head of Loch Sligachan about a quarter of a mile on the side of the hotel
Most of them
A little
All sorts of fish but some sorts we are not allowed
Yes
There are cod and ling to be got
Not regularly
We principally fish for herring regularly
Most of them have a boat each
There are a good number of them without boats
They are so poor that they cant get boats
Very few in the Braes were destroyed by that storm
We have ware on our shoresthe shores of our own particular townships but Balmeanach and Gedentailler have to go to Raasay for seaware they have not got enough themselves
I do not believe they pay for it in Raasay the landlord is so good to them
There was but it was a small dispute as it is now settled in a sense
They are not satisfied
They complain that for the hill which was part of their holdings in time past they have now to pay  s
The hill they had seventeen or eighteen years ago is part of their holdings they are now made to pay  s for and they complain of that
They complain that the sum is too large
That is their complaint concerning Benlee that they are charged too much rent for it and I will now tell you two reasons why they offered rent at all for the hill
In the first place there was blood shed about it and they were sorely threatened by the law of the kind and they offered a rent for the hill for peaces sake which they were not able to pay and there was a gentleman who put a thousand pounds aside in order to make peace between Lord Macdonald and the crofters and the most of the people were of opinion that this thousand pounds would be assigned for the purpose of stocking the hill when they got it but that expectation failed
Yes
It is other parts of the island of Skye that I mean but it is better that we should even emigrate abroad than be starving as we are but we would rather be in our native place
Yes  it is not money for nothing that we are wanting at all
I am sure of it
We think the crofting better than the fishing
Yes  our small townships are mostly in need of such
No no made place
No not at our place at any rate
We did not think about that and I cannot say much about it but  believe the crofters would be wilting to pay a small sum
Yes and besides that I declined to go not because I would not tell the truth but I was afraid that in consequence of the evidence I would give here the landlord might revenge himself upon me
I believe I am one of the four who were first chosen but I was not present
My father told me
He was present and my neighbours told me
Yes
Every day in my recollection they have been talking about it
That the people if they were under Government would not be shuffled here and there as they are now and that they would not be huddled on the top of each other
What I mean is that the land laws should be altered
Yes that is what I mean
The queen should be the landlord
What I mean is that good landlords should be pat on the land and that the people should have the land given to them
I do not know but I think we could if the whole were stocked and a likely rent laid on it
I do not know I cannot say
Yes  the reason is that we have not land sufficient
We cannot leave any part of our cultivated land out we have too little of it
What would we cultivate if we were to leave half of it out it would not be worth our while to cultivate it
What would feed the cattle for us if we were to leave half of it out of cultivation
I have tried to drain it till my heart is nearly broken with it
Yes we thresh the corn
Yes we thresh the whole of it
We may give an occasional sheaf to a beast unthreshed
I forgot something about the Benlee stock
I have to say that Mr Mackay the former tenant stated in my own presence and that of my neighbours that Benlee never put a coat on his back and how could we expect to make profit out of it
I mean if we get the land freeif we could get the land in property and the Government to assist us to buy it
It was beneficial
We now cultivate under the level of these old drains for the land has wasted away and the drains have come to the surface
No the land that was then drained is even worse now than it was then
Last winter
 s
I think it was 
Not a head I think but a few head which the people have been allowed to graze on it
Some of them may have put more or lessstock on the hill but the most of them have not been able to stock it
Unless they get help outside in some other way I do not know how they can do it
I think some of them are present here today
I am not sure
Yes there was a sma
l township opposite Portree the inhabitants of which were taken to the Braes
No
It is added to Benehler
The Braes people have not got it but the Benehler people have it
The crofters of the township which was clearedthat is Scorwere put in among the crofters of the Braes
Balmeanach and Achnahannait
I know two families who were taken from Scor and were placed in Balmcanach and a croft was taken from the tenants and given to one of these families
I cannot tell that
I think I will let the other delegates speak now
In the first place I may say that I am surprised at this mans statement because he is not one of our crofters at all
He is a crofters son he is not a crofter
That is the first thing
In the next place I do not think that he has any reason whatever or that any person has any reason whatever if he tells the truth and nothing but the truth to fear anything
In fact we consider it rather insulting to us to insinuate anything of the sort
We despise to do anything of the sort
We expect and trust that the men will tell the truth and nothing but the truth and the whole truth
I believe not
That is all I can state on my own property certainly there will not be and I believe on no property
In fact such an idea never entered our heads but we expect the people will tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
Most certainly but this I would say if we hear any man making a grossly false statement against us which we can prove to be false I do not think that in human nature it would be found we should like to continue that man as our tenant
If there is any statement which is made by a man thinking and believing it to be true even though we ourselves differ from it we would never dream of using any power that we have but if the man tells a parcel of unfounded lieswhich I do not believe any man here or elsewhere in Skye will do until I hear itthat is a different matter altogether
So far as we are concerned the people have full liberty to tell everything they have to say without any fear
These are my own personal feelings and certainly so far as the properties for which I am factor are concerned they will never know or hear anything about itso far as I as factor am concerned
I expect that he will tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and so far as I am concerned as factor I will visit in no way anything upon him and I believe Lord Macdonald will do nothing
I give him the fullest assurance
Certainly we expect the man to tell the truth
I believe I am quite at liberty to say so
I believe I am perfectly at liberty to say so and from the first I could have said so
A crofter
Yes
Born at the Braes
Not all my life
I have been away but not very far off
From time to time
Yes
Yes
Yes but it is in Gaelic that I prefer to speak
Yes
I would wish that I should have an opportunity of saying a few words before I tell that and that is that I should have the assurance that I will not be evicted from my holding by the landlord or factor as I have seen done already
I would not have a fire in my house at Whitsunday I want the assurance that I will not be evicted for I cannot bear evidence to the distress of my people without bearing evidence to the oppression and highhandedness of the landlord and his factor
No
