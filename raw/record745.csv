"1","HUGH CARMICHAEL, Fisherman (40)—examined.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",1
"2","46194. The Chairman.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",2
"3","—Are you proprietor of more than one boat, or are you strictly a fisherman yourself ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",3
"4","—A fisherman. ",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",4
"5","46195. Have you any land ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",5
"6","—Yes, I have a small cottage and garden.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",6
"7","46196. But have you any kind of croft or field ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",7
"8","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",8
"9","46197. Nothing but the house and the stance ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",9
"10","—And a small garden.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",10
"11","46198. Professor Mackinnon.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",11
"12","—You have been engaged in fishing all your life ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",12
"13","—Yes, mostly.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",13
"14","46199. In this place and round about ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",14
"15","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",15
"16","46200. So that you know the condition of the fishing in Loch Fyne thoroughly well ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",16
"17","—Yes, pretty well.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",17
"18","46201. Of late years, I suppose, the fishing has improved very much in this place ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",18
"19","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",19
"20","46202. To what do you attribute this improvement?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",20
"21","—There are various reasons. The first reason is that there are screw steamers plying between here and Glasgow, and we get a better price owing to that. In former years there were no screws, and of course the price was not so good. Since these screws have been introduced, the price is double what it used to be formerly.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",21
"22","46203. In addition to getting a larger price for the fish, do you think there is more fish landed now in the village here ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",22
"23","—Yes, owing to the trawling system.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",23
"24","46204. So there are two causes—there is more fish caught and there is a better price ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",24
"25","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",25
"26","46205. When does the fishing season begin here ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",26
"27","—There is no close season at all",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",27
"28","46206. But when do you actually begin to fish ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",28
"29","—In May.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",29
"30","46207. And you continue right on from May till when?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",30
"31","—Till December.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",31
"32","46208. Of late years, I understand, a good number of the fishermen here go over to the Ayrshire shore ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",32
"33","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",33
"34","46209. When do they go there ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",34
"35","—About the beginning of January.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",35
"36","46210. And they are there, off and on, for about two months?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",36
"37","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",37
"38","46211. And from that time till the fishing in Loch Fyne commences again they are at home ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",38
"39","—Yes, they are at home.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",39
"40","46212. What do they do during that time?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",40
"41","—They prepare their nets and boats for the beginning of May.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",41
"42","46213. Is it the skill's you use here that you use on the Ayrshire coast ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",42
"43","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",43
"44","46214. Do you find thev suit quite well on that rough shore?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",44
"45","—Yes, they are very suitable. Of course, they have got them larger these few years back.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",45
"46","46215. They are getting larger year by year ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",46
"47","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",47
"48","46216. Is that specially for the Loch Fyne fishing or for the Ayrshire fishing ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",48
"49","—For the Ayrshire coast. They would do smaller for Loch Fyne, but larger boats are required for the Ayrshire coast; it is a rough coast.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",49
"50","46217. You do not live in the boats; you live ashore ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",50
"51","—We lodge ashore when we go to Girvan.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",51
"52","46218. Do you carry on the fishing by trawling at night, just as here?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",52
"53","—Yes, just in the same way.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",53
"54","46219. You have not such a good harbour there ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",54
"55","—No, it is not good at Ballantrae or Girvan. Of course they have improved Girvan harbour this year.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",55
"56","46220. Can you enter it at all states of the tide?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",56
"57","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",57
"58","46221. Where do you go?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",58
"59","—We have to lie at anchor off the mouth of the harbour till the tide makes, in a storm. It would be of great advantage if the mouth of the harbour were made deep, so that boats could get in at any time.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",59
"60","46222. Is it of late years that that fishing has developed?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",60
"61","—It is a good many years since.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",61
"62","46223. Where do the fishermen go from to that place?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",62
"63","—From almost every fishing port in Loch Fyne—from Campbeltown, and down by Troon and Ardrossan, and all these ports.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",63
"64","46224. Have they much the same style of boats that you have?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",64
"65","—Yes, most of them.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",65
"66","46225. They are not big boats, in which the men sleep?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",66
"67","—Well, this year or two back they have been getting what they call decks, and they live in them now.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",67
"68","46226. It is just a larger skiff, with a deck?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",68
"69","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",69
"70","46227. But there are none of the big boats that we find on the north and east coasts ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",70
"71","—These would not suit for that coast at all; they would be too large. There is plenty room to work them, but they would not be suitable for that fishing at all.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",71
"72","46228. Is that because it is too near shore ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",72
"73","—The boats would be too large; they could not work.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",73
"74","46229. They could not pull the trawl ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",74
"75","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",75
"76","46230. I understand you consider your own skiffs large enough for that purpose ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",76
"77","—They are quite large enough, worked with the oars.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",77
"78","46231. Then you have given up entirely the white fishing in the winter ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",78
"79","—There are very few boats prosecuting the line fishing.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",79
"80","46232. They used to go to the west shore for the line fishing ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",80
"81","—Yes, they used to go with the long line to Jura Sound, and some boats prosecute it yet from here in the beginning of spring.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",81
"82","46233. I suppose you yourself were engaged in the fishing years before trawling was legalized?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",82
"83","—Yes, with drift nets.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",83
"84","46234. These have been entirely given up, or nearly given up ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",84
"85","—They are nearly given up, especially in Tarbert; but they have been prosecuting the drift net fishing in Upper Loch Fyne more than here, and it has been almost a complete failure this year.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",85
"86","46235. Your fishing here for the last two or three years has been quite as successful as ever it was ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",86
"87","—For about four years it has been very successful with the trawl.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",87
"88","46236. So, whatever may be said about other places, trawling has not injured the fishing here ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",88
"89","—Not in Loch Fyne.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",89
"90","46237. The fishermen consider the trawl of great advantage as compared",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",90
"91","with the old drift net?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",91
"92","—Yes, it is a great advantage to them, and it is a great advantage for the market too. They get the fish earlier than they would by working with the drift net. ",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",92
"93","46238. Do you mean that you pull the trawl earlier in the night?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",93
"94","—Yes; we fish in daylight too. ",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",94
"95","46239. So you can send away the fish at any time?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",95
"96","—Yes. ",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",96
"97","46240. Has the population increased in the place within your time?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",97
"98","—Yes, very much. There is double the population in the town, I think, than there was twenty years back.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",98
"99","46241. Has that been by fishermen coming from the outside and settling, or by people growing up in the place ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",99
"100","—By people growing up in the place.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",100
"101","46242. Are there many fishermen who have come in from the outside to Tarbert ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",101
"102","—Not very many.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",102
"103","46243. They are all the people of the place?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",103
"104","—Yes, there are very few strangers.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",104
"105","46244. I suppose this has been a herring fishing station for a long time back ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",105
"106","—Oh yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",106
"107","46245. Have the people always been fishermen, fishing summer and winter, as they are now; is that the way it used to be in old times ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",107
"108","—So far as I remember, they did not follow it in winter; in olden times they only followed it during the summer.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",108
"109","46246. What did they do during the rest of the year?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",109
"110","—Some of them had crofts, and others went away to sea, and so forth.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",110
"111","46247. Are you acquainted with the conditions of life away in Skye and Lewis?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",111
"112","—I was only two years fishing north.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",112
"113","46248. Was this the kind of life they led here a good while ago, —partly engaged with the crofts and partly engaged with the fishing at home and elsewhere ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",113
"114","—I think so. There were a good many who had crofts about a mile out of the town.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",114
"115","46249. These went also to the fishing?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",115
"116","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",116
"117","46250. But they have given these crofts up ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",117
"118","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",118
"119","46251. The fishermen have no crofts now?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",119
"120","—Very few. Three or four, or perhaps half a dozen, have crofts, and follow the fishing too.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",120
"121","46252. How do they get their crofts attended to?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",121
"122","—They work them partly themselves, and their families.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",122
"123","46253. But they do not remain at home from the fishing to work the crofts ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",123
"124","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",124
"125","46254. As the fishing is carried on here, with a ready market, and with a good fishing ground for so long a period of the year, do you think it would be an advantage for a fisherman to follow both occupations or a disadvantage ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",125
"126","—It would be no advantage just now, in the present circumstances, seeing the fishing is doing so well; but in the event of the fishing failing in Loch Fyne I think it would be an advantage for them to have crofts at a reasonable rent, because there is no other work that could be done in this village by which they could earn a livelihood; they must leave home and go to sea.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",126
"127","46255. But with the Loch Fyne fishing as it is?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",127
"128","—As it is at present, they would do as well without crofts.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",128
"129","46256. You do not think they could work both?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",129
"130","—Not very well, owing to the way the fishing is prosecuted now, because they work day and night, you may say, at the fishing.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",130
"131","46257. And it will take up all their time?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",131
"132","—It will take up all their time.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",132
"133","46258. And you think that as things are in this place, it would be better for the man who would be a fisherman to be a fisherman, and not be hanging about between the two things ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",133
"134","—Yes, that is my opinion.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",134
"135","46259. Of course that would depend entirely upon the circumstances of the place ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",135
"136","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",136
"137","46260. In this place that would be the best, in your view ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",137
"138","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",138
"139","46261. How many nets has each boat, with the trawl?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",139
"140","—They have only one trawl net in each boat.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",140
"141","46262. What is the length of it ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",141
"142","—About 90 fathoms",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",142
"143","46263. And the depth?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",143
"144","—About 18 fathoms.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",144
"145","46264.. And there are always two boats working together?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",145
"146","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",146
"147","46265. They arrange among themselves at the beginning of the season which two boats shall go together?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",147
"148","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",148
"149","46266. And they work together the whole season ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",149
"150","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",150
"151","46267. I suppose their two trawls are attached end upon end?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",151
"152","—No, there is only one trawl in each boat, and when they come across a shoal of herrings the one boat shoots round the shoal, and each boat pulls in its own net; and then, when the net is at the stern, they lift it out of the water, and if there are fish in the net they take them into the boat.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",152
"153","46268. Has the net a bottom?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",153
"154","—Yes, and there is a sole rope to the bottom of the net.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",154
"155","46269. So you can make a complete circle?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",155
"156","—Yes; we can either draw to shore or wring out in deep water.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",156
"157","46270. Which is the more common practice?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",157
"158","—Drawing to shore is the most common.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",158
"159","46271. And, I suppose, the surer to catch the fish?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",159
"160","—Exactly.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",160
"161","46272. There is less danger of the fish slipping away from you ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",161
"162","—Yes. There is one thing I would suggest, viz., a weekly close time, which would be a great advantage to the fishermen at Loch Fyne. I mean a close time from sunset on Saturday till sunrise on Monday.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",162
"163","46273. That you would not be allowed to fish between these two times ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",163
"164","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",164
"165","46274. Is that not the law just now ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",165
"166","—If it is the law, it is not carried out. There are fishermen from Campbeltown allowed to fish on Sabbath and at any time they choose, and we the fishermen of Tarbert are at a great disadvantage in that respect. It would be a great improvement if there was a weekly close time, so that all fishermen would have the same opportunity on the Monday morning. There would be better prices, too, because the market would not be open to receive the fish on the Monday.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",166
"167","46275. So that the Sunday fishing injures the market and diminishes the supply of fish?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",167
"168","—Yes, and it would be an advantage for the herrings themselves. They would come in to the shore better if they got quiet from Saturday till Monday morning, seeing the whole fleet is working the whole week just now.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",168
"169","46276. As to those that do go out, I suppose it is in the early portion of Saturday night or Monday morning that they go out ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",169
"170","—Yes, and some of them work on Sabbath.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",170
"171","46277. And those who do that have a great advantage over the others ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",171
"172","—Yes, of course; and we wish to have them all put on an equal footing, so that every fisherman would have a better chance.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",172
"173","46278. You think the total supply of fish would be quite as great as it is now, supposing the Sunday fishing were put a stop to, and it would be fairer to all the people engaged in the fishing?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",173
"174","—Exactly.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",174
"175","46279. Sheriff  Nicolson.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",175
"176","—Is this the principal fishing station on Loch Fyne ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",176
"177","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",177
"178","46280. And it has been so since time immemorial ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",178
"179","—Yes, on Upper Loch Fyne.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",179
"180","46281. The whole of Loch Fyne has been a good place for herring, so far as history tells us?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",180
"181","—Yes",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",181
"182","46282. The herring have never left it yet?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",182
"183","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",183
"184","46283. Is there any likelihood or fear that they will ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",184
"185","—No, so far as we can judge.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",185
"186","46284. What are the limits within which you fish in Loch Fyne?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",186
"187","—We fish from Campbeltown up to the head of Upper Loch Fyne. We are not restricted to any certain portion.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",187
"188","46285. Where is your chief fishing ground ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",188
"189","—From Campbeltown to Ardrishaig.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",189
"190","46286. The boats you use are not so large as those used at Wick and on the east coast generally ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",190
"191","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",191
"192","46287. Will you mention exactly what their distinctive character is in comparison with the east coast boats ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",192
"193","—The boats we use run from twentyfour to twenty-six feet keel, and we find they are quite large enough for the trawl fishing here, because larger boats could not be handled with oars.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",193
"194","46288. You make great use of oars instead of sail ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",194
"195","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",195
"196","46289. Have your men sometimes to pull for hours without raising a sail ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",196
"197","—-Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",197
"198","46290. Is it not a characteristic of the fishing ground and coast here, as distinguished from the northern and east coasts, that you are more sheltered ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",198
"199","—Yes, we are more sheltered in Loch Fyne.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",199
"200","46291. That gives you a great advantage over the inhabitants of the north-west Highlands ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",200
"201","—Yes; the loch is more sheltered and safer.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",201
"202","46292. It makes it possible for you to fish always, except when there is a storm ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",202
"203","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",203
"204","46293. I suppose you know there is a very great difference in that respect in the coasts of Skye, Shetland, Barra, and these places ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",204
"205","—Yes, these places are far more exposed. We could not prosecute the herring fishing away north with the trawl. It is quite a different system from the drift net.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",205
"206","46294. Do you think the trawl fishing could not be carried on profitably there, as it is here?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",206
"207","—No, not in the ocean.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",207
"208","46295. Why?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",208
"209","—Because our boats would be too small, and we could not work the trawl with large ones.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",209
"210","46296. What kind of boats do you consider best for trawling ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",210
"211","—These boats that we have got here, about twenty-six feet keel and eight or nine feet beam.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",211
"212","46297. A big heavy one would not be suitable?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",212
"213","—No, it would not be suitable at all.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",213
"214","46298. Why ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",214
"215","—We could not manage it with oars, and it is with oars principally that we work.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",215
"216","46299. Then the only other alternative is a steamer ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",216
"217","—A steamer.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",217
"218","46300. Which they use in the Firth of Forth with great profit?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",218
"219","—Yes. The trawl may through time come to be worked by steamers.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",219
"220","46301. Could a small boat work with a big one, trawling in the open sea ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",220
"221","—It might, but the weather would require to be steady and calm.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",221
"222","46302. Is the condition of most of the inhabitants of Tarbert comfortable as compared, for instance, with that of the people of Skye and the Lewis and the west coast of Ross-shire?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",222
"223","—Yes, they are very comfortable.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",223
"224","46303. They are well-to-do ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",224
"225","—Yes, they are well-to-do.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",225
"226","46304. Are there any of the fishermen who are poor and in debt and in bad circumstances, owing to causes over which they have no control ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",226
"227","—Not that I am aware of. If they are they have no cause to be, because the fishing has been very good these five or six years back.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",227
"228","46305. There has never been any destitution here?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",228
"229","—Yes, in former years.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",229
"230","46306. How long since ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",230
"231","—About six years back, there were very few fish to be got in Loch Fyne, and most of the fishermen had to go away north. There were plenty of herrings in the loch that year, but they could not be caught. They were lying out in the deep. ",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",231
"232","46307. Did that cause much distress among the population ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",232
"233","—Yes, for that year.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",233
"234","46308. But it never approached to positive want or scarcity of food?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",234
"235","—It did not exactly come to that, but it was very severe for that year.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",235
"236","46309. Originally the population here, like those on the rest of the west coast, were occupying land as crofters or cottars, fishing occasionally?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",236
"237","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",237
"238","46310. When did that cease? Has it come about gradually, or did it happen at any particular period ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",238
"239","—There is another of the delegates to speak, and he has more experience and knowledge of that than I have,",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",239
"240","being an older man than I am.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",240
"241","46311. Has everybody here a kail-yard, at least?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",241
"242","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",242
"243","46312. Are there some without a bit of ground at all?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",243
"244","—Yes, most of the people in Tarbert are without any land at all.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",244
"245","46313. But they manage to live quite comfortably notwithstanding?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",245
"246","—Yes, these four years back, anyway.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",246
"247","46314. Have any of them got a cow ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",247
"248","—There are a few about the village who have got a cow—say ten or fifteen fishermen.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",248
"249","46315. Is the supply of milk good?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",249
"250","—Well, it is very scarce —at least there is not a sufficient supply for the people of the village.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",250
"251","46316. Where is it supplied from?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",251
"252","—It comes from about four miles from here, and a farm about two miles away, but there is not a sufficient supply of milk for the village.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",252
"253","46317. What is the number of boats here?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",253
"254","—There are sixty-seven trawling skiffs.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",254
"255","46318. Are these generally the property of more than one man?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",255
"256","—Yes, they are always between four men. Each boat has four men, and each man has a share of both boat and nets.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",256
"257","46319. But they all belong to themselves?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",257
"258","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",258
"259","46320. They never have to work for fish-curers ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",259
"260","—-No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",260
"261","46321. What is the cost of an average boat without its nets ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",261
"262","—Between £60 and £70.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",262
"263","46322. And a complete set of nets or trawls ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",263
"264","—About £35 or £40 ; say £35.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",264
"265","46323. Your boats are made here?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",265
"266","—Yes, they are built here.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",266
"267","46324. The Chairman.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",267
"268","—You stated that the price of the fish had increased, and that the quantity of the fish procured had increased; what is thought to be about the number of fish that exists ? Are the fish being reduced in number, or do you think they are just as abundant as they ever were at any previous period ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",268
"269","—To my judgment, I think they are as abundant as at any previous period.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",269
"270","46325. They are as abundant, but we have been told that they are differently distributed—that they do not come as high up the loch as they used to do ; is that so ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",270
"271","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",271
"272","46326. Is it observed that they are gradually getting further and further down towards the deep water, or are they stationary now ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",272
"273","—Well, they have taken an upward course these fours years back. They have been stationary about two miles from this harbour. Most of the fish were lying at the mouth of Upper Loch Fyne last year.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",273
"274","46327. Then you think the fish are beginning to go higher up again ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",274
"275","—Yes, that is our experience of it these four years back.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",275
"276","46328. That formerly they were higher, and then they fell back, and  now they are going up again ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",276
"277","—Yes, they are going up again. ",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",277
"278","46329. So there is no apprehension that the fish are going to leave the loch and gradually get outside or lower down ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",278
"279","—No. ",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",279
"280","46330. About how long has the winter fishing on the Ayrshire coast been prosecuted; how long have they been in the habit of going there ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",280
"281","—About thirty years.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",281
"282","46331. At what period of the year is that ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",282
"283","—January, February, and March. They leave the banks of Ballantrae about the beginning of March.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",283
"284","46332. And all the fish caught upon the Ayrshire coast during those months are in a spawning condition ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",284
"285","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",285
"286","46333. Do you think it is a wasteful and abusive system to catch the fish on the spawning beds, or do you think the number of fish and their prolific character is so great that it will never have any effect upon them, whatever quantity you catch?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",286
"287","—Well, the Ballantrae fishing has been prosecuted these six years with great success, and we do not find that the fish are diminishing in the least.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",287
"288","46334. You do not find either that there are fewer fish in Loch Fyne or fewer fish on the spawning beds ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",288
"289","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",289
"290","46335. Then it is not considered that there is any dread or fear that the fish will be diminished by being killed on the spawning beds, or diminished so much as to effect the fishing ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",290
"291","—No, I do not think so, because it has been prosecuted these four or five years back with great success, and the herrings in Loch Fyne are as plentiful as they were previous to that.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",291
"292","46336. Still, four or five years is not a very long time to judge by ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",292
"293","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",293
"294","46337. In catching the fish on the spawning beds, are there a great number of the fish destroyed and wasted, or are all those that are taken taken in such a condition that they can be sent to market ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",294
"295","—All that are fished are sent to market. Most of them are sent to the English market.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",295
"296","46338. There are not many thrown into the sea ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",296
"297","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",297
"298","46339. Are not fish a great deal more delicate at that time, and apt to be injured and fall to pieces ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",298
"299","—-Yes, but they are very speedily got tomarket.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",299
"300","46340. Are they just lightly salted and sent as it were fresh to market ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",300
"301","—Some put salt on them, and others send them away fresh to market.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",301
"302","46341. Quite fresh ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",302
"303","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",303
"304","46342. Do the people here think it is a great advantage to go down for these two months to Ayrshire, or would they rather not go ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",304
"305","—Some of them reap the benefit, and others do not ; but it would be more injurious to the people on the Ayrshire coast than it would be to the Loch Fyne fishermen if it were not prosecuted, because they depend on that fishing principally for a livelihood.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",305
"306","46343. Do they use the same kind of boats that you do here?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",306
"307","—Yes, about the same.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",307
"308","46344. You mentioned that the harbour at Girvan had been improved last year; who gave money to improve it?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",308
"309","—The Railway Company, I believe, and the town's people.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",309
"310","46345. Did they get a loan for that purpose from Government?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",310
"311","—I am not sure.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",311
"312","46346. Was it a very expensive business; did they spend a great deal of money ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",312
"313","—I think, £9000 or £10,000, but I don't remember. Some of the fishermen present will have an idea of the amount that was spent.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",313
"314","46347. When you speak of trawling here, is trawling the same thing that it is upon the east coast ? Is the word used in the same sense ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",314
"315","—It is a different system altogether.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",315
"316","46318. You have none of the instruments or machinery by which they rake the bottom upon the east coast Ì",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",316
"317","—No. ",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",317
"318","46319. Is there any apprehension that steam trawling will be introduced here, and that they- will bring the same description of machinery and contrivances here that they have on the east coast?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",318
"319","—There is no apprehension of that, because the bottom of this coast is quite rocky and rough, and these steam trawls would not work in Loch Fyne. They would tear all their nets; the bottom is quite rough.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",319
"320","46350. But people are very ingenious; do you not think they might contrive something ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",320
"321","—I do not think so. The water is very deep.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",321
"322","46351. Nobody, in fact, has tried steam trawling with machinery here yet ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",322
"323","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",323
"324","46352. When the two boats work together and have one net between them, and when they take the fish out between them on the sea, how do the two boats lie when the fish are being lifted into them? Do they lie close together ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",324
"325","—Yes, there is about a foot between them, and the fish are in between the two boats and they lift the fish into the boats with baskets.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",325
"326","46353. They haul them in by the middle of the side of the boats ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",326
"327","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",327
"328","46354. Then they divide the whole quantity caught between the two boats ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",328
"329","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",329
"330","46355. When they have taken the fish into the two boats where do they fetch them to ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",330
"331","—There are screws at hand ready to take them off to Glasgow.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",331
"332","46356. When they get the fish into the boat what do they put them into ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",332
"333","—Into boxes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",333
"334","46357. And they are just taken on board the screws at once ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",334
"335","—Yes, and there is one thing that we as fishermen desire, and that we petitioned the Fishery Board for, namely, a standard measurement. We wanted to I have a quarter cran brand by Government, so that we might have an imperial measurement for selling our fish. There is not an imperial measurement for selling fish here at all. The buyers have got boxes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",335
"336","46358. Are the boxes sometimes bigger and sometimes smaller?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",336
"337","—Yes; we as fishermen believe that anyhow.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",337
"338","46359. Has there been any imposture practised upon the people in that way ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",338
"339","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",339
"340","46360. So you want to have a box of a standard size?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",340
"341","—Yes, either that or a quarter cran measure —some fixed measurement that we might sell our fish by.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",341
"342","46361. Supposing there was a weekly close time as you mention, and no fishing was allowed between sunset on .Saturday and sunrise on Monday, that would be during all the summer months. Well, they would begin to take the fish on Monday morning at daybreak—about three or tour in the morning ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",342
"343","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",343
"344","46362. Could the fish be got to Glasgow in time for the Glasgow folk to eat them that day ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",344
"345","—Yes, in the morning.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",345
"346","46363. Because the Glasgow people will complain that they cannot get their fish. They won't care perhaps very much about Sunday there, but they want to get their fish. Would you be able to deliver the fish in time",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",346
"347","for dinner on Monday ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",347
"348","—Yes, I believe in time for breakfast.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",348
"349","46364. Suppose you started as early as twelve o'clock on Sunday night, you would have to go out from here by eight or nine o'clock on Sabbath evening ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",349
"350","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",350
"351","46365. You would not like that ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",351
"352","—No ; we would not have that at all.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",352
"353","46366. What o'clock do you think would be the soonest you could start on Monday morning—two or three o'clock?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",353
"354","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",354
"355","46367. And you would be on the ground fishing by four ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",355
"356","—Yes. ",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",356
"357","46368. And the fish would be in Glasgow and in the shops I suppose by two o'clock ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",357
"358","—The steamers go up from Loch Fyne in five hours.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",358
"359","46369. Straight into the river ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",359
"360","—Yes, between Loch Fyne and Glasgow in five hours.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",360
"361","46370. Where do they discharge ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",361
"362","—At the Broomielaw.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",362
"363","46371. How long are the people busy and how long are they idle? The summer fishing will last fully six months ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",363
"364","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",364
"365","46372. The half of May, June, July, August and September, October, and into November ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",365
"366","—Yes, that is the general time.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",366
"367","46373. And then it begins again in January—January, February, and March —may we call it two and a half or three months ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",367
"368","—Two and a half.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",368
"369","46374. That makes eight and a half months ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",369
"370","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",370
"371","46375. And it leaves three and a half months of comparative idleness. Now, how do the people get on during those three months; what do they do?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",371
"372","—Some of them try the long lines over in Jura Sound.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",372
"373","46376. In what months would they go to that long line fishing ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",373
"374","—April. They prosecute it for about a month.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",374
"375","46377. Then November and December are partly idle, and part of April and May; what do they do in the idle spring mouths ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",375
"376","—They get their boats and nets put in order, and prepared tor the next season's fishing.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",376
"377","46378. Is it considered that the work during the eight or nine months when they do work is so hard and exhausting that the people require rest to recruit themselves, or if they had work to do during the idle months,",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",377
"378","would they be able and willing to work all the year round ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",378
"379","—I believe they would be able and willing to work all the year, especially those who had families",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",379
"380","40379. Then you don't think there is anything so hard in a fisherman's life that he requires more rest than other labourers ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",380
"381","—That is the very reason why we as fishermen of Loch Fyne would like to have a weekly close time, so that we would get the rest from Saturday till Monday.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",381
"382","46380. You would rather have your rest every week than have a long period of idleness in the year?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",382
"383","—Yes, for we find we have plenty to do in getting our boats and nets in order for work again.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",383
"384","46381. We have been told with reference to the effect of fishing labour upon the health and strength of the people engaged in it, that there are not very old people among the fishermen in this country—that they don't live very long; what do you think about that? Did you ever hear that remarked ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",384
"385","—No, I think they live to a good age in Tarbert in general.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",385
"386","46382. You think they live as long as other people?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",386
"387","—Yes. ",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",387
"388","46383. But still I have heard from two or three persons capable of judging that you don't see as many old people about here as you do about Skye and the north-west, where the people live half on the water and half",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",388
"389","on shore ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",389
"390","—The reason I would give for that is this, that in former years people had not boats and material in as good order as they have at present, and seeing they are improving in the matter of oilskins and keeping themselves",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",390
"391","dryer than they formerly used to do, that might be a reason why the fishing would affect their health in former times.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",391
"392","46384. They will be older in the future ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",392
"393","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",393
"394","46385. Where do you got your nets ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",394
"395","—We get them from Kilbirnie and Paisley.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",395
"396","46386. Are they made there?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",396
"397","—Yes, and in Campbeltown.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",397
"398","46387. Would it not bo possible to make them here if you bought the materials ? Could not part of the idle time be employed in making nets?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",398
"399","—If there was a net manufactory got up, there is no doubt it would be a great advantage and improvement to the people.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",399
"400","46388. Are the nets made by machinery generally there?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",400
"401","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",401
"402","46389. What short of machinery—steam machinery or water power, or what ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",402
"403","—They are worked by something like weaving —by hand work.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",403
"404","46390. Then the fishing net is made where it is made by hand looms ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",404
"405","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",405
"406","46391. And there is no reason why there should not be a handloom here just as there is elsewhere?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",406
"407","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",407
"408","46392. Do women work these looms, or men?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",408
"409","—Women.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",409
"410","46393. Always ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",410
"411","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",411
"412","46394. Then it would not give the men more labour here, but just the women ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",412
"413","—That is so.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",413
"414","46395. How would they like that if they had not been accustomed to the work ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",414
"415","—I don't know.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",415
"416","46396. Has any proposal ever been made to add the manufacture of nets here to the fishing industry; could not somebody try it ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",416
"417","—It was never proposed or tried.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",417
"418","46397. Are you quite sure there are no steam looms for making nets, or are they all hand ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",418
"419","—They are all hand. I have been in the factory at Campbeltown, and the women work them just something like weaving by hand.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",419
"420","46398. You are sure there is no steam engine about?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",420
"421","—It is by the handloom.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",421
"422","46399. Just like a loom in a cottage?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",422
"423","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",423
"424","46400. Is there any weaving here at all?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",424
"425","—No; there are no weavers in this town at all.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",425
"426","46401. To whom does the land in this place belong?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",426
"427","—To Mr Campbell of Stonefield.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",427
"428","46402. Does Mr Campbell give facilities for feuing?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",428
"429","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",429
"430","46403. Can anybody get a feu who wants it and will pay for it?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",430
"431","—Yes, but they require to pay very dear for it.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",431
"432","46404. How much is it?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",432
"433","—The general run for feuing is 2s. per foot of frontage for a stance with a frontage of forty feet and going ninety feet back.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",433
"434","46405. How much per acre?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",434
"435","—I think it would come to about £48 or so, but I am not sure.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",435
"436","46406. Then there is land to be had for feuing, only you say it is dear ? Has the town been increasing of late years, or is it the same as it has been for a number of years ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",436
"437","—It is increasing. They are building more these few years back.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",437
"438","46407. They are building more, but do they pay a higher price ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",438
"439","—I think it is the same price.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",439
"440","46408. You say the people about Campbeltown and elsewhere come up and fish on Sunday; does that depend at all upon difference of religion ? Is it the Roman Catholics who go up on Sunday, or do Protestants do it too ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",440
"441","—I think the most of them that do it have no religion at all.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",441
"442","46409. But you do not find that the Roman Catholics are worse about that? There are no boats that are manned altogether by Roman Catholics?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",442
"443","—I am not sure with regard to the Campbeltown fishing, but I know there are no Roman Catholics in Tarbert.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",443
"444","46410. It is not a religious question ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",444
"445","—I do not think so.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",445
"446","46411. Not a question between the different churches?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",446
"447","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",447
"448","46412. Just the custom of the place?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",448
"449","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",449
"450","46413. Has any voluntary attempt been made, by representations to the people themselves or to the clergy down there, to try and prevent Sunday fishing ? Have you ever entered into communication with them to try and negotiate a common understanding not to fish ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",450
"451","—Yes, we have tried that at different times.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",451
"452","46414. But you do not find them willing to stop?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",452
"453","—They will not succumb to the rules at all.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",453
"454","46415. Have you found that the clergy down there tried to assist you at all?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",454
"455","—Yes, I believe they have. They used their influence to get the men not to work during the weekly close time.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",455
"456","46416. But it has not succeeded?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",456
"457","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",457
"458","46417. If the people who buy the fish refused to buy fish caught on Sunday there would be no use in fishing; but you don't find that the people who buy the fish have any scruples about it ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",458
"459","—No, they are quite open to take them.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",459
"460","46418. Professor Mackinnon.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",460
"461","—When you said there was considerable destitution six years ago, I suppose you meant that the people were hard up ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",461
"462","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",462
"463","46419. You did not mean that they had to apply to people outside for assistance ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",463
"464","—No.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",464
"465","46420. They were able to live upon their credit till better times came?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",465
"466","—Yes.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",466
"467","46420*. So there was not what we call destitution—there were only harder times ?",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",467
"468","—Yes, only hard times.",745,"Hugh Carmichael","Argyll, Tarbert",468
