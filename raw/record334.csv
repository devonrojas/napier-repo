"1","ANGUS FERGUSON, Cottar and Fisherman, Taransay (48)—examined",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",1
"2","18068. The Chairman.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",2
"3","—How many cottars are there in Taransay?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",3
"4","—Ten families. ",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",4
"5","18069. Were you chosen by these ten families to represent them here?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",5
"6","—Yes.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",6
"7","18070. What do you wish to say on their behalf?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",7
"8","—I wish to speak of the poor condition of the people ever since I first remember them. When I first remember the place my father had a holding there. The third part of the island was under crofts. There were fourteen families upon that portion. These crofts were removed when I was nine years of age, and the island was cleared for John M'Donald. The whole fourteen families were removed from the island in all directions. Some went to the south-west of Harris, some to Lewis, and others elsewhere. My father was allowed to remain by the tacksman in the place where we were when we had a croft, and that accounts for our being in the island. Ever since we lost that land we have not been able to get a holding of land since. We had nothing but to be cottars under the tacksman, and to be dealt with just as he pleased; and the arrangement between him and us, which subsisted while he was in life, was this,—we worked the land for him, and we gave him half the produce. He allowed us to keep a cow and eight sheep. His son succeeded him, and he made a different arrangement with us. We had net cow or sheep since that time. At that time we had to take to the lobster fishing and such work as goes on in the place. This tacksman gave us potato ground to the extent of four or five barrels, upon condition that we would give him in return farm service any day of the year he wished us. And now because we were in a very remote corner of the world, where few advantages could be got, we were obliged to accept these conditions, although we felt them hard. We are not allowed to sow either oats or barley, but only potatoes; and we are obliged to fish the whole year, summer and winter, autumn and spring, in order to enable us to obtain a livelihood, for this amount of potatoes does little to support us. I have been head of a family for the last twenty-six years, and during that time I have neither had cow nor sheep, and I did not earn sixpence on Taransay ever since. I have obtained my livelihood by braving many a danger upon the wild shore through the spring and winter months, where a stranger could scarcely expect that a boat would live.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",8
"9","18071. It is said by some people that the land is not big enough, without the help of fishing, to support all the population, and that it would be desirable to make some of them entirely fishermen. Do you think Taransay is a good station for fishermen ?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",9
"10","—It is a suitable fishing station, but the coast is wild and exposed, and during the winter months it may be two months, and it may be five or six weeks, before a boat could leave the shore.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",10
"11","18072. If they had better boats, with proper landing places, would they be able to fish more regularly ?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",11
"12","—It is only small boats that we have, and the fishing we prosecute does not require heavy boats, neither does the shore upon which we land them. They must be boats of such weight as we can haul ashore.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",12
"13","18073. Do you get any wages from the tacksman for your services, beyond the potato ground ?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",13
"14","—Nothing.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",14
"15","18074. Are you obliged to stop at home to do that service whenever it is called for?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",15
"16","—Well, upon certain days we must remain at home from our own fishing,—such days as when we have to ferry heavy cattle between the shore and the island, and such work as that, that requires people in order to carry it out.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",16
"17","18075. How many days on the average in the year are you employed in Mr Macdonald's service ?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",17
"18","—We work very irregularly—a bit of a day now and a bit of a day again,—but I believe, if they were all strung together, they would make about sixty full days in the year.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",18
"19","18076. Then how many days, broken and unbroken, are you called away from your employment by Mr Macdonald? Will it be twice a week on an average?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",19
"20","—Perhaps some weeks we might be called twice, and others not.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",20
"21","18077. Did you hear Mr Mackenzie say he thought the island would support forty families paying a rent of £5 each?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",21
"22","—We had suggested information to that effect to Mr Mackenzie ourselves.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",22
"23","18078. Then you believe forty crofters could afford to pay £5 a piece for it?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",23
"24","—I would think they might be inclined to pay £5 each for it. It would certainly support forty families.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",24
"25","18079. What would you think a fair rent for each?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",25
"26","—I could give no information upon that matter.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",26
"27","18080. What would you yourself be inclined to give for a fortieth share of the island ?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",27
"28","—A fortieth of it would be worth £4 or £ 5 at least.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",28
"29","18081. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",29
"30","—Does Mr Macdonald live on the island ?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",30
"31","—Yes, sometimes. His principal dwelling is at Scaristaveg.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",31
"32","18082. How many farms has he got?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",32
"33","—Two.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",33
"34","18083. What stock has he on Taransay?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",34
"35","—The shepherd can tell; I do not know.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",35
"36","18084. Are there a good number of cows ?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",36
"37","—Yes, there are a lot of cattle.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",37
"38","18085. You have no sheep or cattle?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",38
"39","—No.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",39
"40","18086. Why are you not allowed to keep a cow or a sheep1?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",40
"41","—The will of the tacksman.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",41
"42","18087. Would it do very much injury to the farm if each of the cottars had a cow ?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",42
"43","18088. Where do you get milk?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",43
"44","—We get no milk at all. unless from some of the neighbours when they come ashore from the mainland.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",44
"45","18089. Are all the children of those cottars deprived of milk except what they get from the mainland ?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",45
"46","—They are.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",46
"47","18090. How many children, roughly speaking, may there be among those families of cottars?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",47
"48","—There are seventy-six inhabitants on the island. I do not know the number of children.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",48
"49","18091. And, old and young, they are entirely destitute of milk?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",49
"50","—It is only one of these that has milk— a servant of Taransay.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",50
"51","18092. You say you may work sixty days in the course of the year. Are we to understand and suppose you only get a wage of Is. per day? You pay £3 for the privilege of planting five barrels of potatoes ?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",51
"52","—That is the case, considering the calculation I have made of the days of the week.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",52
"53","18093. Is this labour of sixty days exacted only from the head of the family, or are the women obliged to contribute to it ?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",53
"54","—The head of the family does it, the women do it, and the children do it, accordingly as one is more handy when the work is needed.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",54
"55","18094. But there is only one member of each family bound to do it?",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",55
"56","—Only one.",334,"Angus Ferguson","Harris, Tarbert",56
