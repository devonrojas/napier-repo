"1","Rev. JAMES BARCLAY (80)—examined.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",1
"2","18941. Sheriff Nicolson.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",2
"3","—You are parish minister of Mid Yell?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",3
"4","—Yes, it was a double parish originally, but South Yell was disunited from it recently.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",4
"5","18942. Do you belong to a family of this country?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",5
"6","—Yes.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",6
"7","18943. Are you a native of Shetland?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",7
"8","—I am.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",8
"9","18944. How long have you been minister of the parish?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",9
"10","—Since 1844.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",10
"11","18945. Where were you before that?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",11
"12","—I had no parish before that.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",12
"13","18946. Is there much change in the condition of the people since you came here?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",13
"14","—A very great change.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",14
"15","18947. Is it for the better or the worse?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",15
"16","—For the better; very much for the better.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",16
"17","18948. Would you be so good as to state in what respect?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",17
"18","—In respect of the circumstances of the people generally. For instance, there was no work of much consequence here when I came, with the exception of fishing, but now the people have work at their doors. Formerly you could get a girl to work for you at 6d. a day; now you cannot get them under Is. 6d., or 2½d. an hour. That is so far an improvement in their circumstances. Their buildings are also improved.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",18
"19","18949. What are the wages of a man?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",19
"20","—When I came here 10d. to Is. a day, and I am now paying myself as high as 2s. 6d. for boys, and 5s. for a mason.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",20
"21","18590. And is there more work for them now than there was?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",21
"22","—A great deal.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",22
"23","18951. Of what kind?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",23
"24","—Almost every kind. This herring fishing gives every one a chance of employment—boys and girls and men and women. They are all employed; whereas formerly there was very little work. Although there was herring fishing then, they could not afford, and did not come to anything like the wages they are giving now.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",24
"25","18952. Is there work to any considerable extent going on in connection with the land?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",25
"26","—Not much in connection with land. You see they are both crofters and fishermen combined, and at one season of the year there is very little done on the land.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",26
"27","18953. Are there any large farms in this parish?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",27
"28","—Not very large. The largest farm I know is in West Sandwick.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",28
"29","18954. What is the extent of it—what rent?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",29
"30","—I could not mention the rent exactly; it is £100 odds, I think.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",30
"31","18955. Is the most of the land occupied by crofters?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",31
"32","—Yes, the most of the land; but there is a good deal of land unoccupied—in sheep farms As nearly as I can calculate, there are about 300 odd merks of land occupied by sheep; of course, that reduces the number of the inhabitants very much. ",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",32
"33","18956. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",33
"34","—And how much by crofters'?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",34
"35","—I do not know where the crofters who used to live here are.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",35
"36","18957. Sheriff Nicolson.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",36
"37","—Has there been much change in that respect since you came?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",37
"38","—Yes, a great deal.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",38
"39","18958. Has part of the ground been put into sheep pasture and taken from small tenants?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",39
"40","—A great deal.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",40
"41","18959. Have any of the small tenants been removed out of the parish to make way for sheep farms?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",41
"42","—Not, I think, in this parish —not many. I do not know about North Yell.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",42
"43","18960. But some of them have been deprived of some of their pasture in order to increase the pasture of sheep farms?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",43
"44","—They have, and I think that is a great injury that is at the bottom of the discontent, and it is very natural that it should be.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",44
"45","18961. Has it led to much discontent in this parish? ",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",45
"46","—Not so much in this parish as in the neighbouring parishes. There has been a good deal of common taken from the people in this immediate neighbourhood, but then it is enclosed, and they get the benefit of it, so that you cannot say that is a hardship; I rather think it is favourable to them.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",46
"47","18962. Is part of the scathold fenced?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",47
"48","—Yes, I think so. It keeps out outsiders, and they get the benefit.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",48
"49","18963. Is there any considerable number of small tenants in this parish who are able to live upon their crofts, independent of any other occupation?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",49
"50","—No, I know of none. If they were to take larger farms, and had fixity of tenure, they might do it; but they have many other ways of providing for themselves—their cattle, and sheep, and ponies, and the fishery—and they take them all combined.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",50
"51","18964. Is their condition generally in this parish comfortable, or the reverse?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",51
"52","—I should say very comfortable.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",52
"53","18965. There is never anything approaching destitution?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",53
"54","—Not since 1847 and 1848, when the potato failure was.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",54
"55","18966. In respect to clothing, do you think they are better off than they used to be?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",55
"56","—Yes, they are more fashionably clothed, at any rate.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",56
"57","18967. Are the children generally well clothed?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",57
"58","—Generally; perhaps they require a little more attention to be paid to them.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",58
"59","18968. Are there any children so poorly clothed as to make it a reason for their not attending school?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",59
"60","—I suppose they will put in that as one reason.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",60
"61","18969. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",61
"62","—Or the church?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",62
"63","—Yes, 1 cannot complain of want of clothing of the people. The fact is that in these forty years a complete change has taken place among the people both as to food and clothing, and in every respect. But, so far as I can see, the crofters and landlords are living in perfect cordiality and peace. I do not think myself they require anything, unless it be fixity of tenure or leases, and that the forty days' notice to quit be altered; that is a terrible hardship. I do not see how the crofter can possibly improve the place if he has no fixity of tenure.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",63
"64","18970. Mr Cameron.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",64
"65","—You mean by fixity of tenure security of lease?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",65
"66","—Yes.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",66
"67","18971. You don't mean fixity of tenure?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",67
"68","—No.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",68
"69","18972. Sheriff Nicolson.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",69
"70","—Some have leases?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",70
"71","—Yes.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",71
"72","18973. Any considerable number?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",72
"73","—-No, you will hear crofters complaining of their rent being too high, but they forget that, at the same",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",73
"74","time, the profits have increased to three times the amount In regard to the cattle, in 1844 I could purchase a cow for 35s. or 40s.—a native cow, a farrow cow—and a calf at £3. This year you could not get the same class of cattle under £5 or even £7. The rents have not risen to that extent; so that, looking at it from a purely commercial point of view, the people are the gainers.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",74
"75","18974. Are there no cottars at all?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",75
"76","—No, I don't exactly know the meaning of that.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",76
"77","18975. A cottar is a working man with a house and a bit of land sufficient to raise a few potatoes and a little corn?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",77
"78","—There are very few of these. We have a good many small places of that sort; we call them  housewives, those who are on the poors roll, but that is the only class of cottars I know of. You will see yourselves round here that the houses are very good for fishermen. These houses have been newly built. No doubt, a great many of the people require better houses; but they don't provide them themselves; the landlord provides the houses.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",78
"79","18976. Have there been a good many new cottages built?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",79
"80","—Oh, yes, a good many.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",80
"81","18977. Good slated houses?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",81
"82","—Not many slated houses except here, about Mid Yell. In the country generally they are thatched houses. They are now getting felt roofs.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",82
"83","18978. Are these found as satisfactory as slate?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",83
"84","—I should think not.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",84
"85","18979. Or as thatch?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",85
"86","—It is better than thatch.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",86
"87","18980. Does the custom still prevail of having the fire in the centre of the house?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",87
"88","—Oh, yes.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",88
"89","18981. Is it generally the case?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",89
"90","—In the old houses; but when they get new houses they use chimneys.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",90
"91","18982. Are there any houses in this parish in which the cattle are accommodated under the same roof with the family?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",91
"92","—Not now.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",92
"93","18983. But they used to be so?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",93
"94","—Oh, yes; people thought it was very warm and comfortable and healthy.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",94
"95","18984. Have they improved in the tidiness of their habits about their houses?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",95
"96","—They are improving; it will take some time to do that.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",96
"97","18985. In respect of education, do you think it has made great advances?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",97
"98","—There cannot be much; until the Education Act was passed there was only one school in the double parish.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",98
"99","18986. Then the people in a great part of the parish were without education?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",99
"100","—They educated themselves. There was generally some lad went about; and they seemed to be more anxious about schools then than they are now.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",100
"101","18987. I suppose they complain of the taxation?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",101
"102","—It is very heavy.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",102
"103","18988. What is the rate in this parish?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",103
"104","—The school rate and poor rate are 6s. 6d. between them—half on the tenant and half on the landlord; and then, adding other taxes, it comes very hard.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",104
"105","18989. How many schools are there in the parish now?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",105
"106","—Six board schools. You see the population is scattered round about the shores—there is no interior population—only along the coast; and you must have schools within three miles of each other, and it is a very heavy burden.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",106
"107","18990. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",107
"108","—You said there were not many people removing from your parish, or giving way to sheep farms, but that there was such in neighbouring parishes?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",108
"109","—Yes.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",109
"110","18991. Mention the neighbouring parishes?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",110
"111","—I can only mention what takes place in my own districtNorth Yell and Fetlar.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",111
"112","18992. Any more ?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",112
"113","—I don't know.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",113
"114","18993. And Unst?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",114
"115","—Yes. ",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",115
"116","18994. You mentioned that some people had leases here?-",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",116
"117","—- There are a few of them. ",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",117
"118","18995. I presume on all bigger farms like West Sandwick the tenant has a lease?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",118
"119","—I think they have. ",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",119
"120","18996. Would anybody improve his land unless he had a lease or some hold?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",120
"121","—I think not.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",121
"122","18997. You would not be disposed to do so yourself?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",122
"123","—No; I would not. A man who has no security may be turned off on forty days' notice. It would take sometime before they would pay up the improvements.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",123
"124","18998. You have stated that the condition of the people generally has improved within your own observation?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",124
"125","—Yes.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",125
"126","18999. Do you think that several of them, if they got the opportunity of enlarging their crofts, and had a little more security in their position, would be disposed to improve?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",126
"127","—I think many of them would.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",127
"128","19000. For instance, to-day we had a walk in this immediate neighbourhood, and the fields are very dirty and full of weeds—most slovenly—can you make any excuse for people tilling in that way?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",128
"129","—The combination of fishing and crofts—the one spoils the other. They give more attention to what pays them best.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",129
"130","19001. You stated that a good deal of improvement and progress have been made within your recollection; is that progress and comparative comfort of the people entirely owing to the development of the fishings rather than to anything done in improving the land or the facilities",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",130
"131","afforded them?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",131
"132","—It is only of late that the fishings have increased.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",132
"133","19002. But before then were the circumstances of the people improved?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",133
"134","—Yes, they were greatly improved.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",134
"135","19003. But not so rapidly?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",135
"136","—Oh, dear, no. During the last five or six years a great improvement has taken place in the circumstances of the people.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",136
"137","19004. Do you think some of them have been laying by any money?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",137
"138","—I am sure I cannot say. I suppose they would.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",138
"139","19004*. I am only putting that question with regard to the desire for more land and bigger crofts,—that they would be able to stock them?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",139
"140","—I think they would.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",140
"141","19005. You stated that a cow a good number of years ago would cost 35s. to 40s., and that now it would cost something like £6 or £7. Now would one of these small crofters be able to rear an animal that would bring that price at the present day?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",141
"142","—I should think so. I have a small property of my own, and I have some tenants and crofters on the glebe lands, and one crofter can pay me £5 odd, and raise fourteen head of these cattle,",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",142
"143","19006. Have you seen him do so?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",143
"144","—I have.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",144
"145","19007. Should not a man like that rather be encouraged?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",145
"146","—Surely.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",146
"147","19008. Would they not really form the wealth of the country?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",147
"148","—Surely; but it is rarely you get such an active man.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",148
"149","19009. But when you have such a man he ought to get encouragement?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",149
"150","—Certainly.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",150
"151","19010. And I hope you encourage him by not raising his rent?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",151
"152","—No. not in that way. He has three farms close together.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",152
"153","19011. The Chairman.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",153
"154","—You mentioned that every class of people found employment and advantage in the fishery?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",154
"155","—Yes.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",155
"156","19012. The women and younger people among others?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",156
"157","—Quite so.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",157
"158","19013. Are you speaking of the women belonging to the locality, or do the fish-curers import labour from other places?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",158
"159","—They have been obliged to import labour through the scarcity of gutters.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",159
"160","19014. Where do they hire that class of women?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",160
"161","—At various places in the north of Scotland—Peterhead, Aberdeen, Inverness; and indeed they have come from as far as Argyleshire.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",161
"162","19015. When they bring them over here, do they bring them in gangs?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",162
"163","—In considerable numbers; it depends on the number of the fishing boats they have.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",163
"164","19016. Do they make a proper provision for their lodging and entertainment here?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",164
"165","—The best they can. Here, in this place, they have built wooden houses for them.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",165
"166","19017. Is that sort of trade under any inspection or regulation?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",166
"167","—Not that I am aware of; it is only of late that has begun here.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",167
"168","19018. Do you think there is a proper sort of lodging provided for them?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",168
"169","—Generally these houses are put up quickly, and they all have stoves in them to enable them to do the necessary work. I hear no complaint.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",169
"170","19019. You have not heard any complaint of irregularity or immorality?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",170
"171","—I think the people have been very quiet. This is the first time we have had these strangers, and they appear quiet and decent people. I have heard no complaint of any of them, so far as I could learn.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",171
"172","19020. Are they decently dressed?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",172
"173","—Yes.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",173
"174","19021. Do they go to church?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",174
"175","—Some of them.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",175
"176","19022. Are there men brought as well as women?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",176
"177","—Lads are attached to the boats; each boat has about six men and a boy.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",177
"178","19023. Is there any drinking amongst that class of people?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",178
"179","—A good deal, I suspect.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",179
"180","19024. Any among the women?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",180
"181","—I cannot say; I have not heard of any. In various places in Unst all the public-houses stopped for a certain time. They stopped selling any spirits during the fishing season in Delting and various other places.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",181
"182","19025. But there is nothing like an outburst of intemperance?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",182
"183","—No.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",183
"184","19026. You mentioned that the union of fishing and crofting had a bad effect upon the cultivation—in producing a slovenly sort of cultivation. Do you think it would be advisable or advantageous to divide the two classes or not?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",184
"185","—I am sure I cannot say.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",185
"186","19027. I mean, do you think it would be better to give the crofters their crofts and to place the fisherman in habitations apart without any interest in the land; or do you think that a portion of land is essential. to the fisherman?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",186
"187","—It is essential, I think, in the present state of matters. They require milk and cattle.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",187
"188","19028. Have you heard this question discussed or considered?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",188
"189","—No, I have heard it mentioned, but not discussed, and I do not see very well how they could do without land.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",189
"190","19029. Is there any other statement you would like to make spontaneously about the people?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",190
"191","—No, I cannot say there is. I think myself, generally speaking, the people in this parish have no great cause of complaint. Their rents, no doubt, have been raised, but the produce of their farms has been raised —cattle, sheep, and ponies. When I came here eggs were selling at l½d. a dozen, and now they are selling at 6d. You could get a capital lamb then for 2s., and now it would cost you 5s. I have seen a lamb sold for Is.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",191
"192","19030. Mr Cameron.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",192
"193","—What do sheep sell for?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",193
"194","—You will get a real. Shetland sheep of good size for 10s.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",194
"195","19031. What age?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",195
"196","—Three or four or five years old.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",196
"197","19032. What will it weigh?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",197
"198","—40 lbs.; and you would have got the same kind of sheep for 5s. or 6s. before. But there is a good deal of mixture in the sheep now.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",198
"199","19033. Do the sheep vary according to market prices going for sheep in the south, or does the price remain pretty much the same?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",199
"200","— It remains pretty much the same",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",200
"201","19034. At what time do they sell the sheep?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",201
"202","—The month of August or now. ",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",202
"203","19035. Do you know anybody who has sold this year?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",203
"204","—No. ",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",204
"205","19036. Where do they sell them?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",205
"206","—I do not know.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",206
"207","19037. Are there markets here?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",207
"208","—No.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",208
"209","19038. Who buys them—do dealers come round?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",209
"210","—No; for instance, if I want a sheep, I go to purchase it.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",210
"211","19039. But there are 5000 sheep?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",211
"212","—That is a different thing.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",212
"213","19040. Does anybody buy them from outside?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",213
"214","—Yes, they go down to Lerwick.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",214
"215","19041. Does the price in Scotland regulate that price here to any degree?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",215
"216","—I do not think it; not so far as I know.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",216
"217","19042. Have you any idea what the population was about forty years ago in your parish?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",217
"218","—Between 1700 and 1800.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",218
"219","19043. And. what is it now?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",219
"220","—Nearly 1900.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",220
"221","19044. It is rather greater?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",221
"222","—Yes.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",222
"223","19045. Do you think that the land would sustain a larger population than that?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",223
"224","—Yes, I think it would. I think if you take into consideration the number of merks of land that used to be under cultivation, say, 300 odd merks, and give a population of five to each farm, you would bring up the population to about 2300.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",224
"225","19046. Your part of the parish is not overcrowded?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",225
"226","—No, it is not",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",226
"227","19047. How do you account;for the heavy local taxation in Shetland?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",227
"228","—It is very difficult to say.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",228
"229","19048. Have you ever heard any reason assigned?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",229
"230","—Many reasons; but I could not venture to state what the cause of it is. The poor rate and school rate are very high —6s. 6d. in pound.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",230
"231","19049. It appears to be a general rate in the island?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",231
"232","—I suppose so.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",232
"233","19050. Has anybody ever tried to find out the reason?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",233
"234","—There is no apparent cause. There is no greater poverty here than in the Highlands, where the rate is not so high",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",234
"235","19051. How do you account for it?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",235
"236","—It is easy to account for the school rate; and there is one reason, for instance, for the poor rate being high, and that is the number of lunatics we have to support.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",236
"237","19052. Has the number of widows, in consequence of the dangerous life the men lead, anything to do with it?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",237
"238","—To a certain degree, but not much.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",238
"239","19053. Is there any poorhouse in the parish?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",239
"240","—No.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",240
"241","19054. Has that anything to do with it?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",241
"242","—Yes, a good deal.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",242
"243","19055. Do many of the young women go south for employment?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",243
"244","—Yes, a good many, as servant girls.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",244
"245","19056. Do they do well in the south, so far as you know?",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",245
"246","—Yes, I have known some of them do very well, while others did not.",342,"Rev James Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",246
