"1","DONALD MACRAE, Crofter, Cosaig (73)—examined.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",1
"2","32246. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",2
"3","—Who is there at Cosaig besides yourself?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",3
"4","—Six families.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",4
"5","32247. Did they agree to send you here?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",5
"6","—Yes.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",6
"7","32248. All of them?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",7
"8","—Yes.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",8
"9","32249. What did they wish you to say?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",9
"10","—They all wish for more arable land and more hill pasture than they have—room for a reasonable stock of cattle. Most of them have not but one acre of land and one cow; and the half of them have not an acre itself nor cow itself.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",10
"11","32250. There are six of them, and three have not half an acre of land, and two of them have an acre each?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",11
"12","—Yes.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",12
"13","32251. And you have five acres?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",13
"14","—No.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",14
"15","32252. You pay £7 of rent?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",15
"16","—No; that is another Donald Macrae who pays that.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",16
"17","32253. Is there land to be got near you?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",17
"18","—Plenty.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",18
"19","32254. On Eilanreoch?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",19
"20","—Yes; the hill. The hill belongs to Eilanreoch. But I have seen the whole of Cosaig belong to the crofters who were in Kirkton and Cosaig. ",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",20
"21","32255. When did they lose it?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",21
"22","—It is a long time since they lost the first part of it —more than forty years ago ",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",22
"23","32256. Do you remember that?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",23
"24","—I do; it was old Currie who was factor at that time.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",24
"25","32257. And when did they lose the lease of it?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",25
"26","—They took the first portion off that was right opposite the house of Eilanreoch, and Currie said every person would be asking that portion. Then they shut up the fence there. What was down the other side of the fence they had for a good while afterwards. Then a man of the name oft Stewart came, and the fence by this time began to break down, so that the stock upon either side crossed. To make a short story of it, the march was afterwards changed to the back of our house.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",26
"27","32258. Was any alteration made in the rent when the march was changed?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",27
"28","—Yes; the people came to poverty, and the proprietor was obliged to send them to America. Four hundred went away in one day. The land became desolate —no person there. A few did not go away.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",28
"29","The land was charged at £2 an acre, and that rent was put on the few who remained.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",29
"30","32259. Are they paying £ 2 an acre at Cosaig?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",30
"31","—No.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",31
"32","32260. I was asking about Cosaig. When the march was changed at Cosaig, was the rent changed?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",32
"33","—Yes, rent was paid.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",33
"34","32261. What reduction did they get?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",34
"35","—It came down to 25s. per acre the dearest of it.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",35
"36","32262. Have you any place for your cow outside your croft?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",36
"37","—No, not an inch.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",37
"38","32263. You have nothing but arable land?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",38
"39","—No.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",39
"40","32264. And you are paying 25s. an acre for the best of it?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",40
"41","—Yes.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",41
"42","32265. Are they paying less than that for some of it?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",42
"43","— I heard that some had it for £ 1 , but I am not certain.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",43
"44","32266. And you now want more pasture land?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",44
"45","—Yes, we want both pasture land for stock and arable land to support our families.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",45
"46","32267. Who has the arable land now which you desire to get possession of?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",46
"47","—The land has remained unchanged, but some have a good deal of it and others very little.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",47
"48","32268. And you have not got enough yourself?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",48
"49","—I could do with what I have of arable land if I had the hill pasture, and if I had seen the arable ground fairly distributed amongst those who had none at all. I judge that the poor people have about thirty-two acres of arable land just now, and there is only one horse among them to turn the whole of it.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",49
"50","32269. Do you mean that the six tenants in Cosaig have thirty-two acres?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",50
"51","—No ; but round about between this and Cosaig. I am making one place of it.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",51
"52","32270. How many tenants are there in the place between Kirkton and Cosaig?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",52
"53","—Cosaig is just an angle or corner of this place.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",53
"54","32271. How many families are in the enjoyment of these thirty-two acres? Do you think the thirty-two would be sufficient for them if divided between them in pasture?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",54
"55","—No, that would not suit, because there are a good number of them who have only one acre. They would be better off than they are, but it would not support them.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",55
"56","32272. Who is in possession of the arable land you desire in addition to the thirty-two acres?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",56
"57","—There is an innkeeper in our neighbourhood who has forty or fifty acres; but probably he requires more than an ordinary tenant, because he has to support horses and that; but still less than he has might suffice.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",57
"58","32273. Sheriff Nicolson.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",58
"59","—How long have you been living in Cosaig?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",59
"60","—About ten years.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",60
"61","32274. Where were you before?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",61
"62","—In Kirkton.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",62
"63","32275. Why did you remove?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",63
"64","—That would be a long story to tell",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",64
"65","32276. Tell it as shortly as you can?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",65
"66","—They deprived me of my lot which I had here.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",66
"67","32277. Who did?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",67
"68","—I don't mean to blame the proprietor or the factor for it. There happened to be a lawyer of the name of Home, manager of the property for Mr Baillie of Bristol. There were a lot of us gathered together, and we were discussing the proprietors and managers and that; and I happened to say there was no better stock of landed proprietors in the country side than the Baillies, only they had very bad horns. Mr Home heard this in Edinburgh, and resolved to put me out of the house and land. It was a very good lot which I had.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",68
"69","32278. Did you use that expression in Gaelic or English?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",69
"70","—In Gaelic. Mr Stavert was local factor at the time, and Mr Stavert would execute any commission you would entrust him with. A printed paper was set before us that we were paying rent, and containing a considerable number of articles which we were obliged to sign, otherwise we Would have to go out of our lots. One of the articles was that if a son of mine married, he would not be allowed to bring his wife into my house; and if a daughter married, she would not be allowed to bring her husband. I was not to be allowed to cut sea-ware or peat without the consent of the factor, nor to keep a dog, and lots of other rules of the same kind. I went away without signing the paper, and the ground officer came next day and asked why I ran away without signing that paper the previous evening; and he said that unless I signed it I would have to go out of my lot. Through fear I went and signed it. It was about that time that I was discussing proprietors and factors, and it was then I made use of the expression regarding Mr Home.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",70
"71","32279. How long was it after that that you were put out of your croft?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",71
"72","—Two years after that.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",72
"73","32280. What was the reason given for removing you?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",73
"74","—He gave no reason except that he would not suffer me to remain upon the estate.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",74
"75","32281. Did he say that to you or to any other body?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",75
"76","—I never saw the man, but I knew what was coming.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",76
"77","32282. How long had you been here before you were removed?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",77
"78","—Thirty-two years whatever.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",78
"79","32283. Had you always paid your rent?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",79
"80","—Yes ; I never slept one night in arrears.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",80
"81","32284. Did any one ever complain of you to the factor or anybody else for anything wrong you had done?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",81
"82","—I never heard.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",82
"83","32285. What condition were you in when you were removed here?  Were you well off? ",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",83
"84","—I had a house and three cows.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",84
"85","32286. How many sheep?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",85
"86","—I was twenty years in the service of Mr Baillie—old Baillie—in charge of the people working at the district roads, bringing in their time and getting money to pay the men.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",86
"87","32287. How many cows do you keep now?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",87
"88","— Only one.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",88
"89","32288. And no horse?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",89
"90","—No horse. We are at the mercy of the gentle folks in spring, if they will be good enough to give us a horse ; and if not, in the case of an old man like myself, the land will have to lie waste.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",90
"91","32289. Were your father and grandfather here before you?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",91
"92","—Yes.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",92
"93","32290. Have you seen many people removed in your time?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",93
"94","—Yes, I have. I have seen that great big glen, from top to bottom, full of people.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",94
"95","32291. How long ago was it?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",95
"96","—Considerably over sixty years ago. ",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",96
"97","32292. How many families were there?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",97
"98","—I could not say. ",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",98
"99","32293. But it was full of people?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",99
"100","—I could give you a number of the townships. The townships there were only small, but they were bigger than they looked, for behind them in the hills there were shielings—a .shieling for every  township—and these stood them well, for they had a place for their stock. And, if this Commission is to raise the people from the low condition into which they have come, it will be by restoring the land to them.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",100
"101","32294. Were these people making their living upon the land?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",101
"102","—Yes.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",102
"103","32295. Were they living independently of fishing and other work?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",103
"104","—They depended upon their stock; there was no fishing, and a stranger throughout the whole district could get food and drink when he came.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",104
"105","32296. Were there not times, after a bad year, when they would be very ill off?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",105
"106","—I don't know of such times ; no doubt, when the price of stock was low, they would be straitened a bit ; but when the prices rose again their stock would restore them into their former condition.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",106
"107","32297. Was there ever a time, that you remember, when they had to appeal to the public for assistance, until the time of the potato failure?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",107
"108","—No, I never heard of it.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",108
"109","32298. Then, where were these people all removed to?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",109
"110","—America, a great many of them ; and some to Australia.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",110
"111","32299. What was done with the land that they lived upon —who got it?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",111
"112","—It was made into bigger lands, and given to the few who remained at home. We petitioned Mr Baillie ; we complained that the land was too dear at £ 2 an acre, and asked that he would give us it at £ 1 an acre, and he granted our request; and of all the lands that were fixed all that time there is none remaining now without change but one, and that is the only lot upon which there is now a horse in the place ; and there might quite as well have been a horse upon all the other lots.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",112
"113","32300. When these people were removed to America and Australia were there some left?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",113
"114","—Yes ; I am here —one that was left.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",114
"115","32301. I am speaking of the ' great glen’—was some of the ground taken from them made into sheep farms?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",115
"116","—The glen is filled with sheep.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",116
"117","32302. Was that done when the people were removed?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",117
"118","—It was done before that. The clearing began at the time of which I spoke, and they were being gradually cleared down and down, township after township, until they reached the glebe. I can give you the names of nine of them, and each of them with its shieling. It was then that the people could live well, and there were heroes in the land. One man was stronger than three of these men here. They have neither the flesh nor bone nor sinews that they had then. The names of the townships were Maolmore, Maoluachdarach, Bolanalin, Cnocfhuin, Ardaun, Abathalhith, Achadahocuirn, Airithcheachan, Toamcluiadain, Gallatar, and Achdain.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",118
"119","32303. Professor Mackinnon.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",119
"120","—Are these uninhabited now?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",120
"121","—Yes, with the exception of shepherds.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",121
"122","32304. What farm do they belong to?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",122
"123","—They are included in Mr Mitchell's farm now j they are included in Rattagan farm.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",123
"124","32305. Did these clearances begin in the time of the M'Leods? ",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",124
"125","—No, in Bruce's time; it was Mr Bruce's factor who commenced the business.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",125
"126","32306. Did Bruce buy the estate from the M'Leods?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",126
"127","—Yes. I have seen Bruce myself.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",127
"128","32307. Where did he belong to?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",128
"129","—England ; and a good proprietor he was, but he had bad servants.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",129
"130","32308. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",130
"131","—Was it the policy of the estate here first to deprive the people of their beasts and to reduce them to poverty afterwards?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",131
"132","—Undoubtedly.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",132
"133","32309. And after reducing them to poverty, that was an excuse for sending them away to America?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",133
"134","—Those who could were obliged, of their own accord, to go away; and those who were not able to go were only able to creep into such small corners as they might until their means failed, and then they had to go away.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",134
"135","32310. Was it through any fault of the people themselves or their actions that they were reduced to poverty and compelled to be expatriated?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",135
"136","—No; if the land had been left with the people there would have been no appearance of poverty. They had horses and cattle and sheep, and they had the fishing of loch and river salmon.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",136
"137","32311. Are the circumstances of the people to-day —as represented to us, being that of considerable poverty —the result of these evictions and clearances?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",137
"138","—I am convinced of it. They have not food as they had; they have not the fleece of the sheep; and their children have no milk. They are fed like skeletons in comparison with those who went before them. I speak nothing but the truth, but it is truth that should be told.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",138
"139","32312. Mr Cameron.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",139
"140","—Do you remember what amount of stock was kept by each of these people?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",140
"141","—It would depend upon the size of the township. They had their milk cows and followers, and they kept a horse and young cattle upon the hill. In the last township whose neck was broken, each tenant had ten milk cows and a horse. The number of sheep would be few ; I cannot tell the number.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",141
"142","32313. How did these people get reduced to poverty? Were they sent away at once, or were they first reduced to poverty and then sent away?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",142
"143","—I remember four—the last of these people. They were first removed to a township across there, opposite the shore —a poor place. One of them is a next door neighbour of my own, a poor crofter. There were two of them sent over to that poor place. The representative of the fourth family is the family now occupying the house upon Mr Macdonald's glebe.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",143
"144","32314. Were the people who went to America so far reduced to poverty that they had no stock when they went, or did they sell their stock before they went?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",144
"145","—The first number that went away were those from the upper portion of the glen. They had their stock, which they sold, and they paid their own passage away.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",145
"146","32315. Did they go of their own will?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",146
"147","—They thought it was a wise thing for them to go away. Six of my own brothers went.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",147
"148","32316. Were they removed out of their places, or did they go of their own accord?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",148
"149","—Some of them had no land. They were shepherds, and they understood from the policy of the estate that it was wiser for them to go away, and so away they went. The last two who went away were only poor crofters.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",149
"150","32317. When you say that the glen was cleared of its people, do you mean that the people were deprived of the land, or that they voluntarily gave it up?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",150
"151","—I mean that they were deprived of it.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",151
"152","32318. Were they in poor circumstances, or were they in possession of cattle when they were deprived of it?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",152
"153","—They were in poor circumstances when they were deprived of their land.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",153
"154","32319. At what period were they well off, and how did their condition change to one of poverty?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",154
"155","—Two of them got a bit of a township (and they are in here to-day), where they have two or three head of cattle, and a few sheep and a horse.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",155
"156","32320. But how did the mass of the people in the big glen change their position from that of prosperity which you described to that of poverty, in which you say they were when they were removed? How did the change come about?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",156
"157","—The reason for their falling from prosperity to poverty is that they lost their land. They did not like being removed; they were for remaining there living upon the produce of their stock, and they became poor and latterly went away.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",157
"158","32321. So that, in point of fact, the people who were in this glen lost first their land, and remained some years on the land without stock and without land?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",158
"159","—That is the way.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",159
"160","32322. How long did they remain in that condition as cottars on the land but not occupying the land, and having no stock?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",160
"161","—I cannot tell very well the number of years. The tacksman who came in let them all remain as cottars upon the farm.",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",161
"162","32323. Do you know how long ago it was when the land was taken from them?",542,"Donald Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",162
