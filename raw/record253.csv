"3","—Were you freely elected by the people of Crowlista?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",3
"4","—Yes.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",4
"5","143S9. Where is Crowlista?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",5
"6","—It is upon the headland, three miles away from here.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",6
"7","14390. Is it a good place for fishing?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",7
"8","—Somewhat good, but only accessible from the middle of spring and during the summer months.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",8
"9","14391. Have you got any pier or landing place ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",9
"10","—No. We have a sort of breastwork which the fish-curer set up, where we can laud when the tide is in.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",10
"11","14392. Is there any good station for making a pier or jetty?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",11

"14","—Yes. ",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",14
"15","14394. How are you off for boats ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",15
"16","—Very good boats.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",16
"17","14395. How did you procure the boats?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",17
"18","—From the curers. None of the people possess any of these large boats. They have small boats with which they fish lobsters.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",18
"19","14396. Were any boats ever given to the fishermen by the late proprietor?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",19
"20","—Never, since I remember.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",20
"21","14397. What character of boats did fish-curers supply? How long and how wide ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",21
"22","—From 30 to 33 feet long by 14 feet broad.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",22
"23","14398. Have they any deck ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",23
"24","—They are half-decked, with a side deck.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",24
"25","14399. How many men go in each of those boats?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",25
"26","—Seven or eight men.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",26
"27","14400. How long is it since this kind of boat was introduced ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",27
"28","—It is not very long since we commenced with these decked boats, but we always worked with boats that were not altogether so large as these.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",28
"29","14401. Are the new boats better and safer than the old ones?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",29
"30","—Yes, I consider them better.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",30
"31","14402. How are you paid by the fish-curers?—Are you paid by the cran ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",31
"32","—The fishing is for cod and ling, and the curer comes as one of the crew and gets a share; that is to say, when there are seven men in a boat the curer gets an eighth, and when there are eight in the boat the curer gets a ninth part.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",32
"33","14403. Who purchases the fish?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",33
"34","—The curer purchases the fish.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",34
"35","14404. Have you got a curing house?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",35
"36","—Yes.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",36
"37","14405. How much should such a boat cost, all found, with masts and apparatus ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",37
"38","—About £80. There is one that perhaps may have cost £120, but the average would be about £80.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",38
"39","14406. Do none of these boats belong to the fishermen themselves?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",39
"40","—No. The small ones do, but not the big ones.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",40
"41","14407. Do you go round to the east coast fishing?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",41
"42","—Yes, everyone that can.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",42
"43","14408. Do you get higher wages and make more money now than you did many years ago at the fishing ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",43
"44","—No ; the payment is according to the amount of fish received. The payment is partially in arrears ; and of late years we have not been so successful as in former years, so that less money is made. The rule is that wages are given to a man, and, in addition to that, Is. per cran of the fish caught.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",44
"45","14409. Are the wages the same as they were when you began first?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",45
"46","—I believe a hired man gets more in wages now than he got twenty years ago.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",46
"47","14410. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",47
"48","—To whom does the boat belong in which you fish ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",48

"50","14411. Do you work as a hired man to Hector Mathieson?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",50
"51","—No, only as one of the crew of the boat.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",51
"52","14412. Do the crew get a boat on loan on payment of one-eighth of the fish ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",52
"53","—Yes.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",53
"54","14413. That is at home?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",54
"55","—Yes.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",55
"56","14414. How do the crew pay for the boat when they are away from home ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",56
"57","—We don't bring the boat to the east coast fishing at all.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",57
"58","14415. Then for how many months in the year do you use this boat ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",58
"59","—From the beginning of spring until about mid-summer.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",59
"60","14416. And the boat is not used at any other time of the year?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",60
"61","—No, it is not used the rest of the year.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",61
"62","14417. What payment do you get from the curer for the cod and ling that belong to yourself ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",62
"63","—A ling counts twice a cod, and the year before last some ling were bought for 1s and some for 10d. That was the rate the year before last. This last season we don't know the price we will get till the time of settlement comes.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",63
"64","14418. When is the time of settlement?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",64
"65","—At Martinmas.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",65
"66","14419. Are you paid in cash at that time?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",66
"67","—No.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",67
"68","14420. What do you get?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",68
"69","—Meal and fishing material, and this year especially we have drawn already more than the account for the fish wilt cover.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",69
"70","14421. Do you ever, in any year, get a sum to your credit, which is paid to you in money ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",70
"71","—Very seldom now, but there were seasons when I commenced first when such was the case.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",71
"72","14422. How long is it since you were first in debt to the curer?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",72
"73","—I never worked for any man in the parish till this year. I used to fish for Mr Smith at Stornoway.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",73
"74","14423. Do you know the price you have to pay for the meal for which you have to settle at Martinmas ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",74
"75","—I cannot tell the price I shall have to pay at Martinmas for the meal I take now from the curer, but I can tell the price of last year's meal.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",75
"76","14424. What was the price of last year's meal?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",76
"77","—They said it was 24s. per boll.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",77
"78","14425. And you leave it to the kindness of the curer to fix the price of the meal and the price of the ling at Martinmas ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",78
"79","—Yes, poverty compels us to do that.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",79
"80","14426. Professor Mackinnon.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",80
"81","—Is the curer taken bound to keep the boat in working order and to supply tackle ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",81
"82","—The curer is bound to keep the boat in working order, but he pays for no share of the fishing material. In the event of the boat being lost, as to who should have to pay for it, I cannot say, but if it were lost through no fault of ours I would consider it hard to have to pay for it myself.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",82
"83","14427. Is the boat insured ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",83
"84","—I am not aware she is.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",84
"85","14428. Was it the same arrangement you had with the Stornoway curer ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",85
"86","—The same arrangement.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",86
"87","14429. Were you getting supplies from Mr Smith in the same way?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",87
"88","—Yes.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",88
"89","14430. Have you anything else to say ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",89
"90","—I have to state that we poor people have been sent to a headland of the sea where it was not worth while to send sheep forty years ago, and that was the reason we were sent there. We were crowded all together upon it. In my father's days there were sixteen crofters there. There are forty houses now. Many of these were sent from the other townships that were cleared—poor people that could not go away to America. Because there was no other place for them, they were hurled in upon that headland. When I open my own door there is no place within the range of my sight except where there are big sheep. There are now so many poor that there are twenty-three crofters in the township who have only one cow each, and not one of them can say it is his own cow after all.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",90
"91","14431. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",91
"92","—What rent does each crofter pay?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",92
"93","—From 15s. to £ 5 each. There may be some lots which are rented higher than that, but these lots are subdivided. There are three crofters upon one lot, where each pays £3.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",93
"94","14432. The Chairman.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",94
"95","—Was it in the time of Sir James Matheson that this township was founded, or was it before his time ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",95
"96","—It was portioned out into lots during Sir James's time, but there were crofters there before. I don't remember it ever being held by a tacksman. We have",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",96
"97","been there ourselves for four generations. ",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",97
"98","14433. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",98
"99","—How many of the forty were brought in from other townships ",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",99
"100","—I believe that over twenty of the present families are the descendants of outsiders that came in within the last forty years.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",100
"101","14434. How many outsiders have gone in in Sir James Matbeson's time?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",101
"102","—About six. Some of them were sub-tenants of other people. But when other two townships were cleared before Sir James got possession of the property, there was a considerable number that came in then. The place was poor before, and then when those who were too poor to be sent to America were added to those, it made them poorer still ",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",102
"103","14435. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",103
"104","—Is it with the cas-chrom you cultivate your land ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",104
"105","—Partially with the cas-chrom and partially with the spade.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",105
"106","14436. We are badly off for peats. They are far off, and there is no road to them. They are two miles away, and it would take two hours to get a cartful. There is no road there.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",106
"107","14437. You never have horses for ploughing?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",107
"108","—There were horses in my father's time, but wheu the people were thrown in upon them the horses had to be sent away.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",108
"109","14438. But I mean you don't hire horses ?",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",109
"110","—No.",253,"Alexander Macdonald","Lewis, Meavaig",110
