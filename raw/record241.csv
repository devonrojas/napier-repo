"70","13467. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",241,"Rev John Mackay","St Kilda, ",70

"87","13475. Then how do you account for the improvement in their circumstances ?",241,"Rev John Mackay","St Kilda, ",87
"88","â€”When the steamers come here, they leave a good deal of money among the people; and again there is another thing, that M'Leod gives a larger price for the kealt. It once sold for 2s. and 2s. 4d. and now they get 3s. ",241,"Rev John Mackay","St Kilda, ",88
"89","13476. Does he take the whole of the rent in that form, or does he take even more than the value of the rent in this kealt ?",241,"Rev John Mackay","St Kilda, ",89
"90","â€”He will take the whole, everything he can get; he will take the whole produce of the island. ",241,"Rev John Mackay","St Kilda, ",90
