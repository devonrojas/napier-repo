"1","JAMES THOMAS SHAW, Farmer, Barr, Mongastell (31)—examined.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",1
"2","36651. The Chairman.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",2
"3","—Do you desire to make any statement with reference to anything that has passed here to-day ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",3
"4","—I wish to make a statement with regard to the four crofters. I took them over along with the farm when I entered three years ago.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",4
"5","36652. Which crofters do you allude to ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",5
"6","—The four crofters at Barr. This man Malcolm M'Lachlan who spoke to-day is not one of those crofters, and is not on the estate. He said I paid the crofters 2s. a day for their work. I give them that when they are working at home. I give them 2s. 6d. when they are away from home. He said they had two cows each and a stirk and calf. They have two stirks and two cows. He said I only give them fifty days' work. I cannot be quite sure how many days' work I give them, but I give them so much that some of my neighbours cannot get them ; they are so much employed by me on the farm. He spoke about their houses. Their houses are good. They are small, but very well made, and they have two apartments in each.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",6
"7","36653. What is the distinction which you draw between employment at home at 2s. and employment away from home at 2s. 6d. ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",7
"8","—When they get work close to their own houses, they can come home at night, and they get their 2s.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",8
"9","36654. And they get 2s. 6d. when they are obliged to pass the night away ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",9
"10","—Yes.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",10
"11","36655. Where do they pass the night; at the farm houses?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",11
"12","—Supposing I take them to another part of the farm, they have to get lodgings wherever they best can.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",12
"13","36656. The farm then is so large that they would not be able to walk home at night from some parts ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",13
"14","—They would, but it would take them a considerable time.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",14
"15","36657. In fact, when they get 2s. 6d. a day do they work longer hours than when they get 2s. ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",15
"16","—No, the same hours. ",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",16
"17","36658. But only in consideration of having to provide lodgings they get an additional sixpence. In giving these wages is that all the wage, or do they get any food ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",17
"18","—They do not get food.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",18
"19","36659. Am I to understand that for an able-bodied man at this time 2s. is the ordinary wage of this part of the country, or do they get less because they are living upon the farm ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",19
"20","—They get the wages they were getting when I entered the farm, that was the agreement with them. I took them over on the same terms.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",20
"21","36660. How long is your lease ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",21
"22","—Four years to run.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",22
"23","36661. But how long was it when you took it over?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",23
"24","—Seven years.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",24
"25","36662. Then they made an engagement in fact that they were not to get any higher wages for seven years'?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",25
"26","—Yes.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",26
"27","36663. Is that disadvantage imposed on them perhaps considered in their rent; is their rent made easier in consideration of the fact that they bind themselves to labour without an increase for seven years—do they get",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",27
"28","any advantage in exchange for this disability ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",28
"29","—No.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",29
"30","36664. I would ask you to consider ; do you think it is quite right to bind working people over to abdicate all chance of an increase of wages for seven years ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",30
"31","—There was no special bargain made with them as to charges, but that they were to be taken on by me on the same terms as I found them there.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",31
"32","36665. What is the rent that they pay ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",32
"33","—£7.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",33
"34","36666. Are you bound in your lease not to exceed that rent, or is it open to you to deal with these people exactly as you like ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",34
"35","—Exactly as I like.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",35
"36","36667. Are you bound towards them not to raise their rent above £7 ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",36
"37","—No.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",37
"38","36668. So they are bound towards you not to get any more wages, but you are not bound to them not to ask any more rent; I do not mean to say you would do it, but you have no obligation not to get any more rent ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",38
"39","—No, I have no obligation.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",39
"40","36669. Are they bound in consideration of their position on the farm to give you any work at particular periods—harvest work ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",40
"41","—There was no special bargain made as to that.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",41
"42","36670. But do you practically exact that description of work from them ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",42
"43","—If they have no other work on hand, I expect them to attend at my work.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",43
"44","36671. At harvest, for instance?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",44
"45","—Well, I have no crop to harvest.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",45
"46","36672. The harvesting then of sheep—at clipping and smearing times—they would be expected to attend then ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",46
"47","—Yes.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",47
"48","36673. Would they get extra wages then, or still 2s. and 2s. 6d. ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",48
"49","—They would get food.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",49
"50","36674. Is it not rather the custom of the country at clipping and smearing times not only to give food but to give something additional in the way of wages ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",50
"51","—If they work extra hours, not otherwise.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",51
"52","36675. If your people work extra hours you would give them additional wages ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",52
"53","—-I would.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",53
"54","36676. I want to understand exactly the terms on which those people are, as it were, turned over to you by the landlord; do you stand in the position of landlord in all respects to them, that you can raise their rent or",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",54
"55","remove them from the land?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",55
"56","—I believe I do.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",56
"57","36677. But you have not done so?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",57
"58","—I have not",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",58
"59","36678. Do you find you get on well with them—that they are contented?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",59
"60","—Yes.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",60
"61","36679. Have they any unusual advantages which compensate them for those low wages by being on the farm or in connection with the farm ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",61
"62","—They have not to go away to other districts to seek for work. ",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",62
"63","36680. You give them very nearly constant employment?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",63
"64","—I have done so. ",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",64
"65","36681. Have you ever employed them because you did not like to see them unemployed—in order to keep them working?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",65
"66","—I have employed them on one occasion rather than send for workmen to another district, for particular work I had to do on two occasions.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",66
"67","36682. Although you might perhaps have employed the other people more advantageously ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",67
"68","—Yes.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",68
"69","36683. Have you employed them in surface drains ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",69
"70","—Sheep, draining, and closed drains.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",70
"71","36684. Have they any sheep ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",71
"72","—No.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",72
"73","36685 Do they ever, besides the cows that they regularly keen, ask for additional grazing from you ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",73
"74","—One of them did.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",74
"75","36686. What is the price which you or any farmer would ask for the privilege of summer grazing for a cow, from a cottar or labourer?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",75
"76","—It depends on the grazing that the cow or animal might be put on, whether low or high ground.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",76
"77","36687. We will suppose the cow went upon the high ground for summer grazing, what would the price be in this part of the country ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",77
"78","—There has been no instance of that in my experience.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",78
"79","36688. Then upon the better pasture or low ground ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",79
"80","—Nor upon the low ground either. This one cottar who had the one beast, I did not charge him anything.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",80
"81","36689. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",81
"82","—If these cottars of yours can find employment at 3s. a day here, would they be prohibited?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",82
"83","—No.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",83
"84","36690. They might go if they liked?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",84
"85","—Yes.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",85
"86","36691. They are not bound to work to you for 2s. if they can get better wages elsewhere ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",86
"87","—No, except at clipping time.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",87
"88","36692. They are bound to work to you then ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",88
"89","—Yes, and lambing time.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",89
"90","36693. The Chairman.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",90
"91","—You have no power to call upon them to work for you whenever you like?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",91
"92","—No.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",92
"93","36694. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",93
"94","—Supposing the price of labour fell, do you feel you would be bound to give them the same wages all through your lease?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",94
"95","—No, I would not consider I was.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",95
"96","36695. If you could get cheaper labour elsewhere?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",96
"97","—Yes.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",97
"98","36696. Do you know why your sub-tenants did not come themselves today?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",98
"99","—No. They were quite at liberty to come.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",99
"100","36697. Do you think they felt themselves at liberty to come?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",100
"101","—I don't see why they should not.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",101
"102","36698. You are on perfectly good terms with them ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",102
"103","—Yes, and always have been.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",103
"104","36699. What is the distance they would have had to come ?",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",104
"105","—Thirteen or fourteen miles.",604,"James Thomas Shaw","Argyll, Lochaline",105
