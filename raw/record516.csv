"4","—Eighteen families paying rent.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",4
"5","30849. What rent are you paying ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",5
"6","—We have recently got an addition of land, and we are paying between us about £200. We have not paid anything of the increase yet for the new land.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",6
"7","30850. Was it hill pasture or arable land you got, or both ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",7
"8","—Both kinds.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",8
"9","30851. Do you expect to be a great deal better off now that you have got more land ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",9
"10","—We expect to be a good deal better if we get it stocked. We got from the proprietor everything we wanted; we are not going to make any complaint; we are satisfied as we are.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",10
"11","30852. That is what the people of Sallachy asked you to say here to-day ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",11

"15","30854. Have there been tenants in Sallachy since you remember ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",15
"16","—There were tenants in Letter before we came to Sallachy, but it was the proprietor who had it in stock when we got it ; we were not the means of removing anybody. It is nearly sixty years now since I came to Sallachy.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",16
"17","30855. And it is a very good place ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",17
"18","—Yes. The place we had at first was pretty good, but the new addition we got is rather bleak land. But",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",18
"19","we expect for all that that it will benefit us, as we were too circumscribed in our former lots.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",19
"20","30856. From what place did you come before ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",20
"21","—Kyle Rhea, in the parish of Kintail.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",21
"22","30857. We have been hearing all over the country that people sixty years ago were better off than they are now; what have you to say about that ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",22
"23","—It is my opinion they would be better to-day were it not for their folly; money is more plentiful amongst the people than it was in my first recollection.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",23
"24","30858. If you compare the condition of the people in Kintail sixty years ago with the condition of the people in Sallachy now, which are the better off ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",24
"25","—There are no people in Kintail to-day ; it is only deer.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",25
"26","30859. The people who were in Kintail when you left sixty years ago ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",26
"27","—Oh ! yes, they were far better ; they had ground, the mountains, which were keeping people alive, and now they are beside the shore.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",27
"28","30860. And although Sallachy is good, Kintail was better ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",28
"29","—Oh I yes, Kintail was better; one man from Kintail was better than half a dozen; that is true.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",29
"30","30861. Have you a school in Sallachy ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",30

"34","30863. Can they all read and write ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",34

"37","—There were no scholars at all at that time.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",37
"38","30865. Are they better clothed now than they were when you were a young man ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",38
"39","—They have too much pride to-day.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",39

"43","—Not so well I was fed on milk and the produce of sheep, goats, cows, and cattle, and fish,",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",43

"48","30870. But surely they have a little butter in Sallachy, where they have good stock ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",48
"49","—We have not got the stock yet, but we expect to get it if we can get help to put the stock in. We are very glad that we have a wealthy proprietor, who can help us when we require it.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",49
"50","30871. Don't the people consume more meal now than they used to do in old times ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",50
"51","—Oh ! yes; six times more. One house will eat more meal than a town used to do.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",51
"52","30872. Is not that a good thing ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",52
"53","—Meal is very good, but not so nourishing as what I was accustomed to.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",53
"54","30873. Sheriff Nicolson.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",54
"55","—Do you think the people lived happier lives when you were young than they do now?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",55
"56","—I believe they were more friendly than they are to-day. Many of them are becoming rascals to-day. The people formerly were more cheery.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",56
"57","30874. Is there more amusement than there used to be amongst them?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",57

"64","—Yes.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",64
"65","30878. They used to be working at the same time as they were telling stories, did they not ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",65
"66","—It is they that would. The old people spent a lot of their time in budding up dykes on the hills.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",66

"73","30882. And do they not use them at all now ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",73
"74","—Very little.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",74
"75","30883. They made all their own blankets ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",75
"76","—Every stitch that they put on.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",76
"77","30884. And do they make any now at all ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",77
"78","—Very little. I believe they will come on; they are coming on a little.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",78
"79","30585. How ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",79
"80","—They get wool cheaper now. Wool was very dear until now. When wool was dear they could buy their clothes cheaper than they could buy the wool. The people were all going to nonsense.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",80
"81","30886. Did they use to make their own shoes ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",81

"83","30887. Every man could make his own shoes ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",83

"85","30888. Was there a good deal of playing on the pipes ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",85
"86","—Plenty of that.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",86
"87","30889. Is there any now ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",87
"88","—Very little, I believe.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",88
"89","30890. Do you think that an improvement ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",89
"90","—Too much vanity is not desirable; moderation in everything is best.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",90
"91","30891. Did there use to be a good deal of folly in consequence of these pipings ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",91
"92","—Sometimes, when they took too much whisky.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",92
"93","30892. But do you think they were worse people than they are now?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",93
"94","—I cannot say; but they were more friendly disposed towards each other —there are more divisions now amongst them.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",94
"95","30893. Were they wilder in their behaviour?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",95

"100","—Yes.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",100
"101","30896. Is there less of that now?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",101
"102","—Yes ; when there was a fight then it was very severe, the men were so strong.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",102
"103","30897. I suppose they did not go to church so much then as now?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",103
"104","—No, no.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",104
"105","30898. Was there a church at all ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",105
"106","—Oh yes, of course.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",106
"107","30899. There was a parish church ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",107
"108","—Yes.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",108
"109","30900. There would be no other church?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",109

"112","—No.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",112
"113","30902. Did they use to play at games on Sunday ",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",113
"114","—No; but they went among their cattle and wandered on the hills.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",114
"115","30903. Do they observe the Sabbath more attentively now ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",115
"116","—They give more honour to the Sabbath now.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",116
"117","30904. Do you think on the whole that they behave themselves better now than when you were young?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",117
"118","—Yes; they pay more regard to the Sabbath especially.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",118
"119","30905. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",119
"120","—As you are an old man, I wish to ask you one or two questions about Kintail. Were you and your predecessors long in Kintail ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",120
"121","—I was born in Kintail, and my forefathers belonged from original times to KintaiL",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",121
"122","30906. Have you ever heard your predecessors speaking about the battle of Sheriffmuir?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",122
"123","—I have.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",123
"124","30907. Did any: of your people go out at that time?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",124
"125","—My father's brother went to Sheriffmuir, and never came home; it was in Prince Charlie's time.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",125
"126","30908. By the population returns there appears a decrease in the parish of Kintail of nearly 500 people in ten years; do you know that?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",126
"127","—It is well known it is so.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",127
"128","30909. Why is that ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",128
"129","—There are more of the Kintail people in Australia and America than in Kintail. They expected to improve their circumstances there. It is the money of the Indies that spoiled these parts first—it increased the rents. When a man comes from the Indies with plenty of money, he does not care but to get plenty of land, and he tries to take it from the poor by increasing the rent —he outbids the poor",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",129
"130","man.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",130

"136","—About fifteen years.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",136
"137","30913. Could the proprietor of Kintail, like Seaforth, muster up a great lot of Macraes to support him in the field now ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",137
"138","—Not the half.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",138
"139","30914. The Chairman.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",139

Did you ever have anything of that kind ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",144

"146","30917. Do you say that from what you have heard recently, or did you hear it long ago ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",146
"147","—I heard long ago that they had a verbal promise, but no written promise.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",147
"148","30918. You say you are eighty-seven years of age, how do you know that?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",148
"149","—My parents knew it.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",149
"150","30919. Have you always had good health ?",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",150
"151","—Always.",516,"Duncan Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",151
