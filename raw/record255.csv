"4","—Yes.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",4
"5","14520. Have you a statement to lay before the Commission?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",5
"6","—Yes. Breasclete, May 1883.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",6
"7","—In answer to the questions that are required, we the tenants have to say that the rent of our town when Sir James Matheson came to the estate was £110; the number of tenants at that time being thirty families, and it has increased to forty-four families, and the rent arose to £122 ; of which five lots were cut out of the grazing pasture which our village had, and was rented, besides the former sum, these five are of the forty-four above mentioned; and besides that, another piece of arable land and grazing was taken from us, which was valued at £7, and that is turned on the rest of the town. And besides that, there is twenty-five having no lots, but squatters among the rest. This is the fourth chamberlain since Sir James Matheson came to the estate, the second one of them, namely, John Munro Mackenzie, was taking from them their cattle for the rent between £1 and £2, which would get at this time between £7 and £8, and that was reducing the mind and stock of the people.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",7
"8","14521. How many people were present when this paper was adopted?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",8
"9","—Almost every one in the place.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",9
"10","14522. Who wrote the paper?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",10
"11","—A native of the place.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",11
"12","14523. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",12
"13","—When was it that the rent was raised from £110 to £122?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",13
"14","—About thirty years ago, when the place was lotted out. In my first recollection there were only thirty families, but when the people were thrown in upon them, they increased. People all got poor after that, and they were huddled together, and it was at that time, thirty years ago, when the place was lotted out, that the rent was raised.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",14
"15","14524. Does the £122 include rates and taxes?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",15
"16","—No, it is exclusive of taxes.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",16
"17","14525. The paper states that 'five lots were cut out of the grazing pasture which our village had.' Who got these five lots?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",17
"18","—Men that were thrown in upon us.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",18
"19","14526. Where did they come from ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",19
"20","—They came out of the place.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",20
"21","14527. There were no outsiders ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",21
"22","—No.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",22
"23","14528. Where is the piece of arable land and grazing which was taken from you, and which was valued at £7?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",23
"24","—It is in this very town, beside the mill. It was cut off our township when the place was lotted out, but our rents were not reduced when we were deprived of that piece of ground.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",24
"25","14529. Who has it at present?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",25
"26","—The miller has it.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",26
"27","14530. Does the miller pay rent?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",27
"28","—We do not know. We got no abatement anyhow.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",28
"29","14531. Then £ 7 worth was cut away, and given to the miller, and you got no reduction?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",29
"30","—Yes, that is the case.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",30
"31","14532. You complain here that there are no fewer than twenty-five squatting among the rest. Do these pay any rent ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",31
"32","—No.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",32
"33","14533. Do they do anything in servicer or labour for the crofters ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",33
"34","—No, nothing whatever.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",34
"35","14534. Have they got any stock?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",35
"36","—Some have and some have not.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",36
"37","14535. Do they get potato ground in small quantities on payment of rent to the crofters ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",37
"38","—From their own relatives they do.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",38
"39","14536. What does the township propose to do with these twenty-five cottars ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",39
"40","—To get land.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",40
"41","14537. But where?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",41
"42","—Where it is?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",42
"43","14538. Where is that 'is'? ",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",43
"44","—It is lying waste, the best part of the land throughout this island, under sheep and deer, and the poor people kept in the worst parts of it, where they cannot make a livelihood out of it, and the best parts taken from them at every corner. ",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",44
"45","14539. How then do these poor people live ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",45
"46","—They can scarcely be able to live at all.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",46
"47","14540. I presume, from what you stated, that they are all connected with each other,—that they are friends and relatives,—and therefore the crofters are kind to them ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",47
"48","—Yes, they have relatives in the township.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",48
"49","14541. Are the crofters paying poor rates?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",49
"50","—Yes, and road money.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",50
"51","14542. Does it come to this, that besides paying their legal poor rates, they have practically to support these twenty-five families?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",51
"52","—Yes, that is the case. These twenty-five people must be kept up. Must not one poor family support another when there is no other way for it ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",52
"53","14543. How many of them are on the poor's roll?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",53

"55","14544. With regard to the complaint ycu make against the then chamberlain, John Munro Mackenzie, taking from you the cattle for the rent at between £1 and £2, for which would be got at this time between £7 and £8, will you explain exactly what you mean by that ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",55
"56","—These were very bad years, like this year. The markets were low, and when there was no other way for it the cow had to be sold, though it would only fetch 20s. or 25s., and BO the factor took them away, and he himself priced them.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",56
"57","14545. Did he keep them for some time until better markets prevailed, or did he sell them at once ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",57
"58","—He sold them as he was able to do it.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",58
"59","14546. Has the proprietor laid out any money on the improvement of this township within your recollection ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",59
"60","—I am not aware of any, unless perhaps, as the previous delegate stated, some Government meal was given away for assistance.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",60
"61","14547. Have you received any of the money that has been collected this year by charitable people ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",61
"62","—I myself got a little meal. Some in the township got some, and others did not.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",62
"63","14548. Were the most of them in circumstances requiring assistance ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",63
"64","—Yes, the greater part of them. I could except very few here not equally in need of it.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",64
"65","14549. Was there any complaint as to the mode of distribution?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",65
"66","—It is quite impossible to get any person in the world who can satisfy every person.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",66
"67","14550. Did you get any potato seed?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",67
"68","—I got half a bushel.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",68
"69","14551. Was that from the proprietor, or from the charitable funds?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",69
"70","—I have not paid for it, and I do not know whether I shall be called upon to pay for it or not.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",70

"72","—What rent do you pay?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",72
"73","—25s. bare rent My brother pays 25s. also. There is road money and poor money, and moorland pasture money, in addition to that.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",73
"74","14553. What do you pay for moorland pasture ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",74

"78","14555. Have you paid that 5s. ever since your lots were made by Sir James ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",78

"80","14556. How long is it since it was put on?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",80
"81","—It was in Mr Munro's time that we commenced to pay it,—off and on perhaps about ten years ago.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",81
"82","14557. How many beasts do you keep?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",82
"83","—Two cows, a stirk now and again, six or seven sheep,—sometimes perhaps only four, no horse. Though we keep two cows, what is the use of that ? The one only eats up the other. ",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",83
"84","14558. Have you to buy food for the cows?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",84
"85","—Yes, otherwise we could not keep them living.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",85
"86","14559 Where do you get it?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",86

"89","—From 12s. to £ 1 .",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",89
"90","14561. Do you consider your rent exorbitantly high ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",90
"91","—Yes, considering the nature of the soil, which is very bad.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",91
"92","14562. Would you be surprised to hear that we have come upon a great number of people iu Skye who pay more than £5, and are barely able to keep two cows, and have no sheep or horse ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",92
"93","—We ourselves could not keep one cow for all that grows out of the ground.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",93
"94","14563. What do you think would be a fair sum for you to pay for the ground you have?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",94
"95","—I would take one-third off.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",95
"96","14564. What is the most rent that anybody pays in Breasclete?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",96
"97","—£4.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",97

"104","14568. What kind of food?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",104
"105","—They buy some stuff from the mill,—meal-dust.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",105
"106","14569. Is that the only kind of food they give them, besides fodder and grass ?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",106
"107","—Sometimes we give them meal; and when we are not able to buy anything at all for them, then they and we must want.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",107

"110","14571. So it is the produce of Breasclete, after all, that feeds your cows?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",110

"119","—We bade farewell to them this year at the time of lifting them.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",119
"120","14576. Have you no potatoes now to eat?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",120
"121","—No.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",121
"122","14577. What is the food of the people of Breasclete at present ? What do they take in the mornings?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",122

"146","14589. What pay do they get?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",146

"157","—No, there has been no settlement yet, but he is providing them with meal meanwhile.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",157

"163","—You said you would like the rent of your croft reduced by one third,—that is, from 25s. to 17s. Supposing the other 17s. were taken away also, and you had your croft rent free, would you live comfortably upon it?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",163
"164","—It would not be proper that I should ask it for nothing.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",164
"165","14598. But is the size of your croft, and the productiveness of it, each that if you sat upon it rent free you could live upon it and be comfortable?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",165

"168","—Yes, if we could get it without any difficulty about it.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",168
"169","14600. In this paper of yours there are a number of grievances, but you do not ask for any particular remedy.

"171","—If they got more land, and if for the term of two years they got assistance, which they themselves might pay back afterwards by instalments, they could manage. If they got more land to work, it would be of the utmost service to them. They would be able to get increased stock as well as more produce.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",171

"178","—It is not what I call a good road.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",178
"179","14605. Did the proprietor contribute anything to make the road?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",179
"180","—I cannot say for certain, unless the assistance we got this year can be held as a contribution towards it. The greater part of the work upon the road was done this year.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",180
"181","14606. Did you receive any money wages for making the road?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",181

"188","14610. Then do these cottars, who you said were a burden to the crofters, sometimes assist their parents or other relations, or do the parents and relations always support them?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",188
"189","—They mutually assist each other.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",189
"190","14611. Are mauy of these twenty-five families of cottars engaged in fishing?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",190
"191","—Not the majority, but some of them are.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",191
"192","14612. Do any of them go round to the east coast fishing?",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",192
"193","—Yes.",255,"John Maciver","Lewis, Breasclete",193
