"1","ALEXANDER MACHARDY, Ground officer, Farr (43)—examined",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",1
"2","26164. The Chairman",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",2
"3","—How long have you held office as ground officer?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",3
"4","—Ten years.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",4
"5","26165. You have heard some statements relative to the alleged undue use of your influence as ground officer?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",5
"6","—I have.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",6
"7","26166. Especially concerning a School Board election?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",7
"8","—I have.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",8
"9","26167. You desire to make a statement?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",9
"10","—I do.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",10
"11","26168. Will you have the goodness to make it?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",11
"12","—In the case of widow Murray, on which so much stress has been laid, it is stated that I intimidated her. The old woman told me before the election that she wished to vote for Mr Crawford. She was an old frail creature, and on the morning of the election, in case of any blame being attached to me for taking her out, I called and wished her to stay at home. I had no idea Mr Mackenzie had her vote. It is said that we wished to put her out of her home. That is a wrong statement altogether, because, after the election, when her horse died, I gave her a foal myself and took the money by instalments. I wish to make that statement because it will go forth that we have been intimidating people. We did not wish to turn her out, but the croft was to be transferred to her eldest son; and a widow and eight children were staying there. Her eldest son is here. He was to give his mother so much weekly if he got charge of the lot, and now we have heard that we wished to turn the widow adrift.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",12
"13","26169. Did the widow ever receive at any time a summons of removal?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",13
"14","—She did; but it was to give the charge of the lot to her eldest son.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",14
"15","26170. Was the summons one of removal?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",15
"16","—She was not to be removed from the house, but the charge of the lot was to be conveyed to her eldest son.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",16
"17","26171. Was the summons of removal from the land sent to her after the School Board election?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",17
"18","—It was nearly three years after.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",18
"19","26172. Was there ever any desire or intention on your part to influence the vote of this widow in any sense at all?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",19
"20","—None. She told me she would give her right hand upon it that she would vote for Mr Crawford, but I knew he had plenty of votes without it, and told her to stay at home.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",20
"21","26173. When she made this declaration that she wished to vote for Mr Crawford, where was she?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",21
"22","—In her own house.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",22
"23","26174. Why did you happen to go on that occasion to her house?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",23
"24","—I am in amongst the tenants' houses every day, and there was a good deal of influence tried at that election, and the people were speaking to me, and I was speaking to them about it when the widow told me she was to vote for Mr Crawford. I told her on the morning of the election, I did not think there was any necessity for her coming out.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",24
"25","26175. When you paid her the visit on that morning had you any other business?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",25
"26","—I was going past, and was not going into the house at all, but I happened to see her son, and if it had not been for that I don't think I would have gone in at all.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",26
"27","26176. Did you originate the question of the election, or did she speak to you about it first?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",27
"28","—I cannot be sure about that. Perhaps I spoke to her, because there were four ministers wanting in and a fifth offering, and it was a general desire of the parish not to put in five clerical members.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",28
"29","26177. You may have spoken to her first?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",29
"30","—I may.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",30
"31","26178. I would like to know whether you think it perfectly right or prudent on your part, holding the position of a ground officer, to canvas people with reference to elections?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",31
"32","—I am a ratepayer and a parent, and I have a good right, I think, to speak to anybody I think proper  about that. I pay £ 10 of rent.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",32
"33","26379. There is a difficulty with reference to a person in your position in discriminating between your character as a parent and ratepayer and your character as a ground officer; your position is rather complex.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",33
"34","—I am aware of that. .",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",34
"35","26180. You state now positively that you never had any desire to influence the vote of that widow in one sense or another, and that she was at perfect liberty to vote for anybody she pleased?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",35
"36","—Perfect liberty, I said to her that we did not want her vote, as I was sure Mr Crawford had plenty of votes.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",36
"37","26181. But when you said she had better not go, that might have prevented her from voting for the minister?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",37
"38","—She did not tell me she was going to vote for the minister.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",38
"39","26182. She was not obliged to tell you?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",39
"40","—I did not know she was going to do that. I told her if she was to vote for the factor, not to go out.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",40
"41","26183. Professor Mackinnon.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",41
"42","—Was it upon the faith that she was to vote for the factor and for nobody else, that you spoke to her on the morning of the election?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",42
"43","—Yes.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",43
"44","26184. You asked her to keep back because the factor did not require her votes?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",44
"45","—I asked her not to come.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",45
"46","26185. But it was not to deprive any other person of votes?",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",46
"47","—No. I never mentioned any other soul upon earth.",440,"Alexander Machardy","Sutherland, Bettyhill",47
