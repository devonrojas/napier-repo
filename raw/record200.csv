"1","DONALD CURRIE, South Loch Boisdale, Crofter and sometimes Fisherman (47)—examined.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",1
"2","11763. The Chairman.—Have you a written statement ?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",2
"3","—No.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",3
"4","11764. Have you any verbal statement to make'",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",4
"5","—The great complaint on our side is that the land is very scarce and very poor in quality. There were five crofts, and formerly these crofts were tenanted by five tenants, but now there are fifteen tenants. As a general rule, they purchase eight bags of meal annually—this year twelve bags per family—and I think if the land had been sufficiently good, it would have been amalgamated long ago by tacks, but it is not good enough to make a tack and therefore it has escaped. We wish that we could get a proper croft—a croft sufficient to support a family, and that the croft be valued—the rent to be fixed by valuators, and any draining or trenching or improving of the land we should get compensation for, and a promise not to remove us, which we were too much accustomed to.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",5
"6","11765. What do you regard as a proper croft? What area of arable land, and what number of cows and horses, &,c. ?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",6
"7","—We would require a croft to hold six cows and two horses, and as many sheep as would keep a family",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",7
"8","in clothing—that is from forty to fifty head. ",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",8
"9","11766. How many acres arable?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",9
"10","—I cannot state acres—as much arable land as would supply a family with food.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",10
"11","11767. How many bolls of oats and how many barrels potatoes would you want to sow ?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",11
"12","—I would like to plant an average of twenty barrels a year.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",12
"13","11768. How many barrels of oats?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",13
"14","—Eight barrels of oat seed and twenty pecks of barley or bere.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",14
"15","11769. What would you think a proper rent for a croft of that kind?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",15
"16","—A valuator would be the most just to both sides.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",16
"17","11770. Do you know of any croft of that kind at present in the island here ?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",17
"18","—I know some such crofts upon the west side of the island, and in all these cases the occupants of them make a livelihood of it.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",18
"19","11771. What sort of rent do they pay now?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",19
"20","—For those crofts which I have already specified, I think the rent is from £8 to £10 a year. I don't know whether there are any sheep upon those crofts I have mentioned. There may be sheep, or there may not be.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",20
"21","11772. What stock do you keep on your own croft?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",21
"22","—I have half a croft. I have three cows and two horses, two sheep and three stirks— that is year-olds—but that is more than my proper summiug.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",22
"23","11773. How much rent do you pay?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",23
"24","—£3 of rent.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",24
"25","11774. But you hire land to feed them upon?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",25
"26","—No, but when fodder is scarce for them we often have to purchase meal for them, which we had to do this year.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",26
"27","11775. Does the half croft ever produce, in a good season, enough to keep all that stock ?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",27
"28","—There were years when the half croft did produce what sufficed.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",28
"29","11776. Do you complain of your rent being too high?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",29
"30","—It is not the dearness of the rent we complain of, but the scarcity of the land. We would be poor without paying aay rent at all on these small patches.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",30
"31","11777. If one of the tacks were cut up, and made into good crofts, would you be ablo to take one yourself? —A few would. I would attempt myself to take one of these crofts, and a few would also manage it ; and if we were placed on a good part of a tack we would soon get on.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",31
"32","11778. But supposing you got such a tack, with a lease of thirty years, at a fair rent, what sort of improvements would you make ?—I would be quite willing to pay interest on outlay for the purpose of improving the land. I don't want a lease of thirty years or one hundred years, but simply that I should have the land as long as I am able to pay its rent. ",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",32
"33","11779. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—Have you ever seen any person lose his croft on account of his arrears?—There are none upon my side of the loch, because no one is in arrears, but I heard of people being put out. ",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",33
"34","11780. Did you ever hear of the succeeding man paying the original tenant's arrears ?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",34
"35","—If a son were taking a croft after his father, he would have to pay his father's arrears.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",35
"36","11781. But when there is a change of tenancy?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",36
"37","—I did not pay any arrears.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",37
"38","11782. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—Were there arrears on the croft when you went in ?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",38
"39","—I don't think that there were arrears on my father's croft, and my father got another croft which he still occupies. I did not hear from him that he paid the arrears of the out-going tenant.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",39
"40","11783. What is the value of the beasts you sell upon your owu croft? What was the last beast you sold ?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",40
"41","—I sold one stirk at the last market in July.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",41
"42","11784. What did you get for it?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",42
"43","—I got £4, 15s.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",43
"44","11785. Was that considered a good price",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",44
"45","—Yes, it was considered a good price.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",45
"46","11786. Are you ever able to sell more than one beast?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",46
"47","—Some years I am able to sell two.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",47
"48","11787. But that is from the.additional stock you keep, not from what the croft would keep ?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",48
"49","—The year before last I sold two.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",49
"50","11788. Were they properly brought up and fed on the croft?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",50
"51","—They were all brought up and reared on the croft.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",51
"52","11789. What did you. get for these two?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",52
"53","—About 10 guineas for the pair.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",53
"54","11790. What is the summing of your croft ?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",54
"55","—I don't know. I never saw it ; I don't know what the summing should be.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",55
"56","11791. Professor MacKinnon.—Have all the crofters as much stock as you ?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",56
"57","—Some have one cow and some two.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",57
"58","11792. Do you pay anything for the summer grazing of them?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",58
"59","—Nothing.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",59
"60","11793. Then you have only your own summing?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",60
"61","—Only my own summing.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",61
"62","11794. And you only pay £3 for two horses, three cows, and three stirks ?",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",62
"63","—Yes.",200,"Donald Currie","South Uist, Lochboisdale",63
