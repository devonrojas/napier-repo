"1","RODERICK MACKAY, Crofter and Fisherman, Dryharbour, Rona (56)—examined.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",1
"2","7982. The Chairman.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",3
"4","—Yes.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",4
"5","7983. Will you make your statement?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",5
"6","—In the first place, the same as others said, the dearness of the soil; and in the next place, how we are",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",6
"7","crowded upon each other, so that we cannot take a living out of it. There are some in our township who remember when there were only seven families in the township, and there are now fifteen families. Should they get the place for nothing, they would not make a living out of it. They would need to get another place. I am now going to tell the rise that took place in our rents. Our township was formerly rented at £50 in all, and it is now £80. When there were seven families in the township it was £50, and now it is £80. ",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",7
"8","7984. Is the land the same, or has any land been taken away?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",8
"9","—The land is the same. There has been no land taken from us. I remember one of the families in a township in which there was a considerable number—numbering eight children. Half of their land was taken away from them, and another family was placed along with them upon the remainder.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",9
"10","7985. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",10
"11","—Where from?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",11
"12","—From Fearn, when the people were sent away. Then the ground is so soft that it will not yield crop. We are making ditches in part of our arable land, and while we are making these ditches we require to have planks under our feet, and if a man misses that plank another one will need to help him out of the bog. The people will never be right there, and they can never be but poor if they will not get another place. They need many things. They cannot cut a peat for fuel.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",12
"13","7986. Do you mean there are no peats in Rona?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",13
"14","—There are peats in Rona yet, but the peat will not last long, owing to the number of families who use it.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",14
"15","7987. Mr Cameron.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",15
"16","—What rent do you pay yourself?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",16
"17","—£5, 12s. 6d., besides road money and poor rates.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",17
"18","7988. Did you get any abatement this year?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",18
"19","—Yes, we got one-third abated to us.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",19
"20","7989. What did you pay this year?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",20
"21","—I don't remember the exact penny.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",21
"22","7990. What is your summing?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",22
"23","—Two cows and a two-year-old and two sheep.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",23
"24","7991. Is that the summing, or is it what you have?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",24
"25","—We were keeping three cows upon the croft, but it would not be justice to two. Though I have the two cows that are named upon me, they don't belong to me. They belong to merchants in Portree and Glasgow. It is they who are keeping me in meal.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",25
"26","7992. How many sheep have you?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",26
"27","—Nine or ten.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",27
"28","7993. Why are you short of sheep?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",28
"29","—Poverty, that I cannot procure the stock. I am rearing a family on poverty.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",29
"30","7994. Do you do any work?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",30
"31","—I go to the fishing every year. I have gone for the past twenty-eight years.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",31
"32","7995. Do you go to the east coast fishing?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",32
"33","—Yes, Peterhead and Fraserburgh.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",33
"34","7996. Would you like to have a sufficiently large croft to enable you to dispense with going to the fishing?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",34
"35","—Yes, that is what would do good to us, but I am getting old.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",35
"36","7997. Sheriff Nicolson.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",36
"37","—You are only fifty-six?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",37
"38","—Yes.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",38
"39","7998. Mr Cameron.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",39
"40","—Don't the people make a better living by having these small crofts, and going to the fishing, than by having large crofts and staying at home all the year round?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",40
"41","—They would be better than in the place in which they are, wherever they would go. The land is in spots here and there. Our arable land is so far from us that should I leave at six o'clock in the morning, I could not get home before eight or nine o’clock at night—the land is so far away from us.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",41
"42","7999. Then would you have, in any case, to depend upon the fishing for your subsistence?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",42
"43","—Yes, no other means of subsistence except my earnings.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",43
"44","8000. I mean even though you had not a croft?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",44
"45","—I don't know as to that, if the land would yield a good crop—if there were a place in which man could have stock. Our place will never be right so long as it is so densely peopled.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",45
"46","8001. How many people will require to leave the place in order to leave the rest as much land as you wish?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",46
"47","—I should only apportion the township to five families to keep them comfortable.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",47
"48","8002. How did the fifteen families get to the place?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",48
"49","—Some of them were families who were taken from townships that were cleared. ",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",49
"50","8003. How many were taken from townships that were cleared?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",50
"51","—There are two families of these.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",51
"52","8004. Where did the rest come from?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",52
"53","—The natural increase of the place.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",53
"54","8005. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",54
"55","—Have you any goats?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",55
"56","—No.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",56
"57","8006. Are you not accustomed to keep goats in Rona?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",57
"58","—No; goats would suit better.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",58
"59","8007. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",59
"60","—How did your place get the name of Dryharbour? ",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",60
"61","—For generations; I cannot tell.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",61
"62","8008. What is it in Gaelic ?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",62
"63","—A dry anchorage.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",63
"64","8009. Is there no other name upon your township?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",64
"65","—No.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",65
"66","8010. Or upon the other one called Big Harbour?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",66
"67","—That is the only name.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",67
"68","8011. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",68

"70","—Yes.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",70
"71","8012. Where would you wish to go to?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",71
"72","—Any of the places that are waste in the island.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",72
"73","8013. Is it the general wish of the people to leave Rona?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",73
"74","—Yes, they most desire that.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",74
"75","8014. But they would not wish to go beyond this property?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",75
"76","—I did not hear anything of that sort from any of them.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",76
"77","8015. Was the population of Rona at one time larger than it is now?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",77
"78","—No.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",78
"79","8016. Never so high?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",79
"80","—No. If Rona would carry sheep as well as the rest of Raasay, it would have been cleared the same as the other townships of Raasay.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",80
"81","8017. You heard what the other delegates said about the evictions. Have you anything new to add? Did you witness them?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",81
"82","—Yes, I remember the work going on.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",82
"83","8018. What has become of the M'Leods of Raasay?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",83
"84","—I don't know. I don't think any of the family are alive to-day.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",84
"85","8019. Sheriff Nicolson.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",85

"90","8021. Did you get your boats destroyed in the storm the year before last?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",90
"91","—Some.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",91

"93","—Yes.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",93
"94","8023. Better than the old ones?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",94

"101","—The east side is better for fishing, but some years it is not so good.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",101
"102","8027. Do you cure any of the fish yourselves, or does anybody take them from you and sell them?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",102
"103","—We cure most. We are not conveniently situated for the market.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",103
"104","8028. You have a pretty good harbour at Rona, have you not?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",104

"119","—No.",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",119
"120","8036. Do you consider that any disadvantage to the children?",151,"Roderick Mackay","Raasay, Torran",120
