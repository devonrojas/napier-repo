"1","ALEXANDER DUNCAN FRASER, M.B. (Edin.)—examined.",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",1
"2","3811. The Chairman.",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",2
"3","—How long have you been settled in Skye?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",3
"4","— Six years. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",4
"5","3812. Are you a native of Skye?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",5
"6","—No. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",6
"7","3813. Are you a native of the Western Highlands ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",7
"8","—I am a native of Argyleshire. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",8
"9","3814. During the six years you have been resident here you have had good opportunities of noticing the physical condition of the people ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",9
"10","—I have. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",10
"11","3815. Would you kindly state to the Commission what you think of the physical condition of the people, especially with reference to the alleged deterioration during the past few years. Do you think the people, when you first came into the country, were in a better physical condition—better fed, and better dressed, than they are now, or not ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",11
"12","—I know that a number of them were better fed and better dressed than they are now. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",12
"13","3816. What is the cause of this deterioration which you have noticed ? ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",13
"14","—-I think that the bad seasons have had to do with it. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",14
"15","3817. Have you had any reason to believe that the soil is itself exhausted, or less capable of yielding grain crops than it formerly was ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",15
"16","—I am quite sure, from the system of cropping adopted, that the soil is less capable of giving crops to-day than it was some years ago. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",16
"17","3818. Is it within your knowledge that tracts of common grazing, sheep grazing, have been withdrawn from the crofters of late years ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",17
"18","—It is not ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",18
"19","3819. You have no knowledge of it?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",19
"20","—I have no knowledge of it ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",20
"21","3820. Have you heard of it in the country generally?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",21
"22","—I cannot say I have. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",22
"23","3821. Have you reason to think that the deterioration in the clothing of the people has any connection with the alleged fact that they have less wool of their own for domestic manufacture than they had ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",23
"24","—I have heard that .stated. I believe they are not able to buy the wool they were once able to buy, for want of ready money. They are too fond of dealing in bills. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",24
"25","3822. Do you think that the quality of the lodging of the people, or of their food, is prejudicial to their health ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",25
"26","—If they did not live so much in the open air I am sure that many of the houses would certainly be prejudicial to the health of the people, and the quality of the food too. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",26
"27","3823. Are you aware of any cases of disease in the country which can be distinctly traced to the character of the habitations or the food ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",27
"28","—I believe I am. I have seen a good deal of scrofulous disease, and also a good deal of lung disease, and a large proportion of eye disease, all due to ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",28
"29","the houses and food and want of clothing. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",29
"30","3824. Has it come within your notice that the children are frequently in want of milk, or have they a sufficient command of milk ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",30
"31","—They have nothing like a command of milk. Even at the present hour they have not sufficient milk. There is no grass at present for the cows to make milk with, and they cannot feed them with either meal or potatoes or anything else ; and the cows that have calved this year are giving little or no milk at the present time. The calves require all the milk, and, in addition, meal and other foods. I know that in general cases myself, and it is a difficulty with me in treating people when I recommend them to have milk that they say they cannot get it. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",31
"32","3825. Sheriff Nicolson.",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",32
"33","—Did you, from your personal experience this season find some cases of extreme poverty in Edinbane ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",33
"34","—I did. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",34
"35","3826. Poverty reaching to what may correctly be called destitution ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",35
"36","— I did. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",36
"37","3827. Did you find some cases of families being actually in want of food ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",37
"38","—I did. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",38
"39","3828. To what do you attribute their condition ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",39
"40","—Well, to the failure of the potatoes last year, and the destruction of the corn with the gales. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",40
"41","3829. Did you find many instances of that ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",41
"42","—Well, I found three instances in one day. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",42
"43","3830. Of families that were actually in want of food?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",43
"44","—Without a bite of food in the house, and actually borrowing from neighbours not much better off than themselves, and who had lent their last handful of meal, and must have starved but for the assistance they got. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",44
"45","3831. That was the reason why you made a public appeal for assistance ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",45
"46","—I made no public appeal, properly speaking, for assistance. I wrote to my own friends for assistance, and got it; but, before getting it, I had to send a telegram for food for the people. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",46
"47","3832. The accuracy of your statements on the subject has been questioned by some writers in one newspaper, at least, and the charitable efforts you have made were even sneered at in one letter I read myself. Was there any ground for the assertions made in that letter ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",47
"48","—I know of no grounds. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",48
"49","3833. You made a reply to that letter in the Inverness Courier ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",49
"50","—I did. I sent a reply to the Scotsman, but they refused to put it in, on the ground of length, which was perhaps the only ground. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",50
"51","3834. Are you willing to give in that letter as a statement of some of the facts connected with the destitution in Edinbane ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",51
"52","—Certainly. (see Appendix A. XVII)",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",52
"53","3835. You are surgeon to the Gesto Hospital?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",53
"54","—Yes. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",54
"55","3836. I suppose that institution is of great value to the country ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",55
"56","— It is. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",56
"57","3837. It was founded by the late Kenneth M'Leod ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",57
"58","—It was. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",58
"59","3838. What is the average attendance there?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",59
"60","—The average daily attendance there for the last year was ten. There are only twelve beds, so it only left two vacancies. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",60
"61","3839. Are there ever more applications than you can supply ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",61
"62","—Yes, often. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",62
"63","3840. What class of diseases are most common?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",63
"64","—This year, eye diseases from want of food—I mean, the usual cause is want of food,— ulceration of the cornea, and so on; scrofulous complaints, and abscesses connected with diseased bone. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",64
"65","3841. You spoke of consumption. You, as a recent comer to Skye, don't know much about the past history of Skye, but have you heard or made any inquiries as to the health of the people in former times in that respect, and whether consumption was more common in former times than it is now ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",65
"66","—I have heard it was not common in former times. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",66
"67","3842. I think the late Sir Robert Christison wrote something to that effect ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",67
"68","—I cannot say. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",68
"69","3843. What are the chief causes of consumption now ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",69
"70","—Most of those cases I have seen, in grown-up people especially, have been cases of people who have gone to the south. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",70
"71","3844. People catching colds, and neglecting them ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",71
"72","—I suppose that is the cause of it. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",72
"73","3845. Has the badness of clothing anything to do with the catching of cold?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",73
"74","—There is no doubt of that; badness of clothes and want of food. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",74
"75","3846. We have heard, in one other place at least, the suggestion that the excessive labour to which they are subjected weakens the constitution of the people. Do you think there is anything in that ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",75
"76","—I don't think there is anything in that. If they had the food to take they could stand the labour, and a great deal more. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",76
"77","3847. Are the children generally not very well clothed ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",77
"78","—They are very badly clothed. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",78
"79","3848. They generally go barefooted ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",79
"80","—Barefooted, a number of them, summer and winter and bareheaded too. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",80
"81","3849. But I suppose you don't consider it very bad for them 1",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",81
"82","—I consider it bad for them, in winter, to be barefooted and bareheaded. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",82
"83","3850. When they go to school, whether do you think it is better for them to go barefooted, or to go and sit in the school with wet shoes on ? ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",83
"84","—Bare feet are certainly better.",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",84
"85","3851. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",85
"86","—Are you sure of the bareheadedness being against them ? Do you know that the Blue Coat School boys are not allowed to wear anything on their heads ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",86
"87","—I am aware. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",87
"88","3852. Don't you think it gives them a better head of hair ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",88
"89","—If the insides of the children here were as well lined as the Blue Coat boys they might stand to have their heads bare; otherwise I do not see how they could. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",89
"90","3853. Have you anything more to suggest to the Commission ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",90
"91","—I have nothing. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",91
"92","3854. Mr Cameron.",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",92
"93","—Have you, in your experience, often found two families residing in one house amongst the crofters ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",93
"94","—Not often. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",94
"95","3855. But occasionally ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",95
"96","—Occasionally. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",96
"97","3856. I suppose you consider that very prejudicial to the health of the families ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",97
"98","—I certainly do. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",98
"99","3857. And it has other disadvantages besides ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",99
"100","—Yes. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",100
"101","3858. Have you ever taken advantage of your position as a medical man, and remonstrated with them for it -",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",101
"102","—I cannot say I have. I did not know what remedies to suggest. There was no use pulling down till one was prepared to build up. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",102
"103","3859. Do the people eat much fish here ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",103
"104","—They do, when the fishing is at all good. This year they have not done much, fishing. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",104
"105","3860. Do they get as a rule an abundant supply of fish in good years I ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",105
"106","—They generally get sufficient herring to salt for winter use. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",106
"107","3861. I suppose you consider fish a very nutritious and a very valuable article of food ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",107
"108","—I do. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",108
"109","3862. Do you find that eating too much of one kind of food has the effect of producing dyspepsia and kindred diseases ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",109
"110","—It does. There is scarcely a patient who comes to me who has not dyspepsia. It is the commonest disease of any. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",110
"111","3863. Do you attribute that to anything except eating large quantities of oatmeal ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",111
"112","—Quantities of oatmeal and no other food. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",112
"113","3864. That is the principal cause ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",113
"114","—The principal cause. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",114
"115","3865. Can you suggest any improvement in their food that is within the reach of the people ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",115
"116","—If they would not sell their eggs for tea. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",116
"117","3866. They exchange their eggs for tea Ì",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",117
"118","—I always tell them to use their eggs. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",118
"119","3867. Is there a good market for eggs here ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",119
"120","—They sell them to the local merchants. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",120
"121","3868. What price do they get for them 1",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",121
"122","—They were getting as high as 8d. this winter. They look upon that as a very good price. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",122
"123","3869. Do they sell them to the steamers in summer ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",123
"124","—Not in my district ; there are no steamers coming in. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",124
"125","3870. The Chairman.",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",125
"126","—You stated that in some cases you have seen two families occupying the same house. In those cases were the families nearly related to each other, such as the family of the father and the family of the son, or were there sometimes two families strangers to each other living in the same house 1",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",126
"127","—The cases I have seen were those of father and son, I believe. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",127
"128","3871. Will you state whether, in the course of your practice among the poor, destitute, and sick, you have received any spontaneous assistance from the proprietors and factors or their families,—I mean in supplying diet or in distributing alms, or in assisting the poor in sickness?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",128
"129","—I have received assistance from the proprietor's family in Grishornish, and also from the shooting tenants in the lodge at Edinbane, who were always willing to do anything for the sick people when I mention the fact that ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",129
"130","they wanted anything. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",130
"131","3872. Professor Mackinnon.",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",131
"132","—This last year was exceptional, but I understood you to say that the condition of the people is so poor as to be to some extent prejudicial to their health ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",132
"133","—Yes; I think the diet is much too limited even in a good year,—potatoes, fish, and meal. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",133
"134","3873. Have you turned your mind in any way to a remedy of a more or less permanent kind to bring about a different state of matters ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",134
"135","—I do not see a remedy. There are too many people on the land, but I do not see how you are to get rid of them, unless by the natural causes operating over a number of years. As crofts become vacant, let them be vacant, or join them to the neighbouring ones. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",135
"136","3874. You are quite of the opinion which the crofters express, that the crofts are too small ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",136
"137","—I am quite satisfied of that. They will trust to their small crofts, and the least disease in the potatoes or destruction of their crops immediately brings them to the verge of want. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",137
"138","3875. In their statement, the people themselves say that fishing should be distinct from crofting, but when the witness was examined upon it, I understood him to mean that that was a general statement, and that it had no particular reference to the district of Edinbane, where they all evidently wish to be crofters. I suppose, as a general statement, you would agree with the expression 1",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",138
"139","—I would, as a general statement. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",139
"140","3876. You find that consumption is chiefly among the young who have been south 1",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",140
"141","—That has been my experience up to last year. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",141
"142","3877. That is also my experience. Can you, as a medical man, give me any explanation of it?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",142
"143","—I have always believed that those people, when they go south, being used to living here on their small means, take lodgings in a poor part of the town, and, having to pay for everything they eat and drink, they starve themselves, and go about with too few clothes on, and they want the fresh air and everything they have here. In that way I believe they get consumption; I don't know any other reason for it. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",143
"144","3878. The hard work and the bad air is not sufficiently counteracted by the amount of good healthy food they take ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",144
"145","—No, and they have not the rests from labour which they have here ; for even if they have little food, if they are not being worked, they still keep free from all disease except dyspepsia. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",145
"146","3879. That is to say at home?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",146
"147","—Yes. In the south they must work, and live on very little. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",147
"148","3880. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",148
"149","—Do you think the want of food is the cause of the people remaining comparatively idle during the winter months. The people of this country do not display great energy in cultivating their crofts during the winter months ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",149
"150","—No, they don't work much during -winter. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",150
"151","3881. Do you think the want of food is very much the cause of that habit ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",151
"152","—I am sure they feel very much less inclined to work when they are not well fed, judging by what I feel myself. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",152
"153","3882. But you think, if, their food was better, they would display more energy ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",153
"154","—I am sure they would; there are no better workers as navvies than Skyemen, but then they are having their beef three times a day. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",154
"155","3883. One witness in another place told us the weather was so bad in the winter months, from new year to the sowing time, that it was impossible to work outside. Was that your experience 1",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",155
"156","—During the last two or three winters I could not get my own work done for the length of bad weather. It sometimes rains for weeks and weeks. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",156
"157","3884. And that is prejudicial to the pursuit of agriculture in this district ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",157
"158","—It is. I do not think corn crops pay in this country at all. It is much better to lay the land down in grass. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",158
"159","3885. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",159
"160","—You ride about continually?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",160
"161","—I do. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",161
"162","3886. Have you been over the most of Skye?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",162
"163","—I have, except the south part. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",163
"164","3887. In the course of your observations, don't you constantly see here and there the ruins and remains of scores, I may say hundreds of houses, that had been once occupied by people %",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",164
"165","—On every hill side. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",165
"166","3888. Does not the appearance presented by the grass about those places denote that there must be considerable depth of good soil about those places? Don't they look exceedingly pretty and green ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",166
"167","—Yes, most of them look exceedingly pretty and green. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",167
"168","3889. Professor MacKinnon.",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",168
"169","—Yesterday we had a schoolmaster, a stranger in the country—only one year in the country—suggesting that the children in this district were scarcely so clever as the children of the south. Would you consider the people of the district equal upon the average, in mental as well as physical capacity, to the people of the rest of the country ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",169
"170","—Yes, I do. I believe that is so. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",170
"171","3890. Mentally as well as physically?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",171
"172","—Mentally as well as physically. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",172
"173","3891. And physically fully equal to the average, if they were well fed ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",173
"174","—Certainly. One thing I have noticed. I have noticed that children who seemed starved and meagre up to a certain age,—twelve to fifteen,—all of a sudden shoot up to be great stout men. They go away to the south, and come back great strong men in one year. It struck me over and over again. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",174
"175","3892. How do you account for that?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",175
"176","—I cannot account for that",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",176
"177","3893. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",177
"178","—Will it not be accounted for in this way : that they were in regular service and got regular food, which they did not buy themselves ?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",178
"179","—That might partly account for it. ",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",179
"180","3894. Professor Mackinnon.",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",180
"181","—But even the people that do not go south manage to get big and strong?",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",181
"182","—Yes, some of them; many of them do.",64,"Alexander Duncan Fraser","Skye, Dunvegan",182
