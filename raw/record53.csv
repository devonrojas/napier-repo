"5","3184. What statement have you to make on behalf of those whom you represent?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",5
"6","—That the land is too dear, and too little of it. I was paying £3, 5s. for a bit of ground. I could only keep one cow, and I had a heavy family. I was six years continuously that I had to kill the six calves to see if I could get a cup of milk for the children, for I could not keep them alive, for I had no grazing on which to feed the cow; I had no horse.(see Appendix A. VII)",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",6
"7","3185. Is that the general condition of your neighbours?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",7

"9","3186. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",9
"10","—Have you given your place up?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",10
"11","—No, Mr Gordon Macleod was the landlord then, but Captain Macdonald is now the landlord. We got a little more land since. I got 8 or 9 yards breadth added to my croft, for which I paid 25s. of bare rent. I now keep two cows. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",11
"12","3187. The Chairman.",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",12
"13","—What was the length of his strips of ground 8 or 9 yards wide ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",13

"18","—-Near 200. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",18
"19","3190. Professor Mackinnon.",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",19
"20","—How much do you pay?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",20

"22","3191. How many cows do you keep now?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",22
"23","—Two cows, but I have not got as much grass as would keep one sufficiently. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",23

"25","—We have hill. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",25
"26","3193. How many are there of you?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",26
"27","—About forty in the township. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",27
"28","3194. And each keeps two cows?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",28
"29","—There are some who have only one cow. There are full shares aud half shares in the township. I have half a croft. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",29
"30","3195. And those that have the full share can keep four cows?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",30
"31","—Yes. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",31
"32","3196. About those that have only one cow, does that arise because they are not allowed to keep more than one, or because they are not able to keep more ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",32
"33","—They are not allowed. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",33

"36","3198. Have you any sheep ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",36
"37","—About twelve or fourteen for my half share, but the hill pasture is so bad. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",37
"38","3199. The £ 5 of rent includes the rates?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",38

"40","3200. There is £ 5 and the rates as well?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",40
"41","—Yes. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",41
"42","3201. What do you think would improve your condition ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",42
"43","—Oh, to get the land cheaper and more of it, to enable us to keep more stock. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",43
"44","3202. Is there more of it to be had ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",44
"45","—Plenty in the Isle of Skye. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",45
"46","3203. But upon this estate ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",46
"47","—I do not know, but there is a good deal. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",47
"48","3204. Is it more hill pasture, or more arable ground that you want?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",48
"49","—We want more hill pasture and more arable ground. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",49
"50","3205. You have not a horse?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",50
"51","—No, I have not; but there are those in the township who have horses. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",51
"52","3206. Those who have a full lot pay £1 0 1",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",52
"53","—Yes. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",53
"54","3207. And their stock is one horse, four cows, and about twenty-four sheep ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",54
"55","—Yes. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",55
"56","3208. Are any of them to be here to-day ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",56
"57","—Yes. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",57
"58","3209. Do you consider their lot big enough?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",58
"59","—I do not know that it is ; they are complaining that the crop will not sow the ground. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",59
"60","3210. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",60
"61","—Would you be satisfied with the full croft?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",61
"62","—I would not be satisfied with the full croft as it is to-day, for it is too dear. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",62
"63","* See Appendix A, VII. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",63
"64","3211. Professor Mackinnon.",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",64
"65","—You think the rent of £10 is too high? ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",65
"66","—Yes, I do.",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",66
"67","3212. And you think the summing for it is too great?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",67
"68","—Yes.",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",68
"69","3213. What would you consider a fair rent for it?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",69
"70","—About half, or a little more. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",70
"71","3214. What would you consider a fair summing for it to give proper summer pasture ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",71
"72","—It would give me enough to do to keep one horse and one cow, and about twenty-five or thirty sheep. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",72
"73","3215. And the rent of that would be what?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",73
"74","—Half of the present rent. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",74
"75","3216. That is only £5?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",75
"76","—Yes. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",76
"77","3217. So you think really the croft is double its proper rent ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",77
"78","—Yes, I do. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",78
"79","3218. Well, if each croft were doubled in that way, how would you dispose of the people who are in the place ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",79
"80","—I cannot tell that, as there is not room for them. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",80
"81","3219. Is there not a place you could send them to on this estate?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",81
"82","—I do not know but there is, if it were well divided among them all. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",82
"83","3220. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",83
"84","—Would any of the people here be anxious to emigrate if they got assistance?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",84
"85","—I do not know; I believe they would not be very willing. They are too much attached to the old places. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",85
"86","3221. Have they any friends in America ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",86
"87","—I do not know. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",87
"88","3222. Or anywhere abroad,",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",88
"89","—in Australia ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",89
"90","—Some of them have, but I don't know. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",90
"91","3223. Professor Mackinnon.",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",91
"92","—Have you not been born and brought up in the place ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",92
"93","—No. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",93
"94","3224. Where were you ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",94
"95","—Duirinish. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",95
"96","3225. How long have you been in your present croft?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",96
"97","—Twenty-three or twenty-four years paying rent, and altogether I have been about thirty-six years in this parish. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",97
"98","3226. Have there not been some people that went abroad from this district during that time?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",98
"99","—Yes. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",99
"100","3227. Are they doing well ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",100
"101","—I am not hearing. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",101
"102","3228. Don't they write home to their people ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",102
"103","—Very seldom. It is a long time since I heard of their writing at all. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",103
"104","3229. Then what do you propose to do with these people that would have to be put out of your place before the place could be made comfortable for the crofters ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",104
"105","—Spread them. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",105
"106","3230. In Skye?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",106
"107","—Spread them over Skye. The one who preferred staying could do so, and the one who did not could go away. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",107
"108","3231. When they were talking over that question among themselves, I suppose they did not take up the question of some of them going away altogether out of the island?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",108
"109","—No, we had no idea of anything of the kind. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",109
"110","3232. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",110
"111","—Suppose it were possible to give them larger holdings, does it consist with your knowledge that the people here have money enough to stock these larger holdings ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",111
"112","—No, they have not money enough to stock larger holdings. They cannot have money to stock larger holdings. The most of them would not get a bag of meal on credit. ",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",112
"113","3233. Then, what would be the use of dividing the land in Skye among them ?",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",113
"114","—No use, unless they would get help. They will only die as it is. Should I get the land I have for nothing it would not keep me alive.",53,"Charles Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",114
