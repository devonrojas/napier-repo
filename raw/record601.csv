"1","ALEXANDER MACDONALD, Crofter, Bunavullin—examined.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",1
"2","36306. The Chairman.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",2
"3","—Have you been chosen by the people as a delegate ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",3
"4","—Yes.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",4
"5","36307. Have you a written statement ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",5
"6","—Yes.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",6
"7","—' Bunavullin. This township is also on the estate of Glenmorven under Beattie's trustees.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",7
"8","Our grievances are—",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",8
"9","(1) That we have too little hill pasture for the summer grazing of our cattle. Our summing is two cows and one calf, which must be sold when a year old for want of grazing. ",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",9
"10","(2) Our arable land is so small that we cannot provide fodder for wintering our beasts. We have to buy for them, which we consider a great hardship, as there is plenty of good land close beside us very suitable for us if we could get it at a reasonable rent. ",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",10
"11","(3) The extent of arable land held by each of us is about I f acre of very inferior land. We pay a rent of £6, exclusive of taxes, which we consider far too high. We cannot get a day's work on the estate from one year's end to another, but have to go about here and there where we can get work. Our  houses are built too near the sea-shore, and in winter time are very damp because of the sea spray. There is a piece of land adjoining us between Glenmorven shooting lodge and our crofts, which if given to us we are willing to pay a fair rent for it. We have no special complaint against either the proprietrix or her factor, but we wish to have more hill pasture and our crofts enlarged. We are able to stock more land if we could get i t We have at present three horses, but owing to our restricted grazing we cannot keep but inferior animals. Our delegate will be glad to answer any questions.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",11
"12","36308. The first complaint is that you have too little hill pasture. How long has this township of Bunavullin existed ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",12
"13","—At least forty years, so far as I know.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",13
"14","36309. Were there any people in the place before that, or were they brought there?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",14
"15","—They were brought there at that time, or a little previous, and houses were built about that time.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",15
"16","36310. To whom did the place belong?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",16
"17","—To Miss Stewart.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",17
"18","36311. Where were they brought from —from other places on the same estate?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",18
"19","—Some of the people who came there were on the estate previously in another place.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",19
"20","36312. By whom was the land of Bunavidlin occupied previously?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",20
"21","Was it crofters' land, or a sheep farm, or what ? ",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",21
"22","—Previous to the time the people came there it was occupied as a large farm.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",22
"23","36313. When the people were brought there they were given some arable land. Were they also given any hill pasture ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",23
"24","—We have just now all the hill pasture we had at the beginning. The people were sent there as labourers.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",24
"25","36311. You were sent there forty years ago. Have your crofts been Macdonald, subdivided, or are there the same number of crofts as there were at first ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",25
"26","— So far as I know or recollect, the crofts are just as they were at the beginning ; they have not been subdivided.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",26
"27","36315. The summing is two cows and one calf, for which you pay £6?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",27
"28","—There are two cows and a calf, and we have a horse among every three.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",28
"29","36316. You complain that you are paying for two cows, and that you cannot support them; how much have you to pay for the winter keep of a cow?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",29
"30","—I bought myself last winter £2 worth of feeding for my cattle. There may be some of the others who have bought more, and there may be some who have bought less.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",30
"31","36317. How many cattle had you during the winter? Had you two cows and one follower ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",31
"32","—Two cows and one follower.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",32
"33","36318. And you paid £2 for fodder. Did that include the keep of the horse, if you have the part of a horse ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",33
"34","—That includes all the fodder I have bought together.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",34
"35","36319. Does the horse all belong to one person, or do you go shares in the horse ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",35
"36","—We go shares for the horse.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",36
"37","36320. Do you keep the horse alternately, or how ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",37
"38","—One of us feeds the horse alternately when it is our turn; but the horses are not generally housed ; they are allowed to live outside. ",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",38
"39","36321. Do you buy corn for your horses, or do you give them your own corn ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",39
"40","—We feed them with our own corn so long as it lasts, and after that we have to buy.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",40
"41","36322. You complain that the houses are built near the sea-shore. When people were brought to Bunavullin, who built the houses for them ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",41
"42","—The proprietor built the houses.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",42
"43","36323. What sort of houses are they? Are they all slated houses?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",43
"44","—They are slated houses.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",44
"45","36324. And have they been slated houses from the beginning, forty years ago ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",45
"46","—The houses were slated when built.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",46
"47","36325. Did you ever hear how much each house had cost the proprietor ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",47
"48","—No.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",48
"49","36326. Are they good, substantial houses?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",49
"50","—The houses are reasonably large, but there is only one room.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",50
"51","36327. Do you mean that there is a kitchen and one room, or only one room, which is a kitchen and everything else?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",51
"52","—There is only one apartment.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",52
"53","36328. Is the apartment divided by the beds being put across the middle ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",53
"54","—The arrangement of the beds, or how they are placed, is left to ourselves, but they are generally placed along the wall.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",54
"55","36329. I am to understand that there is really only one room, and that the way the beds are placed does not make it into two rooms ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",55
"56","—Yes, that is so.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",56
"57","36330. Are there any cases in which two families are living in one room ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",57
"58","—No ; each family have one room to themselves.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",58
"59","36331. Is there any loft above ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",59
"60","—Yes.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",60
"61","36332. Do people sleep in the loft?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",61
"62","—Yes, a bed can be placed in the loft, but we have to use the loft as a barn. It was intended for that",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",62
"63","36333. Are all the houses alike?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",63
"64","—Yes, all very much alike.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",64
"65","36334. About what size is this one room?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",65
"66","—The houses are from 12 feet to 14 feet each way.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",66
"67","36335. Have the people ever built any additions themselves to these original houses?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",67
"68","—They have built no additions to the houses behind. They could not do that, because the byres and places for the horses were built at the back.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",68
"69","36336. Have you ever turned a byre into a room, and built another byre ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",69
"70","—No.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",70
"71","36337. Why were the houses built so near the sea-coast?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",71
"72","—It is my opinion that the houses were built so near the sea that they might take up as little room as possible.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",72
"73","36338. You say there is a piece of land adjoining you, between Glenmorven shooting lodge and the crofts, which would be convenient to you. How is that piece of land at present occupied ? Is it occupied by the farmer ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",73
"74","—It is occupied by a large farmer.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",74
"75","36339. It is not occupied by the shooting lodge?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",75
"76","—No, it is not occupied by the proprietor of the shooting lodge.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",76
"77","36340. Is it arable ground, or is it rough pasture?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",77
"78","—Previously the land was mostly all arable, and it can very easily be turned into arable land again.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",78
"79","36341. Is it land which is useful to the farmer for wintering his stock ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",79
"80","—No doubt the land is perhaps very useful to the farmer, because it is lying very near to the sea.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",80
"81","36342. Is the farm well provided with low-lying land in other places?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",81
"82","—On the side on which we are situated the farm goes from sea to sea—one branch of the sea goes in at one side, and the Sound of Mull goes in at the other side. On this side there is not much low-lying ground, but there is plenty on the east side of the farm.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",82
"83","36343. Can this land which you want be taken from the farm without doing it a material injury?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",83
"84","—It is my opinion that, although that portion were taken from the farmer, he would have sufficient ground. He has a very large farm, and would have sufficient ground otherwise.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",84
"85","36344. Would you pay rent for it if it were taken from the farmer?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",85
"86","—I think we are paying dear enough with that land along with what we hold at present, because we have not sufficient grazings for the cows.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",86
"87","36345. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",87
"88","—Did your crops suffer from the gale of last October ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",88
"89","—Not to any great extent.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",89
"90","36346. Is £2 your average expenditure year after year in food for cattle ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",90
"91","—It depends very much on what sort of winter it is. One winter is perhaps less severe than another; and if a winter is very severe, we have to buy more. Last winter we had to give our cattle meal",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",91
"92","36347. Professor Mackinnon.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",92
"93","—How long have you yourself been at Bunavullin ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",93
"94","—About fifteen years.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",94
"95","36348. Where were you before that ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",95
"96","—On Lady Gordon's estate—Drimnin.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",96
"97","36349. Had you land there ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",97
"98","—Yes.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",98
"99","36350. Are there people in that place yet who were there fifteen years ago ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",99
"100","—No.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",100
"101","36351. What became of them?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",101
"102","—They were removed. Some are in Glasgow, and some in other places on the adjoining estate of Ardnastaig",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",102
"103","36352. Who keeps the place now ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",103
"104","—It is occupied by a large farmer.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",104
"105","36353. What was the condition of the crofters in that place?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",105
"106","—They were fairly well off.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",106
"107","36354. What was the size of the croft which you had yourself?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",107
"108","—I cannot exactly tell the amount of the acreage.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",108
"109","36355. What stock did you keep ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",109
"110","—I kept five cows.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",110
"111","36356. A horse?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",111
"112","—We had no horses.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",112
"113","36357. Sheep ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",113
"114","—We had a few sheep.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",114
"115","36358. Why were there no horses; was the place so rough that a horse could not work it?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",115
"116","—The place was so very rough and the ground so soft that horses could not work on it.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",116
"117","36359. Of all the places round about you, is it that farm of which you spoke that you think most suitable to enlarge your holdings ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",117
"118","—-Yes, that is the only place.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",118
"119","36360. And you think it is very suitable ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",119
"120","—Yes; it is quite close beside us—just marching with our present crofts.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",120
"121","36361. Would it increase the arable land as well as the grazing land?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",121
"122","—Yes.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",122
"123","36362. And if you got it, is that what you would do with it?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",123
"124","—Yes. As our crofts are so small, we would convert what was convertible into arable land.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",124
"125","36363. Do you think you or your neighbours would be able to provide the necessary stock if you got such a bigger croft ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",125
"126","—I think we have plenty of stock already although we got the land. We would like to keep the two calves, because we have the two cows.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",126
"127","36364. You would like to have the two cows with followers?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",127
"128","—Yes, we would like to have the followers along with the cows.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",128
"129","36365. And you think your rent just now is high enough to cover the extended holding?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",129
"130","—Yes, we do.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",130
"131","36366. So that you have sufficient stock at present?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",131
"132","—Yes.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",132
"133","36367. And you think you have also sufficient rent?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",133
"134","—Yes.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",134
"135","36368. So that you could quite easily enter into possession if you got the ground upon these conditions ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",135
"136","—Yes.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",136
"137","36369. Even that croft would not support a family? Is there any other work going on ? What work are you engaged in in addition to the croft ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",137
"138","—No, very little, unless the adjoining farm will employ lads and lasses now and again.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",138
"139","36370. How do you occupy the time that is not taken up by the croft ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",139
"140","—We just go and work wherever we can.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",140
"141","36371. Do the people go away from home to work for wages?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",141
"142","—Yes, they sometimes get work on the adjoining estate, and perhaps go home to their own house at night.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",142
"143","36372. And that, along with the crofts, is the way they earn their livelihood ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",143
"144","—Yes.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",144
"145","36373. And even supposing you got this addition, you would still have to continue working, only you would be better off?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",145
"146","—Yes, only we would expect to be better off.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",146
"147","36374. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",147
"148","—There are ten people you say in Bunavullin ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",148
"149","—Yes.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",149
"150","36375. Have they only got one room each?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",150
"151","—Yes.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",151
"152","36376. Are the houses all in a row —stuck together?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",152
"153","—Yes.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",153
"154","36377. So, supposing a man had six or seven of a family, he must put up with one room ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",154
"155","—Yes.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",155
"156","36378. Do they pay the rent direct to the landlord or to the principal tenant ?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",156
"157","—They pay their rent to the proprietor'] they have nothing to do with the tenant.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",157
"158","36379. Professor MacKinnon.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",158
"159","—There is one John Stewart represented in the valuation roll as paying £15. Does he occupy only one room?",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",159
"160","—John Stewart does not pay any rent, if he does not pay the feu for the house. He is quite in a different condition from those I have spoken about, so far as the arable land is concerned, but his stock goes on our",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",160
"161","hill, of which he is entitled to a share.",601,"Alexander Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",161
