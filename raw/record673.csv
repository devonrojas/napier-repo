"1","JOHN FORSYTH, Factor for Balnagown (61)—examined.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",1
"2","40181. The Chairman.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",2
"3","—You have got a statement you desire to make in connection to what occurred yesterday ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",3
"4","—Yes, as to what was said by one of the Bonar delegates. I do not know that there is great need for my addressing you on this occasion, and in doing so I simply desire to make clear to your Lordship and the other Commissioners some things which I do not think the delegate Alexander Campbell made plain to you at Bonar. Alexander Campbell has only been a rent-payer on the Balnagown estate since 1871 (see his offer for croft). Previous to this date he was a sub-tenant to the late Dr Gordon, who held the farm of Badvoon and Kincardine, and who brought him on to the Balnagown property. I understand about 1868, Dr Gordon had besides Alexander Campbell thirteen sub-tenants, not thirty or forty as stated by him. On the expiry of Dr Gordon's lease, and at the time these farms were let to Mr Anderson, the then sub-tenants were continued in their holdings at the rent they now pay, £27, 5s. At the time I had not the smallest difficulty in arranging the rents with them. I had no complaints then of the rents being too high, and Alexander Campbell's statement to your Lordship and other Commissioners was the first I ever heard, with one exception. One tenant complained that his rent was too much; this was about six months ago. Neither had I any difficulty at the time in satisfying these tenants that they were better without sheep ; they consented to want them without any pressure on my part; and I am satisfied, after the experience I have had, that on that particular ground they are better without them still. If these tenants at any future time, are in a position to stock the whole of the hill, it might then be a question for reconsideration. If the crofters on the Balnagown property in Kincardine are too high rented, I assume the responsibility so far as it can be laid on my shoulders. I blame no one except that the crofters must take their share of it in their not having at the proper time complained of the rents they were asked to pay and willingly agreed to pay. Notwithstanding  the present complaint, I have no hesitation in saying, that if these holdings were to let now, I could not only let them at the present but an increased rent.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",4
"5","40182. There were two complaints brought before us prominently in connection with the farms occupied by Mr Anderson. One complaint was that the tenants had been prohibited from keeping sheep upon a piece of ground on which they had been formerly allowed to keep sheep, and that when they were deprived of this convenience there was no reduction made on their rent. It was also stated that they might have continued to keep the sheep there, if a fence had been put up between them and the farmer ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",5
"6","—It would not have paid to put a fence up there, and the piece of ground they allude to is not suited for sheep.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",6
"7","40183. The farmer says that the sheep upon the crofters' ground molested his farm by going across the marsh, and that it would have been impossible for him to have continued to occupy the farm if the sheep of the crofters had not been prevented coming over ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",7
"8","—That was so.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",8
"9","40184. Well, when the sheep were put off and when the farmer was relieved of this claim, was his rent increased at all ? Did he pay anything additional for this convenience ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",9
"10","—I forget whether he paid any increase or not when he took the farms. I cannot answer that question, but I rented him at what I thought fair value for the farm, and I acted in the same way to the crofters.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",10
"11","40185. But did he pay anything more to the proprietor in consequence of being relieved of the neighbourhood of the crofters' sheep ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",11
"12","—I think it is likely he would. ",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",12
"13","40186. He paid you something more ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",13
"14","—I think so. ",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",14
"15","40187. Was any portion of the increase paid by the farmer removed from the crofters ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",15
"16","—No, their rents were the same, with the exception of a few shillings. I think a few shillings were taken off each of them, to the best of my recollection. I think the delegate stated yesterday that",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",16
"17","his rent was £4, 5s. and he formerly paid £4, 13s.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",17
"18","40188. How long would the fence have been if a fence had been put up between the two parties ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",18
"19","—Over two miles.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",19
"20","40189. What is the expense of putting up a wire fence, supposing the proprietor to have his own wood, which I presume is the case with you ? What would be the expense per mile of putting up a wire sheep fence?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",20
"21","—I think it would have cost about Is. per yard. A good bit of it would have required to be iron altogether, as it was on rocky hill ground.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",21
"22","40190. That would be altogether £170 ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",22
"23","—Yes.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",23
"24","40191. What is the rent of the farm?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",24
"25","—The rent of the two farms is Badvoon £105, Kincardine £111, 5s. 6d.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",25
"26","40192. Then the rent of the two farms concerned in this case was about £216 ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",26
"27","—Yes.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",27
"28","40193. Do you consider it would be a very extraordinary outlay on the part of the proprietor to fence a farm from its neighbours with a wire fence of this value—at an expense of £170?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",28
"29","—I think under the circumstances it was an unnecessary outlay, because the ground the crofters had was unsuited for sheep.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",29
"30","40194. But they do not seem to have considered it was unsuited for sheep. At least they complain ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",30
"31","—I had no difficulty in arranging with them, not the slightest, at the time. I can show you Campbell's offer for his place if you wish to see it.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",31
"32","40195. What was the increase which the farmer paid in consideration of being relieved for the molestation of the crofters' sheep ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",32
"33","—I cannot answer that question.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",33
"34","40196. Was it anything considerable? Was it £20?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",34
"35","—Very possibly it was. I could answer that afterwards, but I cannot do it now. (see Appendix A. LXXIII)",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",35
"36","40197. Does it seem to you quite equitable to take an increased rent from a farmer in consequence of an advantage granted to him at the expense of others, and not to give the others some appropriate compensation?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",36
"37","—I don't think I took advantage of either the one or the other—either the tenant or the crofters. I acted between the two as fairly and justly as I could.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",37
"38","40198. And the crofters made no complaint at the time ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",38
"39","—No.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",39
"40","40199. When deprived of the liberty of keeping sheep, do you think they were able to keep more cattle and horses ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",40
"41","—-No doubt of it, but the ground is not suited for sheep in summer. Sheep would not live on the",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",41
"42","ground they complain of.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",42
"43","40200. In the other case there was a fence put up between the farm occupied by Anderson and the adjacent tenants, but in putting up a piece of ground was withdrawn from them, and added to the tenant ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",43
"44","—Allow me to explain that Dr Gordon held those farms and brought the sub-tenants on to the ground, and in making this arrangement with him I did the whole thing to the best of my ability. Mr Anderson put up a fence to keep them off a particular part of the ground, but at his own expense.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",44
"45","40201. He told us he put it up at his own expense, and he enclosed a piece of ground which formerly belonged to them ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",45
"46","—No, these crofters never claimed any right to that bit of ground.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",46
"47","40202. I understood the farmer to tell us they did ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",47
"48","—I did not hear him, and if he said so I am certain it was a mistake.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",48
"49","40203. Then in either case the crofters were not deprived of anything ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",49
"50","—No, the crofters were entirely on the Kincardine ground, not on the Badvoon ground at all.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",50
"51","40204. As a general statement, can you say that during the period of your management there has been no consolidation of farms at the cost of the small tenants ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",51
"52","—None whatever.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",52
"53","40205. No ground has been taken from small tenants, and added to large farms'?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",53
"54","—None whatever. There have been one or two cases of crofts being added to one another where a family had died out, and there was nobody to succeed, in order to make larger ones.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",54
"55","40206. How long ago is it since these transactions took place ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",55
"56","—In 1871.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",56
"57","40207. Has any ground upon the estate in the time of your management been turned into a deer forest?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",57
"58","—Yes,",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",58
"59","40208. Was any portion of the ground turned into a deer forest taken from the small tenants ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",59
"60","—None whatever. It was taken from the large sheep farm.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",60
"61","40209. Do the small tenants complain of the injury inflicted on them by the deer ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",61
"62","—No, they do not. The deer are very far from them.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",62
"63","40210. Is the deer forest fenced?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",63
"64","—No.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",64
"65","40211. Do you receive complaints from any quarter of ravages committed by the deer ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",65
"66","—None, except from our own shepherds. The sheep farm is in the proprietor's hands, and one shepherd particularly complains of the deer meddling with his croft.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",66
"67","40212. What is the system pursued on the Balnagown estate with reference to reconsidering, and raising it may be, the rent of the small tenants ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",67
"68","—Each case is considered individually by itself. It depends on how long the tenant has been in the place, and what he has done for the place.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",68
"69","40213. Is that done upon the death of the occupier or done from one stated period to another?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",69
"70","—It is not done at any stated period. Each case is considered by itself.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",70
"71","40214. From time to time?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",71
"72","—From time to time.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",72
"73","40215. Has it any connection with the death of the occupier ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",73
"74","—No, I cannot say it has.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",74
"75","40216. Has the rental of the small holders been increased during your time?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",75
"76","—A little, but not much. I cannot say what proportion; but not much.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",76
"77","40217. Has the rent of the large tenants been increased?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",77
"78","—Yes, it has.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",78
"79","40218. Has there been a considerable remission of rental on the large tenants within the last few years?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",79
"80","—None at all. I may mention, to give you an idea how we acted—and this has reference to Strath Carron—that the acreage of arable land in Strath Carron crofts in 1808 was 175 acres; in 1851, 229 ; increased 54; being an increase of fifty-four acres of arable land by twenty-nine tenants in forty-three years. The acreage in 1863 was 238 acres, being an increase of nine acres between 1851 and 1863, and a total increase in fifty-five years by twenty-nine tenants of sixty-three acres, equal to an average of two acres twenty-seven poles improved by each of the twenty-nine tenants in fifty-five years. Some of them improved more and some of them improved less.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",80
"81","40219. When you fix the rent of the arable ground on the small tenant is that done by a valuer, or by an expert, or by yourself ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",81
"82","—I have done it I have relet the whole of the Balnagown property without the slightest trouble, and with great pleasure to myself. There have not been half a dozen farms advertised for public competition since the estate came under my management.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",82
"83","40220. When ground is improved by the small tenants and brought under proper cultivation, what is the average rental of the arable ground ? ",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",83
"84","—The average rental of this Strath is about 20s. per acre. ",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",84
"85","40221. That has been land redeemed from the moor and brought into the condition of arable?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",85
"86","—Yes, since 1808.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",86
"87","40222. It becomes worth £1 per acre?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",87
"88","—Yes, in this situation. In some situations it would not be worth so much.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",88
"89","40223. In the recovery and improvement of land in that way, what is the system pursued by the proprietor ? Does the proprietor contribute in any degree to the operation ? Does he supply tiles ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",89
"90","—Sometimes. There is no special rule. It is a matter of arrangement in each case. Sometimes tiles are supplied, and sometimes it is done by the tenants paying interest. I don't know what was the system in those old times, but I understood that the proprietor gave wood to help to build the houses in those days.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",90
"91","40224. What is the system now1! Does the proprietor give wood?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",91
"92","—Sometimes.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",92
"93","40225. And lime?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",93
"94","—Not lime. That was given many years ago, and the tenants paid interest. I don't know they repaid the lime, but they paid interest, and it was added to the rent. But the proprietor does not give wood now except by special arrangement.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",94
"95","40226. There is no general regulation?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",95
"96","—None.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",96
"97","40227. Mr Cameron.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",97
"98","—This farmer, Mr Anderson, stated that the crofters made more profit out of the new arrangement, by which he gave them a certain sum for wintering his hoggs, than they did under the old arrangement, when they had sheep themselves. Do you confirm that statement?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",98
"99","—Yes. My experience of that place since 1871 is that they are in a better position without sheep than with them.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",99
"100","40228. He stated that whereas their rent paid to the landlord amounted to between £3 and £4, they received from him for wintering about threefourths of that back again; so they really sat for about 25s. apiece ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",100
"101","—The delegate Campbell's rent is £4, 5s.; Mr Anderson gives him £3, leaving his rent at £ 1 , 5s.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",101
"102","40229. And you think that by keeping sheep themselves they would not derive so much profit as they do now from this wintering arrangement?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",102
"103","—I do not think they would.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",103
"104","40230. You corroborate Mr Anderson on that point?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",104
"105","—I do.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",105
"106","40231. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",106
"107","—Is there only one deer forest on the Balnagown estate ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",107
"108","—Yes.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",108
"109","40232. When was it constituted?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",109
"110","—In 1872. The ground was cleared of sheep in 1872. I should say there are two. It is let to two tenants.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",110
"111","40233. What is the acreage of the whole ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",111
"112","—I think about 40,000 acres, but that is not all cleared of sheep. There are sheep upon a portion of",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",112
"113","both places.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",113
"114","40234. You stated, in answer to the Chairman, that these had been made out of sheep farms. Had the ground been ever in possession of small tenants ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",114
"115","—I don't think so, because that ground before a sheep was put on to it was under deer, and in going over it I can see few or no traces of where crofters had been.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",115
"116","40235. Can you give us any idea of the extent of the ground in question between these small tenants in Kincardine and Mr Anderson that would require two miles of fencing? How many acres would there be?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",116
"117","—Some 3000 or 4000 acres, roughly.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",117
"118","40236. Have you not heard over and over again that there is a great demand on the part of crofters for additional grazings ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",118
"119","—Yes, I have.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",119
"120","40237. And you are still prepared to say that the loss of those 4000 acres is really no loss to them ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",120
"121","—They never had it.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",121
"122","40238. Did they not possess it?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",122
"123","—No, they never possessed it.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",123
"124","40239 Where did the 200 sheep pasture?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",124
"125","—They wandered over the whole place without any authority on the part of the tenant to keep them.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",125
"126","40240. Then they were really not deprived of anything?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",126
"127","—No, they are not deprived of the acreage of the hill, for pasture on the hill. They never had any right to it.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",127
"128","40241. You did not state that before?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",128
"129","—I had not the opportunity.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",129
"130","40242. You say they never had any right to it?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",130
"131","—They never had. They never paid any rent for it.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",131
"132","40243. Are there not cattle at this very moment upon it ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",132
"133","—Yes, but only on a portion of it. These crofters have each his own house and his own bit of arable ground, and a piece of pasture ground in connection with it. That is their whole holding.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",133
"134","40214. And the other was merely a tolerance—this great quantity?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",134
"135","—Yes, the other was merely a tolerance.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",135
"136","40245. Let us suppose it was merely a tolerance. Then Mr Anderson comes and complains of their sheep. Why did not you give them an opportunity to fence themselves off, if they wished to retain the land ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",136
"137","—Because they did not ask to retain it. They departed from it without any trouble. Besides, I did not think they had capital to carry on these farms. They never said they had stock to carry on these farms. If they had said so the matter would have been considered.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",137
"138","40246. Would it be considered yet?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",138
"139","—I have said so in my statement. If these tenants at any future time are in a position to stock the whole of the bill, it must then be a question for reconsideration.'",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",139
"140","40247. You gave us the increase of the new land taken in by the tenants since 1808; what was your object in making that statement?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",140
"141","—I thought I was asked to explain about it. I understood some of the Strath Carron tenants were to be examined about it yesterday, and I wanted to show how the increase was made.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",141
"142","40248. Do you consider that increase was proportionate to what it might be in that long period ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",142
"143","—I don't think it is out of the way.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",143
"144","40249. Then you did not make that statement in any way as showing the people bad been indolent for the last fifty or sixty years ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",144
"145","—No, I did not make it with that intention at all.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",145
"146","40250. Would you explain as briefly as you can why you say that, in your opinion, the people are better off without the sheep than having them ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",146
"147","—Because the ground near to their own ground is unsuited for sheep. Sheep would not thrive on it in summer.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",147
"148","40251. But they themselves are very sorry they are not able to keep sheep ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",148
"149","—Well, it is matter of opinion.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",149
"150","40252. Are you a sheep farmer yourself ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",150
"151","—I manage a sheep farm.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",151
"152","40253. Is sheep farming not profitable?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",152
"153","—-It has been more profitable than it has been these last few years.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",153
"154","40254. I suppose all you mean is, that in this particular case, from the situation and lie of the ground, it is not advantageous for these tenants to have sheep ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",154
"155","—Entirely so.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",155
"156","40255. You do not say it is disadvantageous for small tenants to have sheep ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",156
"157","—No, by no means; it was entirely with reference to this particular piece of ground.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",157
"158","40256. Were you at all aware that there was any dissatisfaction, since this transaction was carried through, among those twenty-five tenants?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",158
"159","—None whatever. I never had a complaint from one of them on the subject, except one tenant who complained about six months ago that his rent was too dear. His rent was £2, 10s. for a house and two acres of ground.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",159
"160","40257. Are you in the habit of seeing those people occasionally or some of them ?",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",160
"161","—I see them every year. I have been in every house on the property and am personally acquainted with every tenant on the estate.",673,"John Forsyth","Ross-shire, Dingwall",161
