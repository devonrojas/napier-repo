"1","Rev. JOHN M'LEAN, Minister, Bracadale (43)—examined. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",1
"2","6392. The Chairman.",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",2
"3","—You desire to make a statement?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",3
"4","—I have no particular statement to make, but I am ready to answer any questions.",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",4
"5","6393. How long have you been minister here?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",5
"6","—Six years in January last ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",6
"7","6394. You have heard generally what the delegates have said to-day, and you have heard particularly what they have said about the deterioration of their condition in connection with the repeated evictions and consequent overcrowding ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",7
"8","—Yes. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",8
"9","6395. Do you agree generally with their statements?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",9
"10","—Yes, I do. I ascribe their poverty primarily to the smallness of their holdings. I believe they will be better off if they have larger holdings. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",10
"11","6396. Have you yourself observed, since you have been here, a deterioration in their physical condition ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",11
"12","—No. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",12
"13","6397. What part of the country do you belong to ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",13
"14","—I am a native of North Uist. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",14
"15","6398. Do you think generally that the people are better clothed and better fed than they were at the earliest period of your recollection ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",15
"16","— Well, I cannot say in reference to this parish. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",16
"17","6399. But generally in the island ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",17
"18","—Not in my native parish. I think they are as well off there as they used to be. I cannot say anything except for the past six years with reference to the people here, but I think the want of milk is a very great want in this parish, and is felt severely. I think it is a very great hardship to rear children without milk. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",18
"19","6400. Do the people then, in reference to their condition here, compare favourably with the people of your native place ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",19
"20","—Decidedly they do. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",20
"21","6401. Do you think that if the proprietors were inclined to enlarge their boundaries and give them greater access to the soil, many would avail themselves of it?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",21
"22","—I believe many would. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",22
"23","6402. Are you aware there is any considerable amount of money brought into the parish by the younger people in the form of wages ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",23
"24","—A great deal. All the young people leave early in spring —at least as soon as they are done with their tillage. They go south, and earn wages there, and send a great deal of money to support their parents and friends at home. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",24
"25","6403. Do you think that would help their parents to take up land and improve it, and build their houses?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",25
"26","—Yes, I think so. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",26
"27","6404. Have you observed here, in the course of your ministry, any solicitude on the part of the proprietor or his factor for the welfare and improvement of the people generally—any active interest?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",27
"28","—I think they are both very indifferent about the circumstances of the people in this parish, —both the factors and the proprietor, they are distant. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",28
"29","6405. Have you any other suggestion of your own, besides the enlargement of the croft, towards the greater welfare of the people ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",29
"30","—No. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",30
"31","6406. How do you find the children? Do you find them miserably dressed—so ill-dressed that they are incapable of going to church or school? ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",31
"32","—Yes, they are very poorly clad, and that interferes very much with their education. Whenever we find fault with parents for not sending their children forward to school, the reason they assign for their absence is that they cannot keep them clad, that they have not shoes, and that if the weather is anything severe they cannot send them on to school. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",32
"33","6407. Do you think that they make that an excuse ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",33
"34","—There is a great deal of truth in it. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",34
"35","6408. How are the paupers looked after in this parish ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",35
"36","—There is an inspector appointed in the parish to look after them, and there is a parish doctor. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",36
"37","6409. Do they do their duty actively and industriously ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",37
"38","—I think they do, so far as I know. I hear no complaints. It is very seldom I see any one before the board with any serious complaints in reference to the administration of the poor law in the parish. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",38
"39","6410. Do they make tolerable allowances for the paupers, or are they parsimonious ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",39
"40","—They are the most liberal board in Skye, I believe. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",40
"41","6411. Have you observed any sign of increasing poverty this year or last year ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",41
"42","—This year, of course, people are hard pressed, but that is general all over Skye, and for that part all over the west coast. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",42
"43","6412. Have they obtained some useful relief ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",43
"44","—Yes, they have. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",44
"45","6413. Have they got seed generally, and potatoes?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",45
"46","—Yes, they got a little, and we have a surplus,—I mean the parochial committee,—to relieve the poorest, in the shape of meal through the summer, for perhaps the real pinch is scarcely on yet. We kept a reserve fund. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",46
"47","6414. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",47
"48","—Are the people generally a very quiet, peaceable, well-behaved people ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",48
"49","—Remarkably so. I don't think there have been two criminal cases in the whole parish since I became minister of it. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",49
"50","6415. Have you ever been able to visit the island of Soay ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",50
"51","—I have been once there visiting the school, as a member of the school board, and I beg to say, in the absence of my friend the Free Church minister, that Soay is not neglected to such an extent as M'Caskill said. There is a catechist resident always in the island, and it is very seldom the island is without the services of a missionary; and very often a licentiate of the Free Church I may say the whole of the people in the island are Free Churchmen.",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",51
"52","6416. So far as you know about that island, do you concur in the views of the delegate, that it would be wise they should be removed ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",52
"53","— Well, the soil is very poor; it is a very poor island. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",53
"54","6417. The Chairman.",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",54
"55","—Have all the people been baptised; have they the advantage of the sacraments of the church ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",55
"56","—Well, in former years baptism was neglected. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",56
"57","6418. In Soay?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",57
"58","—There were two adult individuals belonging to the island of Soay that I baptised. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",58
"59","6419. Is the holy communion administered there?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",59
"60","—No, but they come here. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",60
"61","6420. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",61
"62","—You wish to make some explanation about one of the delegates, saying that no assistance was given by the clergy in arranging for the selection of delegates ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",62
"63","—In reference to the election of delegates, it was simply this, that four or five individuals, cottars from the township of Cuilore, called on me and asked me to preside at their meeting. I told them, first of all, it was a very simple thing, and that I thought they were quite capable of selecting delegates themselves. I then drew up a paper for them calling a meeting, which two or three of them signed. At the same time I declined to preside at the meeting, because I was under the impression that there was another gentleman in the parish who would be far more acceptable to the parish in general It was not at all owing to being ashamed or afraid to attend, for it was a lawful meeting, but I was under the impression that another gentleman would be got whose presidency would be more acceptable to the people—I mean Mx Ross. It was all owing to a misunderstanding. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",63
"64","6421. Sheriff Nicolson.",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",64
"65","—Where does the doctor live?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",65
"66","—At Carabost. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",66
"67","6422. If there were a sick person requiring medical attendance, how long would it take to send for him from Ose ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",67
"68","—That would depend on the weather. . ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",68
"69","6423. If it were a beautiful day ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",69
"70","—A boat could do it in two or two and a half hours, but it is a very long route by the road. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",70
"71","6421. Supposing you had to send round by road ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",71
"72","—It would take three and a half hours from Ose to Carabost. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",72
"73","6425. Do you think any great inconvenience is caused by the doctor residing at Carabost ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",73
"74","—I think it is the most central place now. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",74
"75","6426. Then, speaking of the people being well behaved, was there any policeman here when you came first ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",75
"76","—No. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",76
"77","6427. Are there any now ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",77
"78","—There are two. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",78
"79","6428. What were the two sent for ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",79
"80","—One was sent two or three years ago, and the other recently. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",80
"81","6429. Do you think two persons are required to preserve the peace of the parish of Bracadale ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",81
"82","—No, I think it is a superfluity. I think we could do very well without them. ",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",82
"83","6430. Is it in any way disagreeable to the inhabitants that the police force has been increased ?",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",83
"84","—Not so far as I know. I have never heard a complaint.",123,"Rev John Mclean","Skye, Bracadale",84
