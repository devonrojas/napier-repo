"21","—Right Honourable Gentlemen, Being called upon to narrate grievances from Laxay, the township in which I reside, I herewith take the liberty to say, in the first place, that my age is 63 years; that I came to Laxay at the age of eight, along with my father and other ten crofters, who were driven away with all their belongings from their thriving and agreeable holding at Aline and Park, in which they knew nothing beyond prosperity and happiness. Park, which nature seemed to mean for man, with all its arable lands, hill pasture, and bays of the sea, offering grand opportunities of comfort, as a reward to human industry, was quite unprecedentedly relieved of the inhabitant population of twenty-eight townships. To the perpetrators of such deeds the discontentment and bitter feelings of the fugitive inhabitants appeared as nothing at all compared to the peculiar pleasure they enjoyed from the fact that now the sheep and the fleet-footed deer could graze on the meadows and on heaths impiously depopulated. Some of these men were evicted to America, others scattered here and there at home, on small patches of land in the less-thought-of districts. A crofter having the misfortune of falling under the displeasure of factor or ground officer, however innocent the poor man may be, has not the ghost of a chance of getting along uninterrupted. As an illustration of this, I can say I knew of a person, a crofter in this village, who was compelled to abandon three different holdings and three different new houses, which he built in the sweat of his brow, on three consecutive years, without even a kind word in the way of aid or compensation for his labour, time, and expenses. There is another man, still living here, who underwent a similar disagreeable process. The deer and sheep began their chase upon him at three or more different places at Uig, drove him over to Carloway, and he had been no sooner there than the land was considered too good for man, at least for such as crofter population, and so to make room for sheep the poor man was turned out, and the said individual had to make another painful flitting. When we came to Laxay, as already referred to, we found seven crofters there. Then it was divided into seventeen crofts, at the rent of £80. Soon, however, £ 10 more was added to the rent of the village, and five shillings road money and one shilling for hens, which is looked now upon as natural rent. There are now twenty-nine crofts, the latest of which is placed in our pasture way. The land is now almost entirely exhausted by continual ploughing; this, with high rent and taxes in some cases, together with subdividiugs of crofts, make the prospects of the crofter very dark and hopeless. Mr M'Kay, the present chamberlain, has committed very gross injustice upon a sister of my own, who with peculiar industry kept her croft in good order and paid rent regularly, cruelly turned her out of the croft six years ago, and would not accept its rent from her. She was blind and helpless ; they never inquired after her. I had to take her to myself when the land she had was given to another man (see Appendix A. XL). It is high time Parliament should make an investigation as to the cause or causes of grievances amongst Her Majesty's most loyal subjects in the Highlands, and especially in Lewis, where factor and ground officers pretend to be in absolute and arbitrary power, and labour hard to keep people in perpetual awe of their own importance (not of course denying them; their proper places). We herewith suggest, respectfully, some of the remedies necessary for our well-being and comfort. To obtain the arable land and hill pasture, now under sheep and deer, at fair rents, fixity of tenure, and compensation for improvement. Park, which keeps 11,000 sheep and an innumerable amount of deer, would of itself, if given to our enormous number of cottars and others, meet a vast deal of what is needed.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",21
"22","17387. You state that you were eight years old when you came to Laxay, and now you are 63, so, I suppose, the evictions of which you speak took place fifty-five years ago ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",22
"23","—Yes; about that time.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",23
"24","17388. Did all the evictions take place at that period, or have any evictions taken place subsequently?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",24
"25","—There were other townships that were cleared since that time within the farm of Park, Oronsay, Cleater, Stiomara, and Shealdinish. A voice from the crowd says forty-five townships, but I am not prepared to say there were more than twenty-eight.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",25
"26","17389. But have there been any evictions since the date at which these twenty-eight townships were cleared fifty-five years ago ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",26
"27","—I can speak to four townships that have been cleared since that time, and that are now included in the farm of Park.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",27
"28","17390. Do you know how many families were removed from these four townships?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",28
"29","—I lived far away, and I cannot give accurate information upon that matter, but there are many here who can.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",29
"30","* See Appendix A, XL.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",30
"31","17391. Do you know where they were removed to?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",31
"32","—Some of them came, to Crossbost, some to Grimshader, and some to Balallan. ",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",32
"33","17392. Were these people removed to places where there were already crofters, or to lands in the possession of tacksmen ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",33
"34","—Crossbost was under a tacksman at the time. Balallan was under crofters. Grimshader was also under crofters. One of them was a large farm at the time, and the other two were under crofters.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",34
"35","17393. Were most of the people removed to land that was under tack or to land held by the crofters ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",35
"36","—The greater portion of them went to the place that formed the large farm—Crossbost.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",36
"37","17394. Was the land to which they were removed greater in extent than the land from which they were taken?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",37
"38","—The land to which they were removed was less in extent.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",38
"39","17395. Are you sure that the land to which they went was less in extent than that from which they came ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",39
"40","—Quite sure.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",40
"41","17396. As to the quality of the land, which do you consider was the best quality?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",41
"42","—I was not of age to judge as a tenant myself at the time, but the land that they left was roomy enough. It yielded good crops, and there was plenty of room for good stock.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",42
"43","17397. Are you acquainted with the land to which they were removed?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",43
"44","—Yes.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",44
"45","17398. What is the quality of that land?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",45
"46","—The land is good enough of its kind, but then it is so thickly peopled that it cannot do good as it is used.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",46
"47","17399. How many years ago was this?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",47
"48","—Off and on about forty years ago.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",48
"49","17400. Have there been any removals since then?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",49
"50","—Yes, I can remember of some tenants coming in upon ourselves where I lived from the other side of the country, over in Carloway, a place called Dallmore.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",50
"51","17401. Has the population of Laxay increased of late years?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",51
"52","—Yes.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",52
"53","17402. From what cause has that increase arisen ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",53
"54","—The increase is due partly to the natural increase of the place and partly to people coming in from the outside.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",54
"55","17403. Have any come in recently from the outside?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",55
"56","—Probably about ten years ago was the last.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",56
"57","17404. Where did they come from ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",57
"58","—From Balallan.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",58
"59","17405. Do you know why they left Balallan?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",59
"60","—The man was not able to get a place there.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",60
"61","17406. There was only one man?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",61
"62","—Yes.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",62
"63","17407. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",63
"64","—Can you give us the names of the twenty-eight townships that you referred to us as having been cleared out of Park, or as many as you can ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",64
"65","—There was a place called Lemora that was cleared and afterwards reconstituted with crofters; Oronsay, Stiomara, Eesgin, Bunish, Cean-loch-Alich. It is only one that would be particularly acquainted in that district that could recite all the names. Seaforth, Stromas, Sgealadale. I can scarcely give any more; I was but young at the time. John Smith, a previous witness, could give almost the whole of them.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",65
"66","17408. Have you any idea of the number of families that would be in those twenty-eight townships ? Would they amount to over a hundred ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",66
"67","—I cannot tell; people were not so numerous then as they are now. They were spread over the place.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",67
"68","17409. Would you say there were fifty families ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",68
"69","—I should think there would be more than that.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",69
"70","17410. The Chairman.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",70
"71","—You mention a case of a crofter in this village, I presume the village of Laxay, who was compelled to abandon three different holdings and three different new houses, which he built in three consecutive years, without getting any compensation. What was the name of that crofter ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",71

"78","—Yes, he was in Seaforth first.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",78
"79","17414. How long is it since he was in Seaforth ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",79

"81","17415. Don't you know how long he was in Seaforth?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",81
"82","—Then the next year he was sent to Ardentrean.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",82
"83","17416. Do you know whether be was sent by the factor, or did he flit there as a squatter?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",83

"85","17417. You are certain that he got leave to build a house?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",85
"86","—Yes, he got leave to build a house.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",86
"87","17418. From whom did you hear this?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",87
"88","—From himself.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",88
"89","17419. And he said he had leave to build in these places ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",89
"90","—Yes.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",90

"93","17421. Where is he living now ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",93
"94","—In Laxay.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",94
"95","17422. How long is it since he was driven from Uig ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",95
"96","—He came to our parish when Chamberlain Mackenzie lotted the place.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",96

"101","17425. Did he get no compensation for the house that he built at Dallmore ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",101
"102","—I cannot tell anything of that, but I know that he came into our place in room of some of those who went to America. It was by an act of high-handedness that he was removed from Dallmore.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",102
"103","17426. The rest of the people of Dallmore went to America, did they not ?",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",103
"104","—Some of them did ; some did not.",318,"George Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",104
