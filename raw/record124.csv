"10","6434. To whom did you apply?",124,"Donald Mcleod","Skye, Bracadale",10
"11","—I spoke to the factor, and we wrote to the landlord—M 'Leod; but we did not tell M'Leod the place in which we were—we thought he knew it himself already. ",124,"Donald Mcleod","Skye, Bracadale",11

"48","6452. Then, have you given up the matter ?",124,"Donald Mcleod","Skye, Bracadale",48
"49","—We have not given up the matter; we expect it. ",124,"Donald Mcleod","Skye, Bracadale",49
"50","6453. How many concurred in thi3 application?",124,"Donald Mcleod","Skye, Bracadale",50
