"1","MURDO NICOLSON, Farmer, Loanfearn—examined. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",1
"2","2842. The Chairman.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",2
"3","—How long have you had your present farm ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",3
"4","— About eighteen years since I got it. My fathers were there for the last 500 years, in the same farm, and the same house. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",4
"5","2843. Under Lord Macdonald's family ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",5
"6","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",6
"7","2844. Has your farm been enlarged during your time?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",7
"8","—Yes, three crofts have been added to it. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",8
"9","2845. Were those crofts added to your farm by your own desire, or by your landlord's desire ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",9
"10","—Well, two of them by my own desire, and the other was vacant when I came home. I was abroad. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",10
"11","2846. Professor Mackinnon.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",11
"12","—You know the whole district perfectly well ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",12
"13","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",13
"14","2847. How many schools are there ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",14
"15","—Two, one here and one at Valtos. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",15
"16","2848. New schools?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",16
"17","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",17
"18","2849. Built under the new Act?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",18
"19","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",19
"20","2850. Are there separate school boards for Kilmuir and Stenscholl?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",20
"21","— Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",21
"22","2851. Is there a compulsory officer in this district ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",22
"23","—No, he lives in Kilmuir. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",23
"24","2852. Does he visit here?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",24
"25","—Now and then. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",25
"26","2853. And there are two schoolmasters settled here ever since the schools were built ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",26
"27","—Yes; one here and one at Valtos. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",27
"28","2854. Are all the children within easy reach of one or other of the two schools?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",28
"29","—Yes; in summer time, but not in winter. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",29
"30","2855. Do you know the population of the place ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",30
"31","—I do not know the population of this place; but the population of the upper part, which contains the upper school, is about 450 people. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",31
"32","2856. And how many children attend the school at the present time ? ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",32
"33","—I dare say there will be between twenty and thirty. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",33
"34","2857. Do you consider that a good attendance ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",34
"35","—No, far from it. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",35
"36","2858. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",36
"37","—Is that here or at Valtos ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",37
"38","—At Valtos. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",38
"39","2859. Professor Mackinnon.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",39
"40","—Is it much the same here?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",40
"41","—I think it is the same so far as I can make out. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",41
"42","2860. How do you account for the children not attending the Valtos school better than that ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",42
"43","—I do not know what is the cause of it. About this time of the year poor people are so busy, and if there is any child that can herd and help the parents, they will keep them at home when they are sowing, and planting potatoes. After this the children herd the cattle, and the men who are able to work will go south to earn their living and support their families. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",43
"44","2861. And the children herd the cattle ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",44
"45","—Yes, there is nobody to look after them except the old people",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",45
"46","—old men and women. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",46
"47","2862. And these cannot herd cattle?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",47
"48","—No. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",48
"49","2863. And then, when the winter comes, the school is too far away ? ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",49
"50","—Yes, and there are bad roads, and burns and the like of that. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",50
"51","2864. But, allowing for all that, do you think the children attend school properly ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",51
"52","—No. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",52
"53","2865. And how do you account for that ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",53
"54","—That is a thing I cannot make out. If the children were pressed to go to school, they would go. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",54
"55","2866. But they are not ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",55
"56","—No. As long as they wiU do anything about the place, the parents will not send them to school. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",56
"57","2867. Unless they are compelled ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",57
"58","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",58
"59","2868. Does the school board meet here occasionally?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",59
"60","—Not very often. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",60
"61","2869. Do you think the board are perfectly weU aware of this irregular attendance ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",61
"62","—I think so. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",62
"63","2870. The officer is quite aware of it?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",63
"64","—Yes, and every one of the members of the board is aware of it. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",64
"65","2871. Do you know if the Board ever press the children to go in any way ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",65
"66","—They spoke to the parents, but there was no use in that. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",66
"67","2872. You know the law gives them power now to punish the parent if he does not send his child to school. They never tried that mode ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",67
"68","— No. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",68
"69","2873. Do you think they ought ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",69
"70","—That is a thing I cannot say ; I do not think the parents will ever send the children to school till they try that. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",70
"71","2874. Then I suppose you think they ought to try it as soon as possible ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",71
"72","—In some cases. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",72
"73","2875. The chillren are clever enough if they were sent to school?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",73
"74","— They are as clever as children in any part of the world, if they got a good education. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",74
"75","2876. Even as things are, are they getting a better education than they did ten or twenty years ago ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",75
"76","—I do not think it. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",76
"77","2877. There are better schoolmasters?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",77
"78","—Better schoolmasters, but I do not think there are better scholars. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",78
"79","2878. There are school rates ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",79
"80","—We are paying school rates, and we werenot paying them in the old time. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",80
"81","2879. And good schoolmasters ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",81
"82","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",82
"83","2880. More of them ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",83
"84","—Yes, more of them certainly. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",84
"85","2881. And you think there are not better scholars?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",85
"86","—No, I do not think it. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",86
"87","2882. How is that?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",87
"88","—Well, I cannot make out. I have seen many people from Skye going to the army, and some got to high offices in the army; but you will not see any youngsters now going into the army, and that shows the people are falling back in Skye. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",88
"89","2883. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",89
"90","—Do you mean in spirit ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",90
"91","—No, not in spirit. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",91
"92","2884. Professor M'Kinnon.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",92
"93","—In circumstances ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",93
"94","—In circumstances. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",94
"95","2885. Do you think, if the people were better educated, that would be one inducement at least for some of the people leaving the country, and so relieve the pressure of population?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",95
"96","—I daresay some of the young men would be better to leave the country. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",96
"97","2886. But there are plenty of young men ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",97
"98","—Well, there are a great many of them leaving the country; but we have plenty of land in Skye if it was given to us. We have thousands upon thousands of acres in Skye under sheep. I have sheep myself. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",98
"99","2887. You heard the whole evidence that was given here to-day ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",99
"100","— Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",100
"101","2888. That the people are getting worse off?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",101
"102","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",102
"103","2889. You quite believe that ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",103
"104","—I am quite sure of it. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",104
"105","2890. You know the district thoroughly well ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",105
"106","—From one end to the other.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",106
"107","2891. And the reason they give themselves is, that the crofts were reduced—especially the pasture ground",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",107
"108","—and subdivided, and the rents raised ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",108
"109","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",109
"110","2892. Do you also consider that the chief cause?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",110
"111","—Yes. Another is that when the people here got poor, Captain Fraser had a rule—and it was a good rule—that every tenant should pay his rent at the term. Well, poor people could not pay, and they had to go to the bank to raise the money, and perhaps they would have to pay interest to the bank, and to the man who helped them to get the money out of the bank. Perhaps 2s. 6d. or 3s. in the pound would have to be paid to that man. This was ruining the poor people. Perhaps one would borrow £1 0 this year and the next year for twenty years borrowing it that way. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",111
"112","2893. That, of course, was the consequence of the previous inability to Nicolson, pay?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",112
"113","—Yes, lest the people would be moved off the estate. But Captain Fraser did not know anything about that. He was getting his rent from the tenants, but he did not know they were getting it out of the banks or anything of that kind. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",113
"114","2894. And that went on very much?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",114
"115","—Yes, very much till lately. Now they cannot get money out of the banks at all. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",115
"116","2895. What would be your remedy for the whole matter?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",116
"117","—Well more lands and lower rental. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",117
"118","2896. Plenty of land?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",118
"119","—Plenty of land. There are some patches of land on these crofts which have been turned for the last fifty or sixty years every year. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",119
"120","2897. I suppose neither you nor I are old enough to remember forty years ago. At that time was there a rotation of crop ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",120
"121","—Well, I recollect forty or fifty years ago very well. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",121
"122","2898. Was there rotation of crop among the crofters at that time ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",122
"123","— Yes, there were plenty of potatoes and plenty of corn. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",123
"124","2899. But were they not cropping the land every year then ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",124
"125","—No. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",125
"126","2900. Were they letting it out now and then ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",126
"127","—Yes. Most of them had full crofts then, and now there are three families in most cases on each croft. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",127
"128","2901. And were they letting the laud out fallow a year now and again, then ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",128
"129","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",129
"130","2902. You remember that yourself ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",130
"131","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",131
"132","2903. Now, supposing they did get the land, how could they stock it ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",132
"133","—Well, I do not know,—if they would get money from Government. The poor people cannot stock it now, but they wiU never get on if they do not get more land. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",133
"134","2904. Do you think that would be a reasonable or probable thing to ask Government for money to stock the land ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",134
"135","—Well, I think so. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",135
"136","2905. Has that ever been done anywhere?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",136
"137","—Not here; they were not in want of it till now. I recollect when I was a little boy every farmer would kill a cow at Martinmas, and also kill a sheep now and again, and use their own eggs and everything, but now they are selling everything to pay the rent. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",137
"138","2906. I suppose, when you were a boy, you remember perfectly well the homes of the people here ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",138
"139","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",139
"140","2907. Their food and clothing?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",140
"141","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",141
"142","2908. Bed clothes ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",142
"143","—Bed clothes, and everything they wore. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",143
"144","2909. And their food was very much better >",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",144
"145","—Well, it was strong Highland food that was used, and it is far better to raise strong-built healthy people, and a nice thing to have. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",145
"146","2910. That is to say they had meal, potatoes, and milk?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",146
"147","—Yes, and fish and beef and mutton, and plenty of butter and cheese. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",147
"148","2911. And to-day ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",148
"149","—Very little of these. If a man has a wedder or two he will have to sell them. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",149
"150","2912. And what do they have in its place?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",150
"151","—Nothing at all. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",151
"152","2913. The Chairman.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",152
"153","—Tea?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",153
"154","—No, what would they do with tea? There is no beef, no milk, nor anything else; and people going to the south and getting into the habit of drinking tea, when they come to Skye ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",154
"155","may drink tea in Skye. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",155
"156","2914. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",156
"157","—What is your rental ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",157
"158","—£80. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",158
"159","2915. Are you upon Kilmuir estate or Lord Macdonald's?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",159
"160","—Upon Major Fraser's estate, marching with Lord Macdonald. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",160
"161","2916. Has your rent been raised since Major Fraser's time ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",161
"162","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",162
"163","2917. Very much?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",163
"164","—Yes, quite enough. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",164
"165","2918. Would you have any objection to state what it was when you got the property?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",165
"166","—I left home in 1840, and went to Australia. My father then was paying £25 a year clear rental. There was no road money about that time. Now I am paying £80 a year, but there are three crofts added to Loanfearn. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",166
"167","2919. But since the three crofts were added, has your rent been raised? ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",167
"168","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",168
"169","2920. Professor Mackinnon.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",169
"170","—What was the rent of the three crofts when your father paid £25 ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",170
"171","—When I got the two crofts they were £5 , 5s. each, and the one croft was £5 ; that is £15, 5s. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",171
"172","2921. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",172
"173","—That would make £40?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",173
"174","—Yes ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",174
"175","2922. And it is £80 now?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",175
"176","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",176
"177","2923. The Chairman.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",177
"178","—Have you had the same reduction that other people had 1",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",178
"179","—-Yes; Major Fraser gave me £20 down for the last two years. In the receipts it is only from year to year. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",179
"180","2924. Sheriff Nicolson.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",180
"181","—Have you a lease of Loanfearn ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",181
"182","—No, I never had a lease. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",182
"183","2925. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",183
"184","—Nor your forefathers before you?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",184
"185","—No. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",185
"186","2926. Professor Mackinnon.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",186
"187","—Did you ever ask a lease?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",187
"188","—No. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",188
"189","2927. Do you wish to have it ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",189
"190","—No. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",190
"191","2928. Why not ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",191
"192","—I do not know. If I were as young as I am old, I would not stay long in Skye. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",192
"193","2929. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",193
"194","—Are you still improving the lands ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",194
"195","— Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",195
"196","2930. Are you afraid of your rent being still more raised ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",196
"197","—I do not think they can raise it higher than it is. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",197
"198","2931. You have heard some of the previous witnesses state, as a reason for not improving their crofts, their fear of the rents being raised, and of eviction; but you have no such fear ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",198
"199","—Not the least afraid. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",199
"200","2932. Because your rent is so high, that nobody else will give it ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",200
"201","—It will not pay me, or anybody else. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",201
"202","2933. Might it not be added to Duntulm 1",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",202
"203","—It is too far from Duntulm. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",203
"204","2934. Or Monkstadt ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",204
"205","—It is too far from Monkstadt. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",205
"206","2935. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",206
"207","—Did you ever hear of a Government advancing money to stock farms ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",207
"208","—Not to small tenants. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",208
"209","2936. Or to large tenants?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",209
"210","—Yes, I believe Mr Martin, Snizort, got money in that way to fence. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",210
"211","2937. Fencing is a different thing, because the land remains; but what about stock ?•",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",211

"215","2938a. What proof would there be that the stock would remain ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",215
"216","— The Government could not mark the beast as a merchant does, and be there always beside it to see that it does not leave the place ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",216
"217","—I know that most of the people here to-day, if they do not get help from the Government, will never be able to do any good. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",217
"218","2939. Did you hear about the advances for meal and the marking of the beasts in security ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",218
"219","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",219
"220","2940. Do you know all about that ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",220
"221","—Yes. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",221
"222","2941. What do you think of it?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",222
"223","—if the merchant would allow the man to sell the beast again, he would sell the beast, and give the money to the merchant, and he has a right to do so. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",223
"224","2942. And is a fair price paid for the meal ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",224

"226","2943. But the price of the meal is not told to the man 1~No, but when the merchant buys the beast from the tenaut, perhaps the meal is in Glasgow, and perhaps the merchant does not know the price of the meal. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",226
"227","2944. Sheriff Nicolson.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",227
"228","—It was said recently in defence of a man tried before the High Court of Justiciary that it was a common practice for people here to sign the names of other people without asking their leave ; is that so ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",228
"229","—No, I don't think it is. I never heard of that being practised in Skye. If it was, it was forgery. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",229
"230","2945. It is not correct to say that it is common ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",230
"231","—It is not. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",231
"232","2946. The want of that road is a very great inconvenience and loss to the people of the district 1",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",232
"233","—The want of a road and a postman is a great inconvenience. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",233
"234","2947. Has there been any expenditure upon it for some time ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",234
"235","—No. Major Fraser finished it to Loch Mealt, and did not go further than that. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",235
"236","2948. As far as you are concerned, is the road useless ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",236
"237","—Useless, today. ",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",237

"252","2956. The Chairmnan.",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",252
"253","—You spoke of the Government advancing money for the purpose of purchasing stock. It seems to me very doubtful whether Government could do that, but it does seem possible Government might advance money for the erection of buildings and march fences. Do you think people would be able to take up new land if they were helped with the buildings and with the fences ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",253

"255","2957. Would it be a great advantage to the present race of crofters if their hill pasture were fenced off from the tacksmen ?",49,"Murdo Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",255
