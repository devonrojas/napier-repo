"5","6097. Have you been freely elected by the people of Carabost ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",5
"6","—Yes",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",6
"7","6098. Have you any statement to make on the part of the people of Carabost?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",7
"8","—I have to complain of their poverty and the miserable houses that they have. The families till they are grown up have to sleep in the same room. It is a sheer violation of human nature. Our meal mill has gone to ruin, and for the past twenty years there has not been a peck of meal ground in it. I remember being with my father waiting for a whole week to get my turn at the mil!. That was before the first potato blight. It is the prevalent opinion that we were grinding between 300 and 400 bolls annually in this parish previous to the first potato blight. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",8
"9","6099. The Chairman.",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",9
"10","—Do you mean the potato blight of 1836, or the other ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",10
"11","—Previous to 1846. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",11
"12","6100. Mr Cameron.",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",12
"13","—Are the houses at Carabost worse than the houses in other parts of the island ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",13
"14","—They are none of them better anywhere. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",14
"15","6101. But are they worse? You talk of families living in one room. Did not they do that in other places ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",15
"16","—I think they are. Most of them are very bad. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",16
"17","6102. You heard the witness who gave evidence about the shop and the goods which he sold to the people ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",17

"20","—Mostly about the same price. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",20
"21","6104. There was one item he was not asked about; what is the price of sugar ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",21
"22","—The average is 5d. for good crystallised sugar. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",22

"24","—I manage to make both ends meet. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",24
"25","6106. Do the people find it very difficult to pay the debts that are owing to you ? Have you many bad debts ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",25
"26","—Yes, a lot of them; but they cannot help it. As a rule, the cottars are as honest a people as are under the canopy of heaven, if they could be so. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",26
"27","6107. They may be honest, and yet poor?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",27
"28","—Yes, if they had the means. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",28
"29","6108. What is your opinion about the state of the people now compared with what it was when you first set up your shop?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",29
"30","—They are sinking more in debt. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",30
"31","6109. Still they seem to spend a good deal upon articles of groceries and similar articles ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",31
"32","—As a rule, tea and sugar, as they have no meal. Most of them have no meal, and that is the only thing they have to put down their morsel of bread. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",32
"33","6110. Do most of the people buy tea and sugar, and use it?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",33
"34","—Yes. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",34
"35","6111. You sell bacon and cheese?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",35
"36","—Yes. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",36
"37","6112. Do the people buy the bacon and cheese too?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",37

"39","6113. Where do the people get the money -which enables them to buy these stores ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",39
"40","—A lot of the money comes from the market towns, Glasgow and Greenock, and from manufacturing towns, and from people going to Mathieson. fishing and earning money. There is no money to be earned in Skye. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",40
"41","6114. Do they earn much money amongst the tourists - ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",41
"42","—No, there are very few tourists come this length. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",42
"43","6115. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",43
"44","—You have heard a previous witness speak about the evictions upon Talisker and Glenbrittle and Drynoch. There were two other large farms. Can you give any evidence about Ulinish and Ebost ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",44
"45","—Only what I heard. I heard about the evictions by Dr M'Lean and Talisker—that was called the Reign of Terror. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",45
"46","6116. We have heard of it, but I want you to tell of any people that have been removed from Ulinish and Ebost ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",46
"47","—I heard so, but I cannot mention particulars. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",47
"48","6117. Is there anybody here who can tell the particulars?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",48
"49","—There is a delegate here. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",49
"50","6118. Is there a Donald Cameron from Ulinish here?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",50
"51","—Yes. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",51
"52","6119. Can you give us any information about the evictions upon any other places in the parish except the three places mentioned ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",52
"53","—That is all I don't mind of any except what what was mentioned. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",53
"54","6120. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",54
"55","—You go back to the year 1846. You have always lived at Carabost?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",55
"56","—I was for some time absent from the country. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",56
"57","6121. How many people are there in Carabost now?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",57

"59","6122. How many families?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",59
"60","—There are ten or twelve families. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",60
"61","6123. How many families were there in 1846?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",61
"62","—Double that number. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",62
"63","6124. Then the evictions took place after that ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",63
"64","—There were no evictions after that, but evictions before that. The people flitted out of it after the potato blight. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",64
"65","6125. It was not on account of the evictions that they left, but on account of the potato famine ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",65
"66","—Yes, about Carabost. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",66
"67","6126. And that is the reason there is not so much demand for a meal mill ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",67
"68","—Yes, and the smallness of the crofts. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",68
"69","6127. When were the crofts made small ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",69
"70","—Upwards of forty years ago. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",70

"72","— Yes. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",72
"73","6129. I am talking of the year when you had to wait a whole week at the mill ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",73
"74","—That was before that. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",74
"75","6130. Then the want of the demand for a mill arises from this, that the people have left the country on account of the potato famine?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",75
"76","—Some of them. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",76
"77","6131. And others have had land taken from them since that time?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",77
"78","—Yes. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",78

"82","— Yes. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",82
"83","6134. Is that the cause why the population has decreased so much?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",83
"84","— Yes, and a lot went to Glasgow and Greenock and a great deal of them to the market towns. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",84
"85","6135. If there was a good mill here now would there be corn to grind at it ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",85
"86","—Oh, they raise no crop at all ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",86
"87","6136. As regards the houses, they are built by the people themselves ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",87
"88","— Yes. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",88
"89","6137. You are upon Talisker's ground?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",89
"90","—Yes. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",90
"91","6138. If they built a better house, would Talisker leave them in it?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",91
"92","— Yes, I don't know of any of them being turned out. A lot of remarks were made about John M'Caskill, but I was absent from the country at the time. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",92
"93","6139. But I am talking of those very bad houses at Carabost which you say are too small for a family properly to live in ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",93
"94","—Far too small. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",94

"96","—Yes, they would very soon improve them if they had the means. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",96
"97","6141. Then it is the want of means that prevents them building bigger houses ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",97
"98","—That is so. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",98
"99","6142. They are not afraid of being turned out of the bigger houses ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",99
"100","—No, for I improved my own, and I am not afraid of being turned out. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",100
"101","6143. And you have no hold of it?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",101
"102","—No more than I have of this church. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",102
"103","6144. The Chairman.",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",103

"105","—No, I don't think so. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",105
"106","6145. If they improved their houses, you don't think they would be asked to pay a higher rent ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",106
"107","—No, I don't think it. Their own neighbour may take a set of it, to give more money for it. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",107
"108","6146. Did you ever hear that the proprietor or the tacksman or any one had offered to assist the people in getting better houses?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",108

"113","— Never, to my knowledge; and I never heard anything about it. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",113
"114","6149. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",114
"115","—You stated, in reply to Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, that several people from some of the townships emigrated. Were these cottars or crofters ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",115
"116","—Cottars. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",116

"124","6153. Has it done any injury to the people in the district?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",124

"126","6154. Is any of the Carabost whisky drunk in that quarter?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",126
"127","—Not a gill. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",127
"128","6155. I suppose they cannot afford it?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",128
"129","—No, it is too dear. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",129
"130","6156. Where do they get their own whisky from?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",130

"135","6158. Are they people connected with the country, or are they strangers ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",135

"138","—Have you known or heard of the people of that district having been subjected to very considerable inconvenience, amounting to persecution, after the time of the Disruption ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",138
"139","—There was some little grievance of that kind at the time of the Disruption. ",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",139
"140","6160. What form did it take ?",118,"Alexander Mathieson","Skye, Bracadale",140
