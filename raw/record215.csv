"1","MALCOLM M'INNES, Crofter, Tighary (48)—examined.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",1
"2","12228. The Chairman.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected a delegate by your people ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",3
"4","—Yes.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",4
"5","12229. Have you a written statement to put in?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",5
"6","—Yes, this is my statement. ' Unto the Royal Commissioners on Highland Crofters. The Memorial of the Crofters in the Township of Tighary, Parish of North Uist, —Humbly sheweth, that at a meeting of the crofters it was unanimously resolved and agreed upon, that the following statement of the causes of their complaints should be handed to the Commissioners by one of the selected delegates, as a preliminary remark, that each and all of them have no cause of complaint against their present proprietor, because in his time he neither increased their rents nor evicted any person for arrears; nor have they any fault whatever to find with his judicious factor. In common with others on the estate, they complain that drainage money is still continued to be charged against them since 1848. Their principal grievance, however, is the smallness of their holdings, which are quite inadequate to support themselves and families in comfort; therefore, they would prefer that each of them should possess three crofts instead of one, which would enable them to have a regular rotation in cropping, because the tillage land is getting poor year by year from incessant cultivation, consequently is less productive, the chief manure used being sea-ware. Their horses then would be reduced by half the present number, which are weak in strength to carry cart-loads of sea-ware from the shore to the tillage land—a distance of two miles. To point out the scarcity and inferiority of grazing, a cow's grass only costs eight shillings a year. With respect to their rent, it was originally fixed in connection with the annual manufacture of kelp, which was fetching a high price at market by means of this labour. Rents were paid regularly, and  sometimes a supply of meal was given by the proprietor in advance, besides grazing was allowed to the horses employed till 1st August. In common with other townships on the west side of the island, Tighary had the privilege and right to the hill pendicle of Langash, for which, if restored, they would willingly pay a  reasonable rent to the proprietor, for it would be of considerable benefit for the purpose of improving the condition of their young stock of cattle previous to the July cattle market held at Lochmaddy. With respect to the Education Act, they find that the school fees are too high and difficult for some of them to pay quarterly. They would consider it expedient and proper that Gaelic should be taught in the public schools, in order that the children might be able to read the Bible in their mother tongue. Without the least doubt, there is plenty of arable and hill land in North Uist for the whole population, if properly and equitably divided; for by reference to the map of the island, as well as to the valuation roll, it can be clearly seen that the greater part of the best",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",6
"7","tillage and grazing land is occupied by a few tacksmen. We repeat the chief reform we stand in need of, viz., a larger holding of land, fixity of tenure, and remuneration for improvements. There are fifteen cottars in the township. They are certainly a great burden in various ways, and the sooner they get holdings for themselves the better for our interest. The delegates can corroborate the above statements.—Your memorialists will ever pray. We subscribe this document for ourselves and by authority of the rest of the crofters in this township.—Tighary, North Uist, 25th May 1883.—JOHN M'LEAN, JOHN M'INTYRE, JOHN M'QUEEN.'",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",7
"8","12230. Was this document read to and understood by the rest of the crofters who do not sign it?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",8
"9","—Yes, it was read both in Gaelic and English.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",9
"10","12231. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—You have stated in this paper that Gaelic should be taught in the schools. I presume, therefore, there is no Gaelic taught in the schools of North Uist ",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",10
"11","—Not in our place anyhow.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",11
"12","12232. Has the teacher any Gaelic ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",12
"13","—Plenty of it.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",13
"14","12233. Would there be any difficulty do you think in getting teachers that could teach Gaelic in the whole of North Uist ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",14
"15","—I don't think there would be any difficulty.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",15
"16","12234. You state that there are fifteen cottars upon this place. How many crofters are there altogether? —There are twenty crofts, but a few are double.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",16
"17","12235. How did that arise? Was it from vacancy or eviction, or how did people manage to get more than one?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",17
"18","—Some of them went voluntarily to America.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",18
"19","12236. Would you explain about this drainage money which you say has been going on since 1848? Were you told at the time it was first put that it would cease after a number of years ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",19
"20","—There was talk to that effect any way—that it would cease at the end of twenty years, but I am not certain about that.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",20
"21","12237. Did you make any representation to the factor that it should now cease after the twenty years were over ?—I never spoke to him myself, but some told me that they did speak to him. ",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",21
"22","12238. What was the answer?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",22
"23","—His reply was that he himself was paying it yet to the Government.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",23
"24","12239. Which factor was that?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",24
"25","—Mr Macdonald, the present factor. ",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",25
"26","12240. You complain that the whole pendicle of Langash has been taken from your town, and if restored you would willingly pay rent for it. To whom was Langash given ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",26
"27","—It was taken away long ago, before I was of much sense, but I am not very sure that the crofters ever had it, but it was attached to this township. I believe it was taken away before the place was divided into crofts.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",27
"28","12241. Who has it just now?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",28
"29","—Mr Macrae, tenant of Langash.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",29
"30","12242. Is that a large farm?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",30
"31","—No, it is not large.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",31
"32","12243. What rent would you be willing to give for it if you got it back ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",32
"33","—We cannot say, but a reasonable rent.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",33
"34","12244. You are willing to pay a reasonable rent?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",34
"35","—Yes.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",35
"36","12245. Do you know what the total rent of Mr Macrae's possession is?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",36
"37","—No, I don't know.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",37
"38","12246. You say here that there is plenty arable and hill land in North Uist for the whole population if properly and equitably divided, and that the best part of the tillage and grazing is occupied by a few tacksmen. Would you mention the names of some of these tacks ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",38
"39","—The place where I was born, on the other side of the country, is under sheep by a nonresident tenant.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",39
"40","12247. What is the name of it?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",40
"41","—The tenant is Widow Macdonald. There are two farms—Grenetote and Dramauen. In these two places",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",41
"42","there were twenty-four crofters.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",42
"43","12248. What became of these twenty-four crofters?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",43
"44","—They were sent away to America, the whole of them except one, and my father.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",44

"46","—Mr Shaw, the factor.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",46
"47","12250. Was the property then Lord Macdonald's?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",47
"48","—Yes.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",48
"49","12251. How long is it since this happened?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",49
"50","—Forty-two years.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",50
"51","12252. Did these people go of their own will, or was pressure brought upon them to go to America ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",51
"52","—The proprietor sent them away.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",52
"53","12253. Now, can you name another suitable place?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",53
"54","—Upon the other side of it again there are Arisa and Avore.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",54
"55","12254. Who possesses them now ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",55
"56","—Balranald.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",56
"57","12255. Were there any people put out of them?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",57
"58","—Every one of them.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",58
"59","12256. How many?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",59
"60","—I cannot tell bow many.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",60
"61","12257. Were they considerable?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",61
"62","—Yes.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",62
"63","12258. What became of them?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",63
"64","—They went to America, the most of them.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",64
"65","12259. In the same way, under pressure?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",65
"66","—In the same way.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",66
"67","12260. About the same time?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",67
"68","—Yes, about the same time, or perhaps before it.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",68
"69","12261. Can you name any other places ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",69
"70","—Remisgarry, Clachan, Scoloba, Balmaconnon, Caolas, Bal-vic-pheall.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",70
"71","12262. Who now possesses Remisgarry?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",71
"72","—Balranald.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",72
"73","12263. Clachan ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",73
"74","—Balranald.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",74
"75","12264. Scoloba ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",75

"77","12265. Caolas ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",77
"78","—The factor has it,",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",78
"79","12266. You have mentioned three places—Remisgarry, Clachan, and Scoloba Is there any other place from which people have been dispossessed and of which Balranald is the tenant ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",79
"80","—I am not certain about others, but I am certain about those I have named.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",80
"81","12267. How many were put out of Remisgarry ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",81
"82","—I cannot say. There are some here who know these matters better than I do.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",82
"83","12268. And out of Clachan ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",83
"84","—I cannot tell.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",84
"85","12269. Scoloba ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",85
"86","— I cannot tell how many were sent out of any of these places.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",86
"87","12270. Would you mention the name of anyone who knows?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",87
"88","—John Morrison, who was brought up in that place.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",88
"89","12271. Do you know any particulars about Caolas? Is that a farm that would be suitable for crofters ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",89
"90","—I know Caolas would be a suitable place for crofters. They were there before.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",90
"91","12272. How many were turned out of that place?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",91
"92","—I cannot say, but John Morrison knows.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",92
"93","12273. And Bal-vic-pheall ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",93
"94","—I cannot tell you how many were sent away from that.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",94
"95","12274. Who has got Bal-vic-pheall now?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",95
"96","—The factor has it.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",96
"97","12275. Can you mention any other large tacks besides those you have named that would be suitable ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",97
"98","—Yes, Sollas.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",98
"99","12276. Can you tell us about the Sollas evictions ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",99
"100","—I can give some account of them, but there are delegates here who could tell more about them than I can. John Morrison is one and Donald M'Queen is another.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",100
"101","12277. Mr Cameron.—What rent do you pay for your croft?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",101
"102","—£6, and perhaps a few shillings more.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",102
"103","12278. How many acres of arable ground have you?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",103
"104","—I cannot tell how many acres. It is not very large. Perhaps there should be from seven to eight acres.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",104
"105","12279. How many cows have you?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",105
"106","—We are not able to keep stock at all, although we have them. They are really dying of hunger. Our summing is four cows.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",106
"107","12280. How many cows have you got?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",107
"108","—I have four.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",108
"109","12281. How many young cattle?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",109
"110","—Three small stirks.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",110
"111","12282. How many horses ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",111
"112","—Two.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",112
"113","12283. How many sheep ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",113
"114","—I smeared twenty-eight sheep, but probably a good number of them are dead by this time.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",114
"115","12284. Has this been a bad winter for them ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",115
"116","—Yes, it was a bad season, and there is a great scarcity of grass. It was sea-ware that kept them alive.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",116
"117","12285. Is that the ordinariy size of croft that your neighbours have?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",117
"118","— Yes, it is the average size; some larger and some smaller.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",118
"119","12286. Is the rent about the average rent?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",119
"120","—Yes, the rent is also the average ; some greater and some smaller.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",120
"121","12287. Do the crofters complain of the rent being too high ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",121
"122","—The rent of the croft must be large when we are not able to make our living out of it.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",122
"123","12288. Do all the crofters in your township have sheep?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",123
"124","—Yes, more or less.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",124
"125","12289. And all of them have horses?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",125
"126","—Yes, every one has a horse.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",126
"127","12290. There is no such thing as what we have heard of in some of the other islands—women drawing the harrow, or that sort of thing ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",127
"128","—No.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",128
"129","12291. Have there been any evictions since the present proprietor came into possession ",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",129
"130","—I never saw any one sent away from our township, but one who was very far back in arrears of rent.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",130
"131","12292. Is there any general feeling of alarm lest the people should be removed as they were in former times? —I never experienced any such feeling.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",131
"132","12293. I see in this paper that the crofters ask for fixity of tenure—do you know what that means ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",132
"133","—We mean by the phrase fixity of tenure that in the event of our getting more land, as we ask for, we would be able to work upon it, and we would be settled down upon it without any fear that we would be removed from it. ",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",133
"134","12294. Do you wish fixity of tenure in your present holding, or would you restrict that to the possibility of getting a larger holding?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",134
"135","—I don't ask for it for my present holding; we never thought of that.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",135
"136","12295. Have you never considered whether a long lease might not answer your purpose, provided you got larger holdings?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",136
"137","—We would likfully better that the tenure should be as long as we would pay the rent, and as long as people would behave themselves properly. We would fully prefer that to any lease.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",137
"138","12296. Is there any work going on in the island?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",138
"139","—I am not aware of anything but repairing roads, and a little kelp made out of the drift weed since the other kelp ceased to be made.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",139
"140","12297. Do the people fish at all ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",140
"141","—Not in our place, unless there may be a few who fish lobsters now and again. Our coast is so wild and exposed that it is not suitable for fishing.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",141
"142","12298. Then what I understand is that though you are not dissatisfied with your present holdings, you wish to have such large holdings as would enable you to live as farmers on a farm, and not be dependent upon labour",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",142
"143","to maintain your families?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",143
"144","—That is it exactly—the very thing we want—that we could make a living out of our crofts by our own labour. We don't want to be gentlemen.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",144
"145","12299. Is there any land suitable for the purpose of enlarging your holdings which is adjacent to the township you represent ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",145
"146","—No, crofters surround us on every hand.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",146
"147","12300. Then how would you propose to enlarge your holdings without shifting the crofters altogether to these large tacks ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",147
"148","—The big tacks are there ready for us getting a share of them.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",148
"149","12301. Would half of the people be ready to migrate altogether to the big tacks, so as to leave the present township to be divided among the remainder ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",149
"150","—Yes, quite willing.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",150
"151","12302. Have many of the people in your township got sufficient money to stock these larger holdings ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",151
"152","—I believe there are not many. They could not very well be in such a position, but if justice was done to the present stock we have, we could perfectly well take up larger holdings, for the stock really would require twice the amount of croft in order to support it properly. The cows have no milk, and they are not properly fed. ",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",152
"153","12303. In other places we have had a request made for Government aid to stock the larger holdings they ask for, but as I understand from you the people here would not require that—they would be able to do it themselves ",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",153
"154","— Oh yes, they would be glad to get it. Although their own stock would increase in a few years so as to stock the place completely, still they would have a hard struggle for these few years without such aid.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",154
"155","12304. Would they be able to build houses for themselves, provided that at the end of the lease, or whatever term their occupation lasted, they got compensation for their houses ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",155
"156","—They would be very glad to do so.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",156
"157","12305. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—Where do you get the cow's grass?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",157
"158","—In order to keep up our stock we always require to keep young beasts. It sometimes happens that one may have a cow over-much and another may have a cow short, in which case the man who is short of a cow is able to rent out a cow's grass to the one who has a cow over-much. ",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",158
"159","12306. When was it that Tighary was divided among crofters and Langash taken from it ?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",159
"160","—I am not perfectly certain. We came to it ourselves forty-two years ago, but I believe it is nearly sixty years since it was laid out.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",160
"161","12307. Who held Tighary and Langash before it was lotted?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",161
"162","—The parish ministers had it.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",162
"163","12308. As a glebe?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",163
"164","—They rented it ; it was not part of the glebe.",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",164
"165","12309. Do you know where Balmaconnon is situated?",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",165
"166","—It lies between Bal-vic-pheall and Clachan, but though I know the district, there are so many names that perhaps I could not describe the particular locality. ",215,"Malcolm Mcinnes","North Uist, Loch Eport",166
