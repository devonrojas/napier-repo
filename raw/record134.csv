"1","JOHN M'SWAN, Crofter and Fisherman (52)—re-examined.",134,"Norman Mcleod","Skye, Glendale",1
"2","7166. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",134,"Norman Mcleod","Skye, Glendale",2
"3","—You gave evidence at Dunvegan?",134,"Norman Mcleod","Skye, Glendale",3
"4","—Yes, I was asked especially about the practice of the tenant paying the arrears due by his predecessor.",134,"Norman Mcleod","Skye, Glendale",4
"5","7167. The Chairman.",134,"Norman Mcleod","Skye, Glendale",5
"6","—Who selected you to appear in place of Donald M'Lean ?",134,"Norman Mcleod","Skye, Glendale",6
"7","—I was co-delegate with Donald M'Lean.",134,"Norman Mcleod","Skye, Glendale",7
"8","7168. Have you any written statement from the people of Skiniden?",134,"Norman Mcleod","Skye, Glendale",8
"9","—No.",134,"Norman Mcleod","Skye, Glendale",9
"10","7169. Would you make a verbal statement?",134,"Norman Mcleod","Skye, Glendale",10
"11","—I have not much to say, and I am not going to say much. It is only eleven years since I went to Skiniden, and you know that each  township has marches, and every lot is the same, and the fourth part was taken from the march at Skiniden by the factor who settled it This factor was Norman M'Raild, and his father had it for £80, and the poor people are now paying £88 for it, while the fourth part of the land has been taken away from them.",134,"Norman Mcleod","Skye, Glendale",11
"12","7170. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",134,"Norman Mcleod","Skye, Glendale",12
"13","—Who has that fourth part?",134,"Norman Mcleod","Skye, Glendale",13
"14","—M'Raild himself. Another thing is, that one of the crofters in the place had about half an acre of the best part of his lot taken by M'Raild, who added it to his own holding, while the man is paying still for it. The factor also took from the man the upper part of his lot and gave it to a herd, so that the man has only the middle of his lot, and he can neither go to the hill nor to the sea-shore from his lot without trespassing on somebody else, unless he goes over the rocks. Again, every crofter was promised a ton of seaware. They did not get the half of that, and they were under the necessity of buying sea-ware off M'Leod of M'Leod's property, but last year the sea-ware was ahowed them by Tormore. There is no reason for my saying much. I have seen a great deal of the high-handedness of the landlords and the factors since I remember.",134,"Norman Mcleod","Skye, Glendale",14
