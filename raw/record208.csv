"1","DONALD M'DONALD, Crofter, Torlum (71)—examined.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",1
"2","12001. The Chairman.—Have you a statement to make to the Commissioners ? What is the complaint of the people here ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",2
"3","—I have to complain that in the days of Clanranald there were two large crofts which belonged in those days to the townships of Torlum and Griminish, and that when the present crofts of these two townships were allotted to the holders of them, these two large crofts were taken from them and added to the neighbouring tack of Nunton, and this has conduced to greatly press us for room in these two townships. On account of this we are behind in food and in fodder.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",3
"4","12002. When the two large crofts were added to Nunton, what became of the crofters who lived on the two large crofts?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",4
"5","—There were no crofters upon that particular strip of land, but it did belong to the townships already mentioned.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",5
"6","12003. Professor Mackinnon.—How many crofters are there in Torlum now ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",6
"7","—Twenty-two crofts. There are eighteen crofts in Torlum, and one tenant has four crofts besides those eighteen. ",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",7
"8","12004. There would have been twenty-two full crofts, only eighteen have eighteen full crofts and one has four?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",8
"9","—Exactly.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",9
"10","12005. What is the rent of a full croft?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",10
"11","—There are some at £7, 10s. some at £6, some at £5, and some at £4.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",11
"12","12006. And what is the stock ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",12
"13","—I pay a rent of £6, 4s.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",13
"14","12007. What stock are you allowed to keep ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",14
"15","—I have four cows and three little heifers, and I have also three stirks, a horse, a mare, a year-old, eight sheep, and a few hoggs.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",15
"16","12008. How long have you been paying rent in Torlum ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",16
"17","—My father was paying rent for seventy years, and I myself have paid rent upwards of forty years.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",17
"18","12009. You were then in the township when these two crofts were taken from it ",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",18
"19","—Yes.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",19
"20","12010. Do you remember if the rent was reduced when the parks were taken away ? Was it made less ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",20
"21","—It was a common before the township was lotted, and then the common was taken away from them, and a new valuation made of the rents at. that date, and these two were valued as well, and those two were joined to the neighbouring tack of Nunton.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",21
"22","12011. Does your township march with Nunton ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",22
"23","—Very nearly so.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",23
"24","12012. Who is between you ",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",24
"25","—The turner.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",25
"26","12013. Is the turner in the township?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",26
"27","—Griminish.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",27
"28","12014. Who occupies that farm of Nunton?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",28
"29","—It was occupied by the late Norman M'Donald, and is now occupied by his widow.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",29
"30","12015. Then, about this large piece or common, are you marching with that piece of common ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",30
"31","—Very near it.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",31
"32","12016. But I presume that all the crofters in the island have a right to graze upon that common, whether they march with it or not ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",32
"33","—Every one may send his stock as he pleases to the big common.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",33
"34","12017. Is it not regulated at all how many each is allowed to send there ",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",34
"35","—There is no regulation as to numbers.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",35
"36","12018. Is it occupied in winter as well in summer?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",36
"37","—It will not support any creature in winter.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",37
"38","12019. It is only used as summer pasture?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",38
"39","—Just so.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",39
"40","12020. Do you send cows there as well as horses and sheep?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",40
"41","—No horses at all are sent there. It is chiefly sheep, and occasionally we send our cattle there also.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",41
"42","12021. Are milk cows ever sent there?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",42
"43","—Yes, for portions of each day, some days.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",43
"44","12022. That is, I suppose, by those who are near it, but do those crofters that are far away send their milk cows there ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",44
"45","—No, not those far away.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",45
"46","12023. Only those who are near?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",46
"47","—Only those that are near",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",47
"48","12024. So that they can easily milk them there without staying out on the common themselves ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",48
"49","—Yes.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",49
"50","12025. Then what is it that the people of Torlum complain of?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",50
"51","—The smallness of the land.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",51
"52","12026. You don't complain that your own rent is too dear?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",52
"53","—Yes, I do complain that it is too high. I stated to the factor that he valued the eight crofts in my neighbourhood too highly, my own croft being among the eight.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",53
"54","12027. But your complaint is more against the size of the croft than against your rent?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",54
"55","—Yes ; much more.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",55
"56","12028. How many suitable crofts would Torlum make ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",56
"57","—One man has a fourth part of the township, and he complains that he cannot make a living on it.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",57
"58","12029. So that even if you had four crofts, you have scarcely much hope that you would be very comfortable? ",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",58
"59","—If I even had two I think I would be better off than I am.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",59
"60","12030. But the man that has four complains very hard ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",60
"61","—Yes, so he does.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",61
"62","12031. His complaint, I suppose, must be that the rent is too high, not that the croft is too small ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",62
"63","—He complains of both.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",63
"64","12032. Except this farm of Nunton, of which almost all the delegates have spoken, is there any other large farm in the island suitable for subdivision into crofts ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",64
"65","—Yes, there are.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",65
"66","12033. What are their names ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",66
"67","—The island of Wia.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",67
"68","12034. Who occupies it?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",68
"69","—It belongs to the farm of Nunton.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",69
"70","12035. I was asking, except the farm of Nunton?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",70
"71","—I don't know of any.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",71
"72","12036. That is to say, Nunton takes up all the good land except what the crofters have ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",72
"73","—Nunton is the best land.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",73
"74","12037. Do you think that that farm, broken up, would be able to give reasonable crofts to all the people of the place ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",74
"75","—It would not supply the half.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",75
"76","12038. Then how do you propose to deal with the people?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",76
"77","—The island of Wia is now a portion of Nunton farm, formerly part of the two townships of Torlum and Griminish. This island maintained a stock of three hundred sheep, fifty heifers, and thirty horses. From that stock you can conceive the island is good. So that if those two townships already mentioned received the island back, along with the original strip of ground adjoining Nunton, our difficulty might be solved. ",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",77
"78","12039. Perhaps that might do for these two townships, but what of all the other townships that have been asking for a piece of Nunton ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",78
"79","—The proprietrix at present has in her own occupancy two vacant tacks called Ledistrom and Cregston. If the crofters who are burdening Linicleit should be removed there, this would remove the pressure upon Linicleit. ",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",79
"80","12040. Do you think there are other places on the estate to accommodate all the people that are burdening the other townships as well ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",80
"81","—I believe there are plenty of places.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",81
"82","12041. So that the whole population, and not merely the half, could be accommodated ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",82
"83","—Plenty of places.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",83
"84","12042. How could you provide stock for those who would have to be removed to those two tacks, if you say they are already so destitute ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",84
"85","—That is a large case. They have no stock.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",85
"86","12043. You would not like that the estate should be without large farms altogether here and there, would you?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",86
"87","— I would not wish them to possess so very much as they do now.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",87
"88","12044. But you would like that there should be some few large holdings in the place ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",88
"89","—That would require to be in every country—a difference in the size of the holdings.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",89
"90","12045. The people would be all the better off by the large farms as well as the crofts, some of them being larger and some smaller? ",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",90
"91","—Yes, a poor man cannot go to a big holding.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",91
"92","12046. A previous delegate stated, about the price of meal here, that the price of oatmeal was 50s. to £ 3 per load. Is that the case?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",92
"93","—I believe it costs about 50s.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",93
"94","12047. If you got it from Glasgow direct, what do you pay for a bag of oatmeal in Glasgow ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",94
"95","—£2, 4s.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",95
"96","12048. What is the freight of the steamer to this place ?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",96
"97","—2s. 6d. per bag altogether. It costs 3s. 6d. for the carriage of it to my house; so that the total cost of a bag of meal, when it reaches my house, is £ 2 , 8s.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",97
"98","12049. Do you pay less in Glasgow for a bag of oatmeal1?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",98
"99","—I paid 22s. to a Glasgow merchant for one boll of oatmeal.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",99
"100","12050. I suppose the merchant is a family grocer that supplies meal, as well as other things, on credit?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",100
"101","—No credit longer than fourteen days, or over three weeks.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",101
"102","12051. I suppose you are quite sure that is the case about the meal?",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",102
"103","—I am perfectly certain.",208,"Donald Mcdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",103
