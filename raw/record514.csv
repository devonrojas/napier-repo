"11","30366. Have you got a memorial for them to present?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",11
"12","—Yes. ",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",12
"13","—Statement by the Kirkton Tenants, parish of Lochalsh. Between 1847-49, nine families emigrated from Kirkton, and at the latter date the township was divided into eight shares, of which Mr David Logan got five. The whole rent wa3 £85, including hill pasture of Altan Ban, near Pait Monar, on which all our stock, with the exception of the milch cows, were grazed for the summer half-year. This arrangement subsisted till 1852, when Mr Logan left, and the eight shares were changed to four. At the same time Altau Ban was taken from Kirkton, and was given to the late Mr Mitchell of Attadale, who was gradually forming a large sheep farm out of the grazings belonging to other townships; but there was no reduction of rent. Besides this, a considerable portion —about the fifth part —of our home hill pasture was taken from us and added to the Balmacara Hotel farm, or Iteraig, for which a reduction of £11, 11s was allowed. This continued till 1859, when a new arrangement was made by joining Old Glebe to Kirkton, and dividing the whole anew into six shares. Old Glebe, whilst in occupation of Sergeant Macrae, paid a rent of £30, but when added to Kirkton charged £40. In the consideration of outlays by proprietor for building houses, byres, &c, the rent at the same time was increased to £20 each, or £120 for the whole township. Then afterwards, in 1862, £ 10 each additional rent was laid on us in the name of interest for improvements, rising the rent to £ 30 each, or £180 in all, besides road money and poor rates. It may be stated that, according to an entry in our rent books, the total amount certified to have been expended in these improvements is £1261, 12s. 10d. We continued paying at this rate till Martinmas 1881, when we got a reduction of £6 each, or £36 for the whole, which leaves us paying now £24 each, or £144 for the whole farm. Our present stock consists of 250 sheep of all kinds, 18 milk cows, and 6 horses. Any young cattle we keep or wish to rear, we have to send every year to summer to the Isle of Skye. As may be understood from the foregoing figures, we have experienced very great difficulty in making a living at all out of the place; in fact, many of us could not have held at all, if not assisted by friends, or having means otherwise; and as for those who had no such means or assistance, it has been an arduous and long-continued struggle for existence for years back. In order to make this clearer, we have only to mention the rent and stock of some of our neighbouring big farms by way of comparison. The farm of Balmacara pays a rent of £320, and is understood to carry a sheep stock between 1000 and 1500, besides cattle and horses. Auchtertyre pays £200, and carries between 700 and 1,800 sheep, with cattle and horses. Conchra pays £325, and has a stock of about 1500 sheep, with the usual accompaniments of cattle and horses, we wish to point out that these big farms support only one family each, whilst our small one, besides supporting six families as tenants, is also burdened with other four families of cottars and squatters. We also regard it as another great grievance, that at least three-fourths of the best land of our native parish is in the occupation of six large sheep farmers and one deer forest; and we believe it would be for the benefit of the people generally if the land was more equally divided. Having now stated our grievances, we beg respectfully to mention to the Royal Commission that the following are what we require in order to enable us to live in a fair state of comfort and contentment:—",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",13
"14","(1) That our rent be reduced to what it was before the improvements were made; ",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",14
"15","(2) Fixity of tenure as long as we pay a fair rent; ",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",15
"16","(3) Compensation for any improvements we might make in the event of removaL All the tenants concur in this statement, with one exception.—DONALD MATHESON, DUNCAN MACRAE, delegates.'",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",16
"17","30367. Mr Cameron.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",17
"18","—You state your rent was reduced from £ 30 to £24, why was the reduction made ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",18
"19","—1 cannot say, but it was done by the proprietor.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",19
"20","30368. What year was that ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",20
"21","—1881.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",21
"22","30369. Was it done after any statement made by the tenants?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",22
"23","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",23
"24","30370. You expressed a wish to have the rent reduced?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",24
"25","—Yes, to the factor.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",25
"26","30371. Did you state by how much you wished the rent to be reduced?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",26
"27","—No.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",27
"28","30372. You asked for a reduction of rent ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",28
"29","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",29
"30","30373. And you got to the extent of £ 6 out of £30?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",30
"31","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",31
"32","30374. Were you satisfied with that in 1881 ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",32
"33","—So far; it was a great help to us.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",33
"34","30375. Have things gone so much back since 1881 that you expect a still further reduction ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",34
"35","—Yes, the price of wool is decreasing.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",35
"36","30376. Do you and your neighbours consider yourselves as crofters or farmers, with this amount of land and the rent you pay ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",36
"37","—Crofters.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",37
"38","30377. But I suppose your crofts give as much work as occupies the whole of your time ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",38
"39","—Most of the year.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",39
"40","30378. Do you keep one or two horses each ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",40
"41","—-One each.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",41
"42","30379. When were the improvements made on which you pay the interest, which you now want to have done away with ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",42
"43","—It states in the paper.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",43
"44","30380. £10 each additional rent was laid on in name of interest for improvements,' but I do not think it mentions the date. This continued till 1859, when a new arrangement was made by giving the Old Glebe into Kirkton, and dividing the whole anew into six shares. The Old Glebe, while in the occupation of Sergeant Macrae, paid a rent of £30. But when added to Kirkton paid £40. In consideration of outlays by proprietors for building houses, byres, &c, the rent was at the same time increased to £ 20 each. Was all that done in 1859 ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",44
"45","— Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",45
"46","30381. There is no date given—did all that take place together ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",46
"47","—Of course it did ; we commenced paying it in 1859. ",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",47
"48","30382. Then the improvements were made in 1859?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",48
"49","—Yes. The improvements were not made, but after the arrangement was made we agreed to pay £20 each for building new houses and byres and barns, and we commenced paying it at once.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",49
"50",": 30383. Was any land improved at that time ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",50
"51","—Yes, they commenced shortly after that.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",51
"52","30384. Do you know what interest you paid on these improvements ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",52
"53","—It was 5 per cent, we promised.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",53
"54","30385. On what grounds do you wish that 5 per cent, now taken off? Are the improvements not as available now ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",54
"55","—Because we consider the amount is paid up, and the lots are too dear.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",55
"56","30386. But 5 per cent, cannot pay up the capital as well as the interest of money expended on improvements?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",56
"57","—Of course, when the money is paid by proprietors.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",57
"58","30387. If the money is paid up you think the charge made on the tenant should cease ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",58
"59","—Exactly.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",59
"60","30388. But have you ever heard it stated that when a proprietor borrows money from a company, or in old times from the Government, the charge made, which includes the paying up of capital as well as interest for twenty-five years, is £6, 14s. 6d. or something like that?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",60
"61","—No.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",61
"62","30389. Perhaps you thought that if a proprietor borrowed money to cover capital as well as interest the rate would be 5 per cent. ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",62
"63","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",63
"64","30390. You are not aware it was more ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",64
"65","—No.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",65
"66","30391. That 5 per cent, only represents the interest without paying the capital; and if you wish to pay the capital too it would require to be more—you are not aware of that ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",66
"67","—No.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",67
"68","30392. In point of fact, you and your neighbours wish for a reduction on two grounds—first, because you were under the impression that the whole of the money spent on improvements has been paid off by the tenants; and secondly, owing to the low price of wool ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",68
"69","—Yes; and more than that, we never got a reduction for the hill which was taken from us in 1852.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",69
"70","30393. But a new arrangement was made in 1859 was it not?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",70
"71","—That was made because the proprietor told us the rent, and the factor charged more than the proprietor said it would be in 1852.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",71
"72","30394. But in 1859, when the arrangement was made, did the tenants express themselves as satisfied, or did they remonstrate?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",72
"73","—It was all the same whether we would or not.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",73
"74","30395. But did you as a matter of fact say it was not a fair arrangement, and that you wanted something in respect of the hill pasture being taken ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",74
"75","—Of course I had to do it, or leave the place.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",75
"76","30396. You thought you had to do it?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",76
"77","—Yes, I was forced.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",77
"78","30397. In what way were you forced ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",78
"79","—He told me I would lose what I had, unless I would make that arrangement.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",79
"80","30398. What did the other tenants say ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",80
"81","—Some of them did not say anything with the exception of one, and he spoke to me, but at last he yielded.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",81
"82","30399. But in fact there was in 1859, when this arrangement was made, a feeling generally expressed amongst the tenants that it was an arrangement which was not fair towards them, and too favourable to the proprietors?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",82
"83","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",83
"84","30400. Did you speak to the factor about the place being still too dear in 1859?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",84
"85","—Of course we did, but he said we would get this work done, and we agreed upon the point. But we never thought it would come more than that until he commenced improving the land ; and he never",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",85
"86","asked what he should spend, but kept on aU along until we were charged at that rate. It was all the same whether we would complain or not.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",86
"87","30401. How is the present stock of sheep divided amongst you? Is it all common?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",87
"88","—Common, under one man.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",88
"89","30402. How much arable land have you got ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",89
"90","—About ten acres each, I should think.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",90
"91","30403. How many cattle have you each ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",91
"92","—Three, perhaps.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",92
"93","30404. Supposing that the proprietor was to reduce your rent on account of the low price of wool, would you be willing to pay an increased rent if the price of wool were to rise again ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",93
"94","—For all the wool we have it would not benefit us so much; even £ 1 or £2 a year would be something.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",94
"95","30405. £ 1 or £ 2 ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",95
"96","—£1 or £ 2 of reduction.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",96
"97","30406. You would be satisfied with a small reduction now ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",97
"98","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",98
"99","30407. You do not think your rent is very much too high since this reduction was made ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",99
"100","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",100
"101","30408. By how much ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",101
"102","—If it was the old rent.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",102
"103","30409. Without the money for the improvements ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",103
"104","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",104
"105","30410. Do you think you ought to have the improvements absolutely without paying for them ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",105
"106","—If it could be done.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",106
"107","30411. Do you think that, provided you got the improvements now for nothing, after a certain number of years, that would be an encouragement to any proprietor to improve his Land for other tenants, supposing they wanted it ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",107
"108","—I should think it would.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",108
"109","30412. You think it would be an encouragement to a proprietor to improve his land if after a number of years the tenants expected to have the improvements for nothing, and to get the reduction of £6 in their rent besides?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",109
"110","—I should think it would.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",110
"111","30413. You think the proprietor would like that, after expending money upon his property and getting no return ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",111
"112","—Has he not got a return when it is paid up and getting his land made better ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",112
"113","30414. Is there any use making the land better if there is to be no more rent got for it ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",113
"114","—If he makes the farms smaller and charges the same rent; and if a man on making improvements gets that part of the farm taken from him.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",114
"115","30415. How did you get at the stock which the various sheep farmers keep ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",115
"116","—I got it on good authority.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",116
"117","30416. You are satisfied in your own mind it is accurate ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",117
"118","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",118
"119","30417. Do you know all the sheep farmers personally?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",119
"120","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",120
"121","30418. Have you heard that they also complain of the low price of wool ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",121
"122","—I have not seen them of late.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",122
"123","30419. Have they got leases?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",123
"124","—I think they have.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",124
"125","30420. You have no leases ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",125
"126","—No.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",126
"127","30421. Would you like to have a lease ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",127
"128","—Yes, if we got the place at a fair rent which would pay us.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",128
"129","30422. Was a lease offered you in 1859?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",129
"130","—I do not know; I was not present.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",130
"131","30423. Did your neighbours ask a lease ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",131
"132","—I do not know.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",132
"133","30424. You do not know whether there was one asked ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",133
"134","—I was not present.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",134
"135","30425. In 1859, if a lease had been offered to you, would you and your neighbours have taken it on the terms on which you then engaged ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",135
"136","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",136
"137","30426. After the improvements were made?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",137
"138","—No. ",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",138
"139","30427. If you had accepted the offer of a lease and got a lease, you probably would not have had this £6 of a reduction ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",139
"140","—I cannot say. ",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",140
"141","30428. It never occurs to these large sheep farmers to ask reductions during their lease?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",141
"142","—They got more reduction than we got. ",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",142
"143","30429. At the same time?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",143
"144","—I don't know.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",144
"145","30430. Do you mean that the large sheep farmers got reduction during the currency of their lease ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",145
"146","—I cannot say what time they got it, but I know they got it.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",146
"147","30431. Are you sure you had no lease in 1859?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",147
"148","—I cannot say. I never knew of it. Perhaps there may have been some written agreement.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",148
"149","30432. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",149
"150","—Who was the factor in 1859 ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",150
"151","—Mr Finlayson.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",151
"152","30433. What became of him ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",152
"153","—He died.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",153
"154","30434. Was he a good factor?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",154
"155","—Middling.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",155
"156","30435. He did not do much good to the people in Lochalsh ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",156
"157","—No.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",157
"158","30430. Nor to the proprietor either?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",158
"159","—No.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",159
"160","30437. The loss of part of your pasture which was given to the inn was a very serious loss, was it not? ",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",160
"161","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",161
"162","30438. In fact, unless you get it back, the township will never get over it?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",162
"163","—I cannot go that length.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",163
"164","30439. How far will you go ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",164
"165","—It is a great loss to us.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",165
"166","30440. What is the name of the tenant of Balmacarra Inn ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",166
"167","—Robert Macleod.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",167
"168","30441. Where did he come from?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",168
"169","—Sutherlandshire originally.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",169
"170","30442. If your figures are correct in your statement about the rent and the stock kept by the other farmers you have mentioned, your township is paying more than you ought by a good deal ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",170
"171","—Yes, as far as I understand. I know the rent is right, because I had the valuation roll when writing that paper.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",171
"172","30443. And neither you nor your co-crofters understand why you should be charged more rent than the big men ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",172
"173","—Exactly.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",173
"174","30444. In fact, I suppose you would think it would be more reasonable to give the poor men the cheaper rent?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",174
"175","—I should think so.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",175
"176","30445. Whatever money you may earn or raise out of your croft, suppose you spend in the country ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",176
"177","—Yes, and more if we could get it.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",177

"406","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",406
"407","30560. If they had not put up these fences, could you have introduced the same improvements ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",407
"408","—I think so, but we would have had more trouble; we would have had to herd the cattle. ",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",408
"409","30561. Therefore you think it is a decided improvement to have made the enclosures ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",409
"410","—Yes. ",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",410
"411","30562. Do the enclosures divide each lot from the next?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",411

"428","—A little now and then.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",428
"429","30571. Do you think they might give themselves more trouble?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",429
"430","—Perhaps at times.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",430

"434","—I cannot say.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",434

"436","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",436
"437","30575. Is there much of it very high which would not be useful for sheep and cattle ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",437
"438","—I do not think it.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",438
"439","30576. Was the land occupied as a deer forest formerly, occupied as summer shielings ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",439

"448","—Yes, if the wind is too high in the ferry.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",448
"449","30581. Is there any inconvenience in the markets? Are you sometimes unable to send the cattle at the right moment ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",449
"450","—There is no inconvenience in that respect.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",450
"451","30582. You said that most of the large farms were let to south country people or strangers. Was that because strangers were preferred or the strangers have more capital than the natives ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",451
"452","—I rather think they were preferred.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",452
"453","30583. You think they loved the south country people better?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",453

"470","—-Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",470
"471","30591. That means that your arable ground will winter more cattle than you have summer pasture for?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",471
"472","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",472
"473","30592. Where do you get pasture for the cattle in Skye ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",473
"474","—On Lord Matheson Macdonald's estate.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",474
"475","30593. Is it on the small crofts or on the big farms ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",475
"476","— On the small crofts.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",476
"477","30594. Because they are too poor to keep cattle themselves ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",477

"483","30597. Is that what you are allowed to keep on ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",483
"484","—You can keep as many as you like, but that is the stock we have on.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",484
"485","30598. What stock is it estimated to carry ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",485
"486","—I do not know.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",486
"487","30599. When was the stock counted at 250 ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",487
"488","—At last clipping.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",488
"489","30600. Two hundred and fifty large animals?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",489
"490","—Yes, with the exception of four or five tups. I suppose if the hoggs could be sent to the low country, the pasture might carry 300.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",490
"491","30601. I suppose you can reduce the number of sheep and increase the number of cattle if you so please ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",491
"492","—I suppose we might if we so pleased.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",492

"494","—Not if we had not sheep at all.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",494
"495","30603. How many sheep would the hill pasture which was taken from you carry ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",495
"496","—Between sixty and seventy along with the other place. I cannot say that alone.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",496
"497","30604. And you think your rent is out of proportion to the rents round about ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",497
"498","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",498
"499","30605. Far too high ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",499
"500","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",500
"501","30606. If the rent was lower, that size of croft ought to be able to maintain a family?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",501
"502","—Yes, in some years, if it is a good season; but in such a year as last it would not.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",502
"503","30607. Last year was exceptional, but in ordinary years it would keep a family ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",503
"504","—Sometimes it would and sometimes not.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",504
"505","30608. You talk of having hired labour except for the house. Do you think that a man and a boy is not quite sufficient to work a croft of the size of yours ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",505
"506","—They would have enough to do to keep it in good order.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",506
"507","30609. It is more for the house than the farm that you require to get the servant ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",507
"508","—I require to get her for both.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",508

"511","30611. And a little in the spring?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",511
"512","—Not so much in spring.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",512
"513","30612. Who were employed on the improvement of the crofts ? It was not yourselves ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",513
"514","—No.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",514
"515","30613. Outside people ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",515
"516","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",516

"518","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",518
"519","30615. And that would have been the better way ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",519
"520","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",520
"521","30616. I suppose the reason for putting a fence round each park is that by that means you are enabled to leave out of crop the whole park at a time ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",521
"522","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",522
"523","30617. And is your own sixth share always the same bit of ground in the park ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",523
"524","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",524
"525","30618. How many parks are there?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",525
"526","—Nine.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",526
"527","30619. How do you work them?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",527
"528","—We work them in rotation. There is one of them that is in two parks ; it is double.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",528
"529","30620. How do you work them?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",529
"530","—In a five-shift rotation.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",530

"542","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",542
"543","30627. And in a good year the croft could support the family if the rent was reasonable ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",543
"544","—Some years.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",544
"545","30628. An ordinary average year?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",545
"546","—No, it never supported the family.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",546
"547","30629. Instead of £24, what would you consider a reasonable rent for the croft just now?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",547
"548","—£17 each.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",548
"549","30630. Would you be prepared to take the place upon lease at that rent ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",549
"550","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",550

"552","—No.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",552
"553","30632. You must have considered it very highly rented when it was £30 ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",553
"554","—Of course.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",554
"555","30633. The return I have here gives thirteen acres as the size of the crofts, but you say ten ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",555
"556","—That counts the patches. I know in some of the parks there is not six acres.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",556
"557","30634. And your own stock is just exactly the summing?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",557
"558","—Yes.",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",558
"559","30635. But there are some who have considerably more ?",514,"Donald Matheson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",559
