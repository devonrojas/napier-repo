"1","ALEXANDER M'LEAN, Crofter, Balmeanoch (73)—examined",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",1
"2","33573. The Chairman.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",2
"3","—You have a statement to submit to the Commission ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",3
"4","—I have. ' I, Alexander M'Lean (74), elder and crofter at Balameanoch, Tyree, humbly beg to bring before the Royal Commissioners the following facts and grievances, and crave their attention and consideration to the poor circumstances unto which I have been reduced through the ill-treatment I have received from time to time. About forty years ago I bought the first of my crofts for the'sum of £95 sterling, the yearly rental of which was at that time £6 sterling. I afterwards got possession of other two crofts, but for one of them I had to pay £5, and for the other £8, before I was allowed to take possession of them, these sums being equal to the yearly rental of the crofts. I held possession of the three crofts for a good number of years, and, although they were but small, having been together, I was able to live comfortably, and was perfectly satisfied. But a few years ago the last two mentioned crofts were taken from me, without either compensating me for improvements made, or even giving me back my own money which I paid for them, and this for the direct purpose of extending the ground of a stranger, who is not content by reducing me into my present poor circumstances, but who now uses all means to deprive me of my remaining one. The rent of my present croft is now £12, 11s . 6d., as compared with £6 thirty years ago, or upwards of £1 per acre of poor soil. I have",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",4
"5","now so little land, and what I have is so dear, that I would be utterly unable to fight against poverty, were it not for the support I get from my children in the Lowlands. My prayer is that I should get back my two crofts, and that the rent of the other one should be reduced to the old standard; and were this prayer answered I would be perfectly content and fairly comfortable.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",5
"6","33574. What do you mean by saying that forty years ago you bought the first of your crofts for the sum of £95 sterling ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",6
"7","—I bought it, as I stated, from the outgoing tenant. He went away to America at that time, and he had the right to sell the croft and everything that was upon it. There were two horses and one cow of stock, and there were the crops and houses; and when I valued the amount I paid him £95, and when I valued the amount of seed and labour that he expended upon the croft for that year and the houses, I considered I was over £40 out of pocket beyond the value of everything that I received.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",7
"8","33575. Did the sum of £95 include the cattle, horses, and growing crop ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",8
"9","—Yes, it included the stock, crops, and houses.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",9
"10","33576. How much were the houses valued at?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",10
"11","—There was no valuation.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",11
"12","33577. How much did you count out of the whole £95 was for the houses and offices ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",12
"13","—They were not much worth ; they were in a very backward condition, and I had to repair them and put them in order again, and I believe they were not worth as much as I expended in putting them in repair.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",13
"14","33578. The rest of the £95 was for stock?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",14
"15","—Yes.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",15
"16","33579. Why did you say you bought the croft for £95 sterling, when the money was for the purchase of stock on the croft ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",16
"17","—I bought it in order to have a dwelling there, and that I should cultivate it myself afterwards.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",17
"18","33580. You got two other crofts; who did you get them from ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",18
"19","—From the factor of the day.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",19
"20","33581. Who did they belong to before?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",20
"21","—It was other two men that had the crofts that I had before. One of them removed voluntarily to take up the croft his father possessed before, and the other one left, I don't know why or how.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",21
"22","33582. But you got them from two crofters?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",22
"23","—Yes, it was two crofters occupied that before.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",23
"24","33583. They were taken away from you and given to somebody else; who were they given to?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",24
"25","—They were given to the British Sea-weed Company.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",25
"26","33584. What use does the company make of the land ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",26
"27","—They cultivate it.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",27
"28","33585. Is it the company that cultivates it, or has the company given the two crofts to two tenants, or to one tenant ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",28
"29","—They keep it in their own hands.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",29
"30","33586. When the two crofts were taken away from you, you say you got no compensation for improvements. What improvements had you made?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",30
"31","—Well, I cultivated them; then they were drained; but they were drained at the factor's orders and his expense j but I paid interest all the time I was in possession of the crofts.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",31
"32","33587. Did you build any walls ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",32
"33","—There were fences, and I kept them in repair.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",33
"34","33588. You say there is a stranger who is not content with reducing you to your present poor circumstances, but wishes to deprive you of your present croft. Who is this stranger?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",34
"35","—The manager of this seaweed company. He wanted to get the only one I have.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",35
"36","33589. How do you know that?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",36
"37","—The factor told me.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",37
"38","33590. When the manager asked the factor for the croft, what did the factor say ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",38
"39","—I cannot tell that; I did not ask that.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",39
"40","33591 Do you think you are in any danger of losing your last croft?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",40
"41","—I cannot say very well. Of course, I did not know that I was in danger of losing those that I lost. But what I particularly wish now is to get them back again.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",41
"42","33592. But the people from whom you got them might come and ask to get them back again ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",42
"43","—Well, they have another place.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",43
"44","33593. So have you?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",44
"45","—Oh, yes; but it is very small I consider it far too small. If it was large enough, I would not ask these crofts back.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",45
"46","33594. Lots four, five, six, seven, and eight are in the possession of the stranger. Do you mean the company?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",46
"47","—Yes.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",47
"48","33595. What use does the company make of those five lots ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",48
"49","—They cultivate them.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",49
"50","33596. Are these five lots necessary for the trade of the company —for their business?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",50
"51","—They must have considered that themselves anyhow before they asked them or got them.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",51
"52","33597. What do you think?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",52
"53","—My opinion is that they might have done without them. Their allegation is that they required them in order",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",53
"54","to feed the horses necessary for their work ; but they had two crofts before these, and they might have fed their horses upon these.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",54
"55","33598. Does the company do good to the people ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",55
"56","—I believe in a sense they do some good, to some of the people at least. They employ some of the people; they keep a store, where they provide goods for the people.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",56
"57","33599. Do they give good wages ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",57
"58","—The wages do not seem large, and the people complain of it.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",58
"59","33600. Do they ever give money, or do they always pay in goods ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",59
"60","—With goods.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",60
"61","33601. What is the reason the company do not pay in money ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",61
"62","—It is likely that they make profit off the goods, and that they prefer to give goods rather than money.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",62
"63","33602. Do the people complain that the goods are bad or dear ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",63
"64","—They complain that they are dear.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",64
"65","33603. But is the quality of the goods good ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",65
"66","—I believe they may be about as good as are going; but when they pay in money they only pay half. For a ton of kelp they only give £2 in ready money, but they give £4 worth of goods.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",66
"67","33604. If a man refused to accept the goods in payment, would he get any employment from the company, or would the company turn him off ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",67
"68","—-I really cannot tell.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",68
"69","33605. This paper is all about your own case. What have you to say about the other crofters in Balmeanoch ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",69
"70","—There is only one other tenant and myself and this company in the whole township. He has his two crofts still; he was not deprived of any of them; but I believe he complains of the high rent.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",70
"71","33606. Have you been deprived of any hill pasture ?",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",71
"72","—No; the township has the old hill pasture.",562,"Alexander Mclean","Argyll, Tyree",72
