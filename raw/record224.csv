"1","ANGUS MACAULAY, Middle Quarter (30)—examined.",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",1
"2","12490. The Chairman.—Are you a crofter?",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",2
"3","—I am a crofter's son. I have a written statement here :",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",3
"4","—' Unto the Royal Commission (Highlands and Islands). The following statement is humbly submitted by Angus Macaulay, crofter's son, on behalf of the crofters of Middle Quarter. I am thirty years of age, and was born in the neighbouring township of Sollas where my father and grandfather were, crofters. I live now in Middle Quarter, where my father has been crofter for fourteen years. Prior to 1815, there had been only six crofters in Middle Quarter, paying a rental of £ 3 each. Now there are nine crofters, paying a rental of £6, 10s, or nearly £8 including burdens, and six crofters having only half lots, paying a rental of £3, 5s., or nearly £4 including burdens; and six cottars. Those having a full croft keep three or four cows and two horses, and those having half lots keep one or two cows and a horse; but the place is considerably overstocked so that cows as a rule have calves only every alternate year; yet our stirks and stots, which are all that we sell of the produce of the land for payment of rent and to meet other requirements, are generally the worst in the island. The ground is again so exhausted by continual cultivation that it will yield little or nothing more than sufficient provender for the cattle and horses, nor will it yield even that without being well manured every year; and the holdings are so small that we can't leave more than from 1/8 to 1/10 of the arable land in fallow annually, and the best part of the land is never in fallow, but under cultivation every year, otherwise we can't have sufficient provender for our cattle and horses. We begin to manure the ground in the beginning of November, and  continue till the beginning of June. We have to cart the sea-ware a distance of three or four miles of a soft sandy beach, where we require a pair of horses in each cart. We also bring part of the sea-ware five or six miles in boats, which we have to keep for the purpose, and which we can only use for a short period in spring, when the day is long and the weather good, and which are of little or no use to us for fishing purposes. If we had more land, so that we could leave about a third of it in fallow every year, we would not require so  much manure, and the land would be more productive. Potatoes have been a failure for a number of years on our crofts, and we are obliged to buy ground from the neighbouring farmers, in a white sandy ground, in which it has been found that potatoes resist the disease better than in the barren and shallow grounds we have on our crofts. We pay five days' labour for every four hundred square yards which we buy thus; and besides we have to level and improve that ground, which costs us a further labour of from six to ten days for the same area. The following spring we have to manure the same ground over again, then plough, sow, and harrow it, reap and bind it in autumn, and then give half of the corn to the farmer. Yet we are glad to get ground even on these conditions, otherwise we would have little or no potatoes, which, with south country meal, is our main support. The crofters of Middle Quarter have since last Martinmas on an average bought twelve bolls of south country meal; some bought as much as twenty bolls, and they will require half as much again before the latter end of August. They all complain of their poverty, and to their being indebted to south country merchants, and say that the cause is the small size of their holdings. If they had double or triple the area of arable land, they feel sure it would support them, for they could manage it without any increase of expense in keeping horses, carts, and boats, if they had a few more cattle and sheep. On account of the distance we have to cart the sea-ware to the crofts, two horses are absolutely indispensable, and they consume fully half of the corn crop. The cause of the crofters being examined here and elsewhere in North Uist were the repeated evictions from the neighbouring townships, which were carried on while Lord Macdonald was proprietor. These evictions commenced more than sixty years ago, while Mr Cameron was factor, and were carried on by Mr Shaw afterwards; and finally, while Mr Macdonald, Balranald, was factor, the people of Sollas, Dunskellar, Middle Quarter, and Malaglet were ruthlessly evicted. When the sheriff officers met with more or less resistance in serving notices of removal, a large body of constabulary were brought from Inverness, and in a pamphlet written two years ago by Mr Patrick Cooper, advocate, Aberdeen, who was then baron-bailie of the estate, and was present to see the eviction of the people effected, we read that Lord Macdonald telegraphed to Earl Grey for a regiment of soldiers—not to protect the sheriff officers in serving notices of removal, as this had already been effected, but to protect along with the constabulary the ground officers and other minions of the factor's while pulling down the houses over the people's heads, and that his Lordship's request was granted, and that a regiment was in readiness in Fort George, but fortunately, as the men offered no resistance, their services were dispensed with. With the exception of a slight skirmish between the women and the constabulary, the officers were not molested while carrying on their cruel and destructive work. However, four men were brought to Inverness, and sentenced to four months imprisonment. Some of them never recovered from the ill-usage they got from the police, and the subsequent starvation they got in the prison of Inverness, where they were glad to chew and swallow the juice of the oakum to assuage the cravings of hunger. One of them died shortly after his return, leaving a widow with posthumous child, and four young",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",4
"5","1 orphans. As there are other delegates who were eye-witnesses of those evictions, I will not trouble your Lordship with further details, but state briefly the demands of the crofters, viz.—",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",5
"6","(1) More land at a fair rent to be fixed by a land court; ",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",6
"7","(2) fixity of tenure, and compensation for improvements. ",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",7
"8","There are only two ways by which the present condition of the crofters can be ameliorated, first, emigration, which is most repugnant to the feelings of the people, and of which they had a bitter experience. It is only thirty years since an emigrant ship was brought to Lochmaddy, on board of which twelve or fourteen families from the district in which I reside were prevailed upon or forced to embark for Australia. Emigrants who had been previously on board the vessel were discovered to be infected with two deadly epidemics, viz., smallpox and fever. The passage was a most disastrous one to the wretched emigrants, most of whom became victims of the epidemics; some of them died, and were thrown overboard; others were landed in Ireland, where a number of them are buried. The survivors were sent over in different batches as they recovered; families were broken up, some of them never to meet again; and their sufferings on landing in Australia were not much better as they had to sell their blankets and part of their clothing before they got to the settlement. What we have against emigration also are the different difficulties with which we would have to contend, such as the extremes of climate, our ignorance of the mode of farming in foreign countries, and our inability through poverty to get stock and farming implements on our arrival there, &c. The second and by far the more congenial way to ameliorate the condition of the Highland crofters is to give them sufficient of that land which gave them birth, and while there is plenty of land in our native country under sheep and deer, we see no reason why we should emigrate, and we are determined to resist a forced emigration to the bitter end. The forgoing statement is certified to be from the undersigned crofters of Middle Quarter.' Signed by fifteen",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",8

How many families are there in the township ?",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",14
"15","—There are fifteen crofters' families and six cottars—twenty-one families.",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",15
"16","12494. Has the number of crofters increased of late years? How many were there twenty or thirty years ago? —I am not aware they have increased. I think they are just about the same, only there were sixteen crofters about ten years ago.",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",16

"30","—Well, we would be the better of having fences between us and the neighbouring tacksman, for we are complaining of the tacksman's cattle, and he complains of us.",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",30
"31","12502. Have you any difficulty about getting thatch for the houses?",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",31

"37","12505. Have you any complaint about sea-ware? How far have you to bring the sea-weed for manure? —We have to bring it a distance of from two to four miles in carts, but we don't get it near the crofts even when we take it with boats.

"73","12524. Of course you don't know that of your own knowledge ?",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",73
"74","—I am sure it was paid, and I think it was to the factor it was paid.",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",74
"75","12525. Are you aware whether it is common in the country to pay arrears of rent in that way ?",224,"Angus Macaulay","North Uist, Loch Eport",75
