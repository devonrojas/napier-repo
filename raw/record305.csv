"3","—You have a statement to make to the Commission ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",3
"4","—Yes. I do not mean to reply to all that has been said either in the way of commenting on it or contradicting it. A great deal has been said that I know is not strictly accurate; and there have been statements made that I cannot say whether they are correct or not. As I did in other parishes, I shall begin by giving a few statistics regarding the parish of Stornoway, and afterwards make a few general remarks on matters connected with the management of the estate since it was acquired by the late Sir James Matheson. Of the total area of the parish of Stornoway, not including the burgh of Stornoway and the town lands, there are 41,747 acres, let to the crofters at a rent of £2,491, Is. 6d., or at the rate of Is. 1¼d. per acre, and there is an area under nine arable and grazing farms—not including the home or manor farm—of 16,851 acres, the rent of which is £1102, 10s. 6d., equal to Is. 3½d. per acre. The stock held by the crofters in 1882 was 2805 head of cattle, 5880 head of sheep, 201 horses, and 32 pigs. The nine tacksmen have 202 head of cattle, 2007 head of sheep, 29 horses, and 4 pigs. I may also give the stock of 1881, as there was a larger number of cattle and sheep sold in 1882 than there had been for some years. The crofters then had 3074 head of cattle, 5732 sheep, 213 horses, and 27 pigs, and the tacksmen had 192 head of cattle, 2047 sheep, 28 horses, and 7 pigs. In both cases the respective rents were those already stated. The Commissioners have asked me to furnish them with a statement of the rental now and in 1844. When Sir James Matheson bought the estate, the rental in 1844, exclusive of feuduties, but including salmon fishings and £200 for shootings, was £10,681, 2s. 5d. This includes the statute labour and 'kain' money, that was contributed by 2059 crofters—the number then in the island. The present rental, according to the valuation roll of 1882-83, is as follows :",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",4

"16","or an increase since 1844 of £7482. The land rental of that year was £10,256, in 1882 it was £12,713, being an increase on the land rental of £2457. I am at present unable to say how much of this increase is on crofters and how much on tacksmen, not having had time to make it up. But I find that in 1852, £365,  18s. 11d. was charged against tacksmen a interest on improvements, and £202, 5s. 3d. on crofters. Some of the large farms as they were improved were for some  time thereafter held by the proprietor, till he brought them into a proper state of cultivation, and thereafter let, so I am unable to show the total amount  of interest charges for improvements. The increase in the land rental is, however, principally on tacksmen and on waste lands reclaimed, on which crofters  were placed. Seventeen townships were partly reclaimed from waste land in different parts of the island, and on these about £1500 were expended.  Besides  these new townships, waste land was reclaimed and added to old townships. It has been said that the land for these new townships was reclaimed from the  crofters' pasture lands, and that the townships from which such land was taken received no reduction of rent. I have to explain, that after the land was  reclaimed, the townships in the island were adjusted and allotted and rented anew at what they were considered worth. The rents in some cases were raised and  in other cases reduced, and many of them were left at the rent they stood at in 1844. This readjustment and revaluation was done in 1849, 1850, and 1851,  when Mr John Munro Mackenzie was factor, and in the work, he had the assistance of a practical farmer and a land surveyor. The whole island was relotted and  rented at that time; and with this exception—that the statute labour and 'kain' money was included in the rent, instead of continuing to be levied as a  separate payment. There has been no rise of rent since that period. There were in all 890 acres of land reclaimed. Part of this was added to existing  holdings, which were entirely remodelled, and the remainder given to cottars or squatters in the townships to which the new land was attached. There was  expended in the reclamation of waste lands and in building farm houses and offices £99,720. Of this sum there was expended on the reclamation of land given  to crofters the following sums:—At Barvas, £1320; Shader, £944; Lionel, £372; Port of Ness, £ 24 ; Cross, £ 13 ; Eorodale, £17, 10s ; Breasclete, £202; Doune  Carloway, £273; Carloway, £260; South Shawbost, £52 ; F. P. Borve, £ 181; Mid Borve, £71 ; North Dell, £422; Newmarket, £676 ; Guershader, £ 85 ; Laxdale,  £46 ; Jamesfield, £444, let now to the Sandwick tenants for £ 7 ; Steinish, £194 ; Knock, £214; North Galston, £615 ; Bayble, £576 ; SheshaderAird,  £104; Port Voller, £39; Bragor, £ 71 ; Arnol, £ 62; Brue, £ 81 ; Swainbost, £251 ; Habost (Ness), £137 ; Skegirster, £107 ; Portnaguirin, £100; Shinlishader,  £269 ; Islinich, £95 ; Brenish £138 = £8471, 10s. It has been stated here that the late Sir James Matheson never did anything for the island. Immediately  after purchasing this property Sir James' attention was directed to opening steam communication with Glasgow. He offered a premium of £500 to any shipowner  in Glasgow that would put on a steamer, but no one accepted the offer. He then took shares in a steamer named the 'Falcon,' which then commenced to run  between Stornoway and Ardrossan. Her career, however, was short, and she took fire and had to be scuttled. I may mention an incident which occurred at this  time in connection with the burning of this vessel. The merchants by that time had begun to depend on getting their goods regularly by steamer, but when it  so suddenly ceased to run, before they could order their supplies and get them brought by a sailing vessel, the town of Stornoway had run out of almost  everything. There was not one pound of tea or sugar or tobacco or snuff in the place. After the 'Falcon,' Sir James purchased the steamer 'Mary Jane,' and it  was put on in 1845 to run between this town and Glasgow. This boat however, became too small, and in conjunction with the Duke of Sutherland he got another  vessel, called the 'Marquis of Stafford,' which was stipulated to call at Lochinver on its way from Stornoway to Glasgow. Sir James subsequently gave up his  connection with the'Marquis of Stafford,' and the steamer ' Islay' was put on by Mr Ramsay of Vuldalton. Thereafter Messrs Daniel Hutcheson and Co. took up the trade which is carried on now so efficiently by Mr MacBrayne. Before Sir James' time the island had been without any means of communication with the  mainland, except a sailing mail packet to Poolewe once or twice a week, with a steamer plying regularly once a week to Glasgow. The inhabitants found in the  south a ready market for their produce, and the prices of everything rose, particularly eggs. After the 'Mary Jane' was put on I have heard the merchants say  that it was of such advantage to them that they could turn over their capital three times before their bills became due ; whereas formerly, when they  depended on sailing vessels, their bills often became due before their goods arrived. The next thing I would like to refer to is what the late Sir James  Matheson did for education in the island. First of all, there was the 'Female Industrial Seminary' in Stornoway, which was built and has since been kept up  at the sole expense of Sir James and Lady Matheson. Besides this, there were new schools built at Knock, Borve, Lionel, and Bernera, and there were teachers  paid at Back, Shawbost, Callanish, Valtos, Balallan, Steinish, and in other places, the names of which I cannot recollect at present. Free education was given in these schools, but the attendance was so wretched that ultimately Sir James handed the schools over to the 'Edinburgh Ladies' Association,' but he  continued to give a subscription for each school to the society, and Lady Matheson still does so. The total amount expended on schools and teachers' salaries  up to 1870 was £11,680. In 1844 there were about 45 miles of imperfectly formed roads in the island; there are now 200 miles, which with bridges cost  £25,593. Even in 1845, of wheeled vehicles there was only one gig in the whole island, now there are 87 taxed conveyances. Among many other things Sir James  did for the benefit of the people, I may mention that he was the means of introducing water and gas to the town of Stornoway. He expended in making the  patent slip, £ 6000; curing houses, £ 1000; on bulls for the improvement of the crofters'stock, £1200; a quay for the steamer at Stornoway, £2225 ; chemical  works, £33,000, and though that was not a profitable speculation for the proprietor, it afforded employment for a good many people. The Rev. Mr Angus Maciver  stated that he did not know of anything that Sir James and Lady Matheson had done for the parish of Uig, except to give a £ 10 subscription to the building  of a church at Bernera, and some clothes, shoes, and meal to the poor. I think the making of roads and bridges in Uig was of some benefit to the parish.  There were also schools upheld by Sir James at Valtos, at Bernera, and at Callanish, and besides the grants he gave to the 'Edinburgh Ladies' Association'for  other schools in the parish. There has been a large sum of money expended on Morsgeil forest; and from £500 to £ 800 are annually expended in upholding the place, which gives employment to people in Uig. The building of the lodge at Uig also gave employment to not a few people, it having been constructed of  concrete, for which skilled labour was not required. I may also mention that Mr Maciver himself was one of the teachers paid by Sir James for many years at  Shawbost; and it is perhaps not going too far to say that thereby Mr Maciver was enabled, in some measure at least, to prosecute his studies for the ministry  and attain to the position which he now holds. I venture to say that a gentleman in Mr Maciver's position, before making the remarks he did on this subject,  might have taken some pains to acquaint himself with the exact facts of the case. It was stated by many of the delegates who appeared before the  Commissioners that the crofters of the Lewis were in a much more comfortable condition and better off many years ago than they are now. I find, however, in  Sir John Sinclair's Statistical Account, published in 1797, that the minister of Stornoway of that day says —' Some of the land about the town is let for 36s. per acre yearly. There are about twelve large farms in the parish, and what portion of them is not  occupied by the tacksman himself is let to sub-tenants, who pay to him each person from £1, 10s. to £ 3 of yearly rent, and twelve days' service. Many of  these sub-tenants are employed in fishing ling, which they sell to their masters at 5d. each, engaging on board the herring-busses at £1 per month; in  manufacturing kelp at £1, 10s. per ton, and working at road making and other labour at 8d. a any. By these means and the produce of the soil they are enabled  to pay their rents, and procure a tolerable subsistence.' He also says: —' In no season is the produce of the parish sufficient to maintain its inhabitants, who would often be in danger of suffering through want, were it not for  the extensive importation of meal to Stornoway.' Again he says:—The inhabitants of this island might live in comfortable circumstances, were it not for the  frequent and heavy rains which fall in it at all seasons of the year, and more especially in harvest, whereby the hopes of husbandmen are often blasted, and  the fruit of his toil and industry lost.' As to wages, he says —'The wages of men-labourers are 8d. a day without meat, and 6d. with two meals of meat and a dram; women 6d. a day, 1 or 4d. with two meals of meat;  manservants for farm-work from £2 to £5 per annum, and two pairs of shoes at 7s. For women-servants from 10s. to 20s. and two pairs of shoes at 6s. Herds for  looking after cattle from 6 merks to 8s., with two pairs of shoes and other small perquisites.' The prices of cattle were from 30s. to £ 3 per head. Beef was  sold in Stornoway at 1½d. to 3d. per pound, mutton at 5s. and 6s. per wedder; sheep 3s., 4s., and 4s, 6d. each; lambs Is. 8d. and 2s. each. Butter, 12s. and  14s. per stone; cheese, 4s. and 5s. per stone; fowls, 4d. to 6d. each. In a supplement to this account of Stornoway, written by another hand, it is said: —'The parish never supplies itself with sufficiency of provisions, and always imports a great deal from Caithness, Berwick, &c, and is at this time (1796) in great distress, without the probability of a speedy supply.' Again he says: —'The people are not fond of a military life, but early habit reconciles them to seafaring, and from that element they derive their chief subsistence. The  common people in this island marry very early, and when death separates them, if the surviving party—whether male or female—finds it convenient to engage a  second or third time in this state, some of them remain a few weeks, and some only a few days in widowhood. So that grief for the loss of husband or wife is  an affliction little known among the lower classes of the people here. A woman in this country, whose husband accidentally shot himself, settled her contract  of marriage in the way she thought fit before the body of her late husband was interred, and she married next day after she had performed the last duty to  the deceased.' In the same book, statistics are given by which the stock of the island of that day may be compared with what it is now. In Barvas in 1796, in  the whole of the parish, it was calculated there were 1050horses, 2670 black cattle, and 3392 sheep ; while now the crofters' stock numbered 549 horses, 3591  head of cattle, and 14,238 sheep. The horses then sold on an average for £2, 10s.; cows and stots at £2 5s.; and sheep at 3s. In the parish of Lochs the  stock was 2488 black cattle, 4000 sheep, and 348 horses. There were now held by the crofters alone 50 horses, 3392 head of cattle, and 11,132 head of sheep.  The whole stock in Uig was 3562 cattle, 5044 sheep, and 682 horses. To-day the crofters have 2386 cattle, 8097 sheep, and 20 horses. The minister of this  parish also states that the parish never supplied itself with a sufficiency of provisions. From these extracts, it can hardly be said that the Lewis was in  such a prosperous state long ago as many delegates have represented. Even at that time, with a small population, the crofters appear to have been in poor  circumstances, and not unfrequently in a state of destitution. I have already mentioned that the island was lotted and rented in 1849, 1850, and 1851, and I  believe that if each crofter had held by his croft as he then got it, and not have subdivided it with his sons, they would have been, comparatively speaking,  comfortably off, to what they are now. Everything possible was done to prevent this subdivision of crofts. Many were served with summonses of removal for  allowing their sons and daughters to squat on their croft, though these were not enforced. In some cases the son was obliged to pull down the house he had  built, and go and live with his father again. Notwithstanding, in the course of a year or two, he would commence to build a second house; but the difficulty was, if we had obliged him to pull down the house again, what were we to do with him, for we could not drive him out of the Lewis. In my opinion, were there  free emigration, this subdivision of crofts might be prevented, but not otherwise. Frequent complaints have been made about new crofters being placed in  townships; what frequently occurred was this— a number of young married men would apply to the factor, and sometimes to the proprietor, to give them waste  land outside the township— and waste such land too often was, in every sense of the word, as the surface was removed to form bedding to their cows. The  crofters in the township would support this application, urging, possibly, that the applicants were their relatives, and that they would earn their living by fishing if they had even the site of a house. Now the original crofters make it a grievance that the application was granted. This policy was, in my  judgment, a mistake. Very frequently, while driving along a road, strangers think that the land outside the villages could be cultivated, forgetting all the  while that such as it was, it was the pasture of the original crofters ; and that to place additional crofters on it, was to put on additional stock upon the  ground. The crofters themselves, in reply to such an argument as that, would say that their sons and their daughters were already on them, were married, and  had families and stock, and that by putting them on waste lands outside the township they would not increase the stock more than there was on the ground. There was one such case in the parish of Ness, where some twenty young men applied for land in this way. It was represented that they were fishermen, and  only required a site for a house and land to keep a cow each. They were fishermen, but to-day they are amongst the poorest in Ness. Delegates from the  township of Lionel complained of new crofters being placed in Adabrock, but they took no objection at the time, and supported the application in every way. I  stated in the parish of Uig, that I never heard of any complaint from any one in the parish of being highly rented. But I had a complaint from the township  of Balallan, in the parish of Lochs, and I referred the matter to two practical men—one chosen by the people and the other by myself. They accordingly valued the place. At the same time, I added to the township a considerable stretch of moorland pasture formerly attached to the farm of Valtos, the farmer having  given it up, as it was surrounded by crofters, and he could make no use of it ; and the result of the valuation, with the Valtos moor added, was a rise of  rent of £11. There was also a deduction of rent given to the township of Limervag, in the same parish. I may say that I am at all times quite prepared to  refer the rental of any township to the judgment of any two practical men. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",16
"17","Angus Macarthur, the delegate from Kirkibost, Bernera, stated that Kirkibost was a very dear place, and that he understood that they were paying £30 more  than the tacksman. Now that is not the case. In 1827 Kirkibost was let for £138, and it has not been let for less until it was given for £120 to the  crofters, who had, in addition, a right the tacksman of Kirkibost never had, namely, of grazing a certain number of stock on the mainland. One might also  infer from that delegate's statement that they were forced to go to Kirkibost, but that is not the case. They applied for it, and did not consider it dear at  the time. I have in other instances, where it could be done, added to the pasture of the crofters. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",17
"18","When the farm of Aignish was out of lease, a portion of it was added to the township of Garrabost, another portion was given to Melbost and Branahine, and I  also give to Melbost a pasture park formerly held by John Macrae, a mason. I likewise added to the township of Holm pasture land, when the farm of Holm was  out of lease. I added another portion of the same farm to Sandwickhill, and likewise a piece of Mossend farm and Jamesfield. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",18
"19","George Macaulay, the delegate from Hacklete, stated that the township would not support more than half of the people now in it. Some of the crofters in  Hacklete were once in Croir, and were removed from the latter place at their own request. There were something like ten crofters in Croir and as many  cottars. Well, when these were removed to Hacklete, they considered that it was too big for them, and that it would accommodate more tenants, and accordingly  four or six families were taken from the township of Tobson and placed with them. Had the people of Hacklete not expressed a desire to have those crofters in  the township, the other four or six would not have been brought in. They only paid the rent charged when the former tacksman had it. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",19
"20","Neil Maclennan, delegate from Breasclete Park, stated that they were formerly in Reef, that they had no arrears, and that there was no reason for their  removal; now, the reason for the removal of the people of Reef was that the people were deeply in arrears, and that the soil was light and sandy, unfit for  cultivation, but suitable for permanent pasture. For the same reason, viz., arrears of rent, the township of Carnish was also cleared. In fact, it may be  said that all the townships cleared were so treated because of so many of the people being in arrears of rent, and because the land was unsuitable for  crofters. It cannot be said with truth that any were forced to emigrate, for when it was arranged that a township was to be cleared, only those who were  willing to go abroad were sent, the others were provided with crofts vacated in other parts of the island by parties emigrating. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",20
"21","North Galston crofters applied for aid to emigrate, and a ship was engaged to take off a number of people in the township; but when it came to about the time  for them to leave, many declined to go, and in order to fill up the ship which had been chartered, people were taken from other townships in the island.  Those who did not emigrate from Galston had vacant crofts given them in other townships. It was likewise stated that some of those who emigrated were not  well off. Now, I know that there were several letters sent from them, to Sir James Matheson, thanking him for having sent them to America, and stating how  comfortable they were. I believe that those letters are now in my office, though I could not lay my hands on them, but if I get them I will send them to the  Commissioners. There were four tenants removed from Reef to Breasclete Park. There are now ten families there. Neil Maclennan, the delegate, was a son of one  of those crofters, and the croft of his deceased father is now shared by three sons and their mother. This delegate is a shoemaker, and at first he applied  for a site for a house in which to carry on his trade. When he got this, he and the other members of the family divided the croft among them. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",21
"22","Murdoch Macdonald, the delegate from Tobson, said that a dyke was built between them and Bosta, where their burying place is, but that there is no gate on  the road, and that they had to carry the dead over the wall. I have to say that the burying ground is not in Bosta, but in Little Bernera, and that there is  a public road across the island to Croir, where they take a ferry to Littie Bernera. The public road is quite close to them, and there is no occasion for  them crossing the dyke at all. But they think they should always go that way, because the fishermen in rough weather, when they land at Bosta, come over the  wall for a short cut. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",22
"23","Then as to the burying ground at Eye. The delegate from Steinish stated that the road to the burying ground at Aignish was closed up. Now, there never was a  public road through the farm of Melbost to Aignish. That is just another 'short cut' to take instead of going round by the ordinary road.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",23
"24","Malcolm MacPhail, South Shawbost, stated that there were twice as many in that township paying rent to-day as there were when he first began to do so, and  that people had been crowded in upon them from Dallbeg. Well, in 1819, Dallbeg was let on lease for £52, and South Shawbost was relotted and rented to  thirty-seven tenants at the same time, at what it was considered worth. The boundaries and marches are still the same. In 1881 there were thirty-seven  tenants and eighteen squatters in the township. As to the cow taken from him by the ground officer as overstock, for which he only got £2, though it was  worth £ 6 , I cannot, without the date, trace if there is such an entry in the books, but I am inclined to doubt the statement that at that time a crofter's  cow would fetch £6. The crowding in this township arises from the subdivision of crofts by the crofters themselves, against the regulations of the estate. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",24
"25","John Nicolson's statement about the woman and her house being pulled down is not correct in all its particulars. She, and her mother-in-law, it appears,  could not agree, and her husband and she went to live in the barn. Her husband was warned not to occupy the barn as a dwelling house, but to live with his mother, but notwithstanding that the use of the barn was not discontinued. When the ground officer went to the place the woman was with her mother-in-law.  The barn had the appearance of having been occupied. There was a fire in it, and there was communication between the main house and the barn. An outdoor had  evidently been nearly closed up with turf, on learning that the ground officer was to be there. The fire was extinguished, and the parties told that they  must not occupy the barn, but the barn was not pulled down, and the man and his wife are there to-day. Many say that this system of squatting should and  could be prevented, but when an attempt is made to enforce the rules of the estate a ' hue and cry' is immediately raised about the cruelty and oppression of  evictions. It should be mentioned that the woman referred to was the delegate's own daughter.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",25
"26","A delegate from one of the Shawbosts stated that a man in his township had to pay £ 5 for the arrears of the outgoing tenant. A man, Malcolm Maclean, was  £25, 16s. 7d. in arrears, and was warned to remove. Kenneth MacPhail came forward and offered to pay £ 5 for the house and crop then on the ground if he got  the lot. He accordingly did so on payment of £5, and the balance of arrears (£20, 16s. 7d.) was wiped off as irrecoverable. MacPhail thereafter built a house  for himself and left MacLean to occupy the old house. In like manner Colin Macaulay in 1871 got Widow Catherine MacLean's oroft, and for the house and crop  laid down in the spring of 1871 he paid £3.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",26
"27","Another case referred to was that of Donald Macdonald, Fevig (Bragar). This man and his step-mother, Widow Christina Macaulay, were joint-tenants on a croft  rented at £3, and when his stepmother died there were £11, 8s. 2d. of arrears, for which as joint-tenants he was as much responsible as the widow. Macdonald  became sole occupier of the lot, but it was arranged that instead of pressing for immediate payment, the man should pay it up by instalments of £1 annually.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",27
"28","In supplement of what I have said as to what Sir James did for the island, there are just one or two things more which I should like to mention. I forgot to  mention, when speaking of the 'Mary Jane' and the 'Marquis of Stafford' steamers, that Sir James' loss by these was £15,000. Sir James was also the means of  getting postal communication by steamer from Ullapool five times instead of twice a week. His loss by that contract was £16,800. He also endowed 'The  Nicolson Educational Institution' with a sum sufficient to produce an annual income of £35, besides giving them a free site. I might also mention Lady  Matheson's contribution of £1500 to the Ness harbour and £1500 to the destitution fund.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",28
"29","I do not think it is worth while to take up the time of the Commission in seriously considering the statements made by Mr Morison, the Land League delegate  here on Saturday.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",29
"30","16834. Have you anything further to add to that paper? —I may state that the total area of island, exclusive of foreshore and water, is 404,476 acres; deduct for forests, 34,747; deduct again for farms, arable   and grazing, 124,763; glebes, 2573; parks, including home farm and round about and town here, 1559; leaves 240,834 acres in the possession of crofters. The   rental of that is £8463, being at the rate of 8¼d. per acre. I have only to add further, that the public burdens in 1880—poor rates, school rates, sanitary   and public health, county assessments, property and income tax, stipends, and so on—amounted to £5051; 1881, £437, 1882, £4623.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",30
"31","16835. Professor Mackinnon. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",31
"32","—What were they in 1844 ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",32
"33","—Under £700.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",33
"34","16836. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",34
"35","—You have told us that the rent per acre of land under crofters is 8¼d., but you have not told us what is the rate per acre on the remaining 163,000? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",35
"36","—I have not got that noted.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",36
"37","16837. Which is the most valuable land—the land represented by the 240,000 acres or the land represented by the 163,000 ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",37
"38","—Well, there is some good and some bad in both, but the larger proportion of what is under the grazing farms is not of great value.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",38
"39","16838. Is or is not the cream of the island outside the crofters' possessions? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",39
"40","—Not on what I call sheep farms, apart from the arable farms about the town of Stornoway.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",40
"41","16839. How long have you been chamberlain? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",41
"42","—Eight years.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",42
"43","16840. How long have you been a resident in the island? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",43
"44","—Thirty-eight years.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",44
"45","16841. Have you been all that time connected with the estate ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",45
"46","—With the exception of two or three years, I mean that I was not in the chamberlain's office for two or three years.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",46
"47","16842. But for thirty-five years you have been either in the chamberlain's office or chamberlain ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",47
"48","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",48
"49","16843. You were there during the whole time of the late chamberlain, your predecessor, Mr Munro ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",49
"50","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",50
"51","16844. You have given us some extracts from the Statistical Account of 1796. Are you aware that there is a later edition ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",51
"52","—Yes, I am aware of that.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",52
"53","16845. Did you compare the statements in the later edition with those in the former ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",53
"54","—I had not time to do so.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",54
"55","16846. Are you aware that they vary very much, I refer to the general statement for 1833 to 1842 ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",55
"56","—I did not read that one.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",56
"57","16847. You told us that the number of acres reclaimed and given to crofters amounted altogether over the island to 890 acres ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",57
"58","—Not the whole of it.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",58
"59","16848. How much of the 890 acres of reclaimed land was given to crofters ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",59
"60","—I cannot say.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",60
"61","16849. The half of it ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",61
"62","—Scarcely. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",62
"63","16850. Have you any idea what the average cost per acre would be of the reclamation so as to arrive at an approximation ?",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",63
"64","—I have not made it up.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",64
"65","16851. Would it probably go from £ 10 to £20 ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",65
"66","—Some would, but a large proportion of it would be less.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",66
"67","16852. Would you said £15? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",67
"68","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",68
"69","16853. What I want to get at is this, what really has been expended, as it may be called, for benefit of the crofters ? There has been £99,000 expended by   Sir James altogether, but I want to arrive at what was the amount expended by the proprietor upon those lands that are now in the possession of the crofters? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",69
"70","—£1500.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",70
"71","16854. That is for new townships? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",71
"72","—New townships.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",72
"73","16855. Is that all? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",73
"74","—Well, there is some done upon old townships, but not a great deal.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",74
"75","16856. Would there be as much again as other £1500 on the other townships ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",75
"76","—It would not exceed that.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",76
"77","16857. You take credit for £25,000 having been spent by Sir James upon roads, but, according to the testimony of almost all the delegates, the sum of 5s. has   been placed upon them for road money, which is paid to this day in the form of rent ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",77
"78","—That is statute labour, but it is not included in the £25,000. They pay it either in labour or money.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",78
"79","16858. Upon what roads was that statute labour expended? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",79
"80","—Principally in making township roads for the crofters.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",80
"81","16859. But surely that has expired long ago ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",81
"82","—Not now.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",82
"83","16860. But you are charging them 5s. ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",83
"84","—It is included in the rental.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",84
"85","16861. I must ask you some questions about the statistics you gave at Uig. I want to ascertain a point with regard to a road as to which a great complaint   was made by the people, and also about the position of the school. What were the circumstances under which the school was placed where it is at Uig ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",85
"86","—The first School Board had selected a site to the west of the church. The school was contracted for to be built there, and at the time of commencing   operations it turned out that the site was upon the glebe, and it could not be built there. The board had to select another site. A committee,of the board   was appointed to select a site, and they did so by selecting a site some 200 or 300 yards to the east of the church.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",86
"87","16862. Is that the present site? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",87
"88","—That is the present site?  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",88
"89","16863. Was the board unanimous about the alteration? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",89
"90","—They were not.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",90
"91","16864. Did this alteration postpone the building of the school for a considerable period ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",91
"92","—I don't think it did.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",92
"93","16865. Did you lose a year's Government grant in consequence of the delay that took place? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",93
"94","—No, the school was contracted for on the glebe site, and the board could not change the site—that is, to put it further from the road—without paying  compensation to the contractor.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",94
"95","16866, About the constitution of the board; you are chairman, I believe, of all the boards ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",95
"96","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",96
"97","16867. And I think you stated at Uig that you did not think the representatives of the crofting interest in Uig were people who gave very much assistance in   the conduct of the business of the board ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",97
"98","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",98
"99","16868. Are you aware that some of the present teachers in Uig are the children of crofters ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",99
"100","—Yes, I know two of them who are.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",100
"101","16869. Is there a member of the School Board at present who cannot read or write ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",101
"102","—I don't think there is.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",102
"103","16870. Do you not think that it would be an advantage to have on the board some representative of the crofting interest who pay half at least, if not more,   of the rates ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",103
"104","—Well, I don't see they would do much good.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",104
"105","16871. Can you tell me the number of townships in the parish of Uig which have been depopulated and the crofters removed ? Am I safe in saying there were   forty townships ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",105
"106","—Not in Sir James' day.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",106
"107","16872. But can you say there were forty townships once in existence and not there now ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",107
"108","—I cannot say.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",108
"109","16873. How often are the paupers of Uig paid their allowances? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",109
"110","—Every two months, I think.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",110
"111","16874. Are you sure it is not every three months ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",111
"112","—It may be ; some of the parishes are two months and some three.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",112
"113","16875. Have any complaints reached your ear about the doctor at Uig? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",113
"114","—Not of late, but there were some time ago.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",114
"115","16876. Did you take means to put that right so far as you could? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",115
"116","—I took this means, that I wished the people to put in a formal complaint to the board, but it never came.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",116
"117","16877. And you have not heard any complaint recently ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",117
"118","—Not recently.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",118
"119","16878. There was a complaint made about a road. Will you explain how it was that you changed the road which had been at one time agreed to be made in Uig with some of the destitution money ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",119
"120","—Well, the road is not made yet, but the difference betweeu us is just as to the line of the road. Mr M'lver, I believe, was for one line, and I was for another. That is all the difference, if it ever should be made.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",120
"121","16879. Did you yourself refuse any meal to people in the parish of Uig when they came to you on any occasion and under any circumstances? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",121
"122","—I did.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",122
"123","16880. Will you explain why? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",123
"124","—What is referred to, I suppose, is the township of Kneep. There is a large fence between the township of Kneep and the township of Reef, which was blown down partly by a gale. I sent men to repair it, but what was built during the day would be knocked down during the night. It continued so for some time. I offered these people who applied for meal that they should go and work at this dyke, and I would pay them for it, but till they did so I would not give them meal.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",124
"125","16881. Were you aware at the time that they were in absolute destitution? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",125
"126","—No, I do not believe they were.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",126
"127","16882. You did not consider so at the time? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",127
"128","—No.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",128
"129","16883. And you have not now been made aware that they were? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",129
"130","—No, I have not.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",130
"131","16884. Was there any talk among those in authority who had the distribution of this destitution money that if it were paid back by the people : it should be used for the purpose of emigration? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",131
"132","—There was a talk as to what it should be applied to at the first public meeting, but the committee have not resolved upon anything. It has been left with the committee for future consideration as to what should be done with the money if any part of it is paid back.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",132
"133","16885. No resolution has been come to ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",133
"134","—Not yet.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",134
"135","16886. Are you aware that a good deal of dissatisfaction has prevailed with regard to the way the money was distributed in the different parts of the island? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",135
"136","—I quite believe that.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",136
"137","16887. You are the chairman of the fund? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",137
"138","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",138
"139","16888. You, of course, could not see to the personal application of it yourself ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",139
"140","—I have seen to the distribution of it.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",140
"141","16889. Personally? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",141
"142","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",142
"143","16890. Did you refuse anybody at all? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",143
"144","—I have refused many.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",144
"145","16891. Why?",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",145
"146","—Because I knew they did not require it at the time. I had the assistance of others. I had the assistance of the inspector of poor, and the ground officer of the district, and any member of the committee who liked to be present.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",146
"147","16892. Did you give as much as nine or ten bolls to single families? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",147
"148","—I did.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",148
"149","16893. And many got nothing? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",149
"150","—It is precious few who got not at all in the island.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",150
"151","16894. What is your opinion generally about the state of Uig? Do you consider that the people are very ill off there, or the reverse? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",151
"152","—There are many very ill off there during this year.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",152
"153","16895. Are the rents pretty well paid? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",153
"154","—Not so well as ordinarily.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",154
"155","16896. Are you aware that people have borrowed money to pay their rents ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",155
"156","—I am not aware, but there may be such cases.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",156
"157","16897. Are your regulations so stringent about the payment of rent that people are obliged to resort to every shift to bring their rent ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",157
"158","—Well, I must get in the rents.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",158
"159","16898. I suppose you have no such regulation as we have heard of in Skye, that no payment to account will be taken ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",159
"160","—Oh, no; we are glad to take a payment to account.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",160
"161","16899. You have no farm yourself? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",161
"162","—I never had an acre.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",162
"163","16900. May I take it for granted that you have no interest in any of the tacksmen ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",163
"164","—No interest whatever.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",164
"165","16901. With regard to the present position of the property, it is liferented by Lady Matheson ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",165
"166","—It is.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",166
"167","16902. With a destination to another individual? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",167
"168","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",168
"169","16903. Who pays for the expenditure of the estate or any improvements of a permanent character that need to be done, or is anything paid? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",169
"170","—There is nothing paid unless Lady Matheson likes to do it.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",170
"171","16904. Then the position at this moment is that the liferentrix may draw all the rent, and is not responsible for any outgoing? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",171
"172","—She is responsible for the ordinary upholding of the premises on the estate.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",172
"173","16905. But nothing can be expended? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",173
"174","—She can expend what she likes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",174
"175","16906. Bat there is no obligation or press are of estate interests is there is upon an ordinary proprietor? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",175
"176","—No.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",176
"177","16907. And no power to enforce it? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",177
"178","—No.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",178
"179","16908. Has the expenditure to a great extent ceased upon the property ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",179
"180","—It has.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",180
"181","16909. Did Sir James use to expend the full rental on the estate? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",181
"182","—Yes, and a great deal more.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",182
"183","16910. That is not so now? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",183
"184","—No; I believe he never pocketed a penny apart from the occupancy of the castle and the home farm. He spent the whole rental and a great deal more. Even now Lady Matheson would not pocket a penny off the Lewis estates were it not for the shooting rents.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",184
"185","16911. Can you explain how it is that the burdens have risen so enormously from £700 to £4600? The rent is only doubled, so at the most the burdens should be under £2000 ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",185
"186","—There was no poor rate in 1844, no school rate, and no road assessment.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",186
"187","16912. And these have unfortunately turned out to be excessively high in all the parishes? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",187
"188","—They have been excessively high during the years I have mentioned.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",188
"189","16913. With regard to your teachers, how is it that so few teachers who teach Gaelic have been appointed in your schools ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",189
"190","—Because we are glad to get teachers whether they have Gaelic or not. It is very difficult to get teachers to come to this part.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",190
"191","16914. Do you put into your advertisements when you ask for teachers, what is very common, that Gaelic is an essential, or is considered a great qualification? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",191
"192","—We generally put in that Gaelic would be a recommendation.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",192
"193","16915. But still you have not got any? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",193
"194","—We have some teachers, I think, who have Gaelic.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",194
"195","16916. Can you say how many teachers in the island have got Gaelic ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",195
"196","—No; there are some, but I cannot say how many.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",196
"197","16917. Have you Gaelic yourself? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",197
"198","—A sort of it.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",198
"199","16918. Now, we are well aware of the great sums of money that have been laid out on the estate in one way or other, but I have not yet been able to get from you anything that has been done for the direct benefit of the crofters in the way of expenditure, except a sum of £1500 for new townships, and a similar sum given for old townships, and except the money spent on roads and bridges? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",199
"200","—And schools, and storehouses at different places to enable the fish-curers to prosecute the fishing.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",200
"201","16919. But rent is paid for those curing stores? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",201
"202","—Yes, but if there were no storehouses there would be no fishing.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",202
"203","16920. With regard to the schools that have now become sunk in the board schools, what may have been laid out on them,—on the buildings and on the teachers?",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",203
"204","—I would not like to give figures.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",204
"205","16921. Would there be £5000 laid out on the buildings ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",205
"206","—Not so much as that.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",206
"207","16922. Would the annual allowances to the teachers amount to £300 a year ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",207
"208","—About £200 or £250.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",208
"209","16923. And probably the teachers have got croftland around their schoolhouses ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",209
"210","—Some of them have crofts, but not all.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",210
"211","16924. Are you not aware that the state of the Lewis generally in the eyes of the public is critical ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",211
"212","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",212
"213","16925. In fact, you have so stated in public? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",213
"214","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",214
"215","16926. And you have been obliged to go in consequence of that to seek aid from other quarters,—no doubt a most painful duty to you. Can you make any suggestion, whether agreeable or not to those who hear you? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",215
"216","—Well, I ascribe the present destitute state of the island to squatting or subdivision of crofts, and for that I know no remedy but emigration, and quays and harbours in several parts of the islands.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",216
"217","16927. You want quays and harbours, and emigration. Are you in favour of giving the people a chance of enlarging their crofts on some of the tacks as the leases fall out ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",217
"218","—Not enlarging the crofts, but enlarging the pastures. I don't believe they could pay for large crofts of arable land, or that they could work them.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",218
"219","16928. Would you like to see their pasture improved? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",219
"220","—Yes, to increase their pasture.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",220
"221","16929. It was stated to us by Dr Macrae that he thought some land might be taken in on the west side of the road leading down to the Ness. What do you say to that idea? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",221
"222","—A good deal has been done there by reclaiming land outside the township, but I consider it was a very great mistake. It interfered with the old crofters that were below the road. At one time there was no croft outside the road from Galston to the Butt on the right hand side going towards the Butt. They commenced to reclaim lands there, and placed squatters here in the old township. I think that was a mistake, in this respect, that it reduced the pasture of the original crofters, and placed these crofters between them and the moor pasture. Instead of reclaiming it for new crofters, it should have been reclaimed for the original crofters, so as to enlarge their lots.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",222
"223","16930. You think it would be a proper step to enlarge the crofts of those already there ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",223
"224","—Only in that district, because they have horses and they plough the land, but there are many districts where no plough can ever be.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",224
"225","16931. Do you think that by doing that they would be enabled to leave out a portion under grass, so as to recover itself ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",225
"226","—Well, they might do that.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",226
"227","16932. Is that one of the principal hardships or grievances they suffer under, that the land is running out through not having rest? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",227
"228","—There is no doubt the land would be better of having a portion left out in grass.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",228
"229","16933. Is it not the fact that as you go along on the road to Knock, where there are now beautiful fields of grass, that was all bog at one time, or mostly so ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",229
"230","—That was reclaimed long ago.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",230
"231","16934. But still it was originally bog land? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",231
"232","—It is quite possible it was.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",232
"233","16935. Is there any reason why a great deal more of that should not be taken in by small crofters, who can do it much cheaper than the proprietor can ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",233
"234","—Well, they could not do it without being paid for it. They could not do much of themselves.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",234
"235","16936. Don't you think that if the landlord or anybody else fenced it for them, they would do all the rest themselves? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",235
"236","—I don't think they could do so at present, in their present circumstances.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",236
"237","16937. You were to give us a statement of the different points round the island where you think quays or harbours would be suitable. You have not prepared that yet ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",237
"238","—No.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",238
"239","16938. The Chairman. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",239
"240","—Have not the crofters spare time at a portion of the year? Do they fish between January and sowing time? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",240
"241","—They fish in the spring, of course.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",241
"242","16939. Then they are at present occupied throughout the year, and have no odd time on their hands? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",242
"243","—Not the fishermen.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",243
"244","16940. You have been speaking of an expenditure of £1500 on the crofts, but your paper makes the expenditure £8470; which is the correct figure, £8470 or £1500? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",244
"245","—That was to 1853.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",245
"246","16941. Then up to 1853 £8400 had been expended on crofters? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",246
"247","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",247
"248","16942. And since then there has been more expended? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",248
"249","—Yes, but not much.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",249
"250","16943. There has been a question about the representatives of the crofters on the School Board. Although there are not many of the crofter class on the board, are not the members representatives of the crofters ? They have been elected in the usual way ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",250
"251","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",251
"252","16944. Have there been contests in the parishes? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",252
"253","—There have been.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",253
"254","16945. Do the crofters form a majority of the electors ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",254
"255","—They do in most parishes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",255
"256","16946. Therefore, though the members are not crofters, they are in point of fact crofters' representatives ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",256
"257","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",257
"258","16947. With regard to Kneep, where you refused to give relief except in return for employment, if the crofters had accepted this employment, how long would they have had to go on working before they received relief? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",258
"259","—If they were even three days working they would be paid for it.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",259
"260","16948. Therefore, the offer of employment was in point of fact equal to an offer of relief ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",260
"261","—It was applied as a test.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",261
"262","16949. In the statistics which you have given us you have not referred to the arrears on this property. Can you state what the arrears of rent are at the present time? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",262
"263","—The arrears of rent at 31st December last amounted to £6753.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",263
"264","16950. Can you tell me what they were twenty years ago? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",264
"265","—I believe they would be a great deal more.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",265
"266","16951. Then the arrears are. being gradually reduced? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",266
"267","—Well, twenty years ago we were purging the roll, as it were.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",267
"268","16952. And the £6753 will stand as a sort of average, year after year now ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",268
"269","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",269
"270","16953. What is the average remission of arrears of rent? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",270
"271","—It is not remitted every year, but perhaps every three years.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",271
"272","16954. Is it a growing quantity or a diminishing quantity? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",272
"273","—Since I took charge, I think it has diminished.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",273
"274","16955. Are you applying more pressure to recover rents than used to be employed ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",274
"275","—No, I am not. I mean that I have no more summonses, but I perhaps ask it oftener.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",275
"276","16956. They are not threatened with eviction more frequently than they used to be? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",276
"277","—No, but they are told when they are two years past due, and third year running, that they must quit.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",277
"278","16957. Is it your practice to carry out that rule? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",278
"279","—No, I have not carried it out.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",279
"280","16958. Then what I want to arrive at is this,",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",280
"281","—judging by their arrears of rent, do you think the circumstances of the people are improving or deteriorating?",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",281
"282","—I don't think they are improving. There are a greater number of poor people among them now than there used to be.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",282
"283","16959. Mr Cameron. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",283
"284","—We have heard a good deal about evictions—not so much in evidence given before us as in the public newspapers; can you state anything with regard to evictions during the time of your connection with the estate ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",284
"285","—Some have been deprived of land on account of arrears. For instance, when I began to take charge there was one tenant who had not paid a penny for twenty-five years.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",285
"286","16960. How many years is it generally the practice to allow arrears of rent to run before measures are taken to evict a tenant ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",286
"287","—My instructions from Sir James were that when two years were past due, and the third year was running, the tenant must quit.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",287
"288","16961. Have any evictions taken place on a wholesale scale connected with the estate ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",288
"289","—Not since I had to do with it—not for the last eight years.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",289
"290","16962. Has anything of that kind taken place during the last twenty years? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",290
"291","—No, except the emigration from the townships that were cleared. A proportion of the people of these townships emigrated.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",291
"292","16963. What became of the remainder? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",292
"293","—They were provided with bigger crofts in other parts—in this new land that was taken in.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",293
"294","16964. How were the people selected for emigration? Were they taken according to the age of the head of the family, or how ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",294
"295","—I cannot speak about the townships that were cleared during Mr Munro Mackenzie's time, but the only township cleared during Mr Munro's time was that of North Galston or New Galston, and there was a petition from the people asking to be sent to America.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",295
"296","16965. Do you know whether that petition was largely signed or not? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",296
"297","—I cannot say.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",297
"298","16966. But it was considered bona fide at the time? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",298
"299","—It was.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",299
"300","16967. How were the people selected for emigration? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",300
"301","—It was understood they were all to go, and a vessel was engaged to take them to America; but many of them latterly refused to go after agreeing to go, and they were taken from any township or any place. Any person who was willing to go was taken in order to fill up, and those who refused to go were placed in the crofts that were vacated.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",301
"302","16968. I gather from that statement that the emigration was purely voluntary? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",302
"303","—It was voluntary at first, but no doubt every means was brought to bear upon them to go after they had agreed to go.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",303
"304","16969. And this place was made a tack of? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",304
"305","—It was added to the farm of Galston.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",305
"306","16970. Were there any other wholesale clearances during the time you William remember? I think you stated that during your occupancy of the office of chamberlain there had been none at all ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",306
"307","—That is so.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",307
"308","16971. But during the time you remember were there any others? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",308
"309","—Yes, there were Reef, and Carinish, and North Tolsta.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",309
"310","16972. Do you think this clearance at Galston has had any effect in making the people unwilling to entertain the idea of emigration ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",310
"311","—I don't think it.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",311
"312","16973. You are aware that there is a very strong feeling against emigration in the island? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",312
"313","—I believe there is so amongst some; still, I believe, if there was free emigration, and people were assisted, they would emigrate. A number emigrated this same year.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",313
"314","16974. Don't you think there lingers in the mind of the people an idea that emigration means forced emigration, and that they do not draw a distinction between forced emigration and voluntary emigration ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",314
"315","—I quite believe that.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",315
"316","16975. Do you consider that, provided an opportunity was offered to the crofters, with proper guarantees that they would be made secure in their holdings, they would be willing to improve waste land? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",316
"317","—No, I don't think they would.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",317
"318","16976. It was stated by Dr Macrae, that if money was found from some source or another, and the crofters were given security in the possession of the land which they were to improve, they would be found willing and desirous to occupy their spare time in bringing the land into cultivation? Do you concur in that view? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",318
"319","—Not at their own expense; if they were paid for it.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",319
"320","16977. You think that if they were paid for their labour,—that is to say, if they were encouraged to improve the land,—they would be found willing to accept any such offer ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",320
"321","—What I mean to say is this,—if a man got payment for his labour on the land as he brought it in, without waiting for compensation.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",321
"322","16978. But if the land was improved by money found from outside sources, would the tenant be inclined to improve the land, and to pay interest on the money so expended? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",322
"323","—I believe he would, but it would be ultimately a very high rent. The improvements made by Sir James cost more than the tenant could do for himself had he paid for it.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",323
"324","16979. I presume improvements made by the proprietor are always charged with interest? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",324
"325","—I should think so, but there has been nothing done here on which interest has been charged for many years. Not since 1853.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",325
"326","16980. But if improvements are made, aud no interest is charged, it ceases to be improvements in the ordinary sense of the word, and then becomes pure charity ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",326
"327","—So it does.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",327
"328","16981. With regard to subdivision, the great evils of subdivision have been fully brought before us, and we have endeavoured to ascertain how these might be prevented in future. Have you any suggestion to make on that head ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",328
"329","—In regard to this island, I do not see how it is possible to prevent it without free emigration.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",329
"330","16982. The regulations of the estate, I presume, prevent subdivision, or are intended to prevent it ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",330
"331","—They forbid subdivision, but how are you to prevent it ?  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",331
"332","16983. I suppose a factor who endeavoured to enforce these regulations strictly, would be looked upon as very hard-hearted ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",332
"333","—He would.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",333
"334","16984. Do you think the people themselves see the necessity of helping the factor and authorities in keeping the crofts of a size that would support a family? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",334
"335","—Some of the old men, when spoken to by themselves, admit the impropriety of it, but still they give their consent to it when sons and daughters get married.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",335
"336","16985. With reference to Lady Matheson's position in regard to the estate, I suppose there is no obligation on any ordinary proprietor to make improvements, whether he holds in fee simple or under entail? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",336
"337","—No.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",337
"338","16986. You stated that Lady Matheson would derive no revenue from this estate, were it not for the rents from the shooting tenants. Can you tell us how the rates and public burdens are affected by the shootings ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",338
"339","—The additional rate that would be required, if the shootings were not let, in the parish of Uig, would be 4s. 5d. per pound—2s. 2|d. on proprietors, and the same on tenants.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",339
"340","16987. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",340
"341","—But that is presuming that no use whatever is made of the ground? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",341
"342","—No, I am only deducting the shooting rental.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",342
"343","16988. Not the forest rental?",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",343
"344","—Forest and shootings. In the parish of Lochs it would necessitate an additional rate of 3s. 7½d; in Barvas, an additional rate of Is. 2¼d; and in the parish of Stornoway, 10 3/4d.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",344
"345","16989. Does that mean, if you strike off the total rent of shooting and forest? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",345
"346","—Strike off the shooting and forest rent for the rental of the parish.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",346
"347","16990. But then don't you see that the deer forests might let as grazing ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",347
"348","—But the rental would not be so large.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",348
"349","16991. Mr Cameron. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",349
"350","—It comes to this, that you would have to add something for the value of the grazing of the forest, but with regard to the other shootings it would be all clean loss ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",350
"351","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",351
"352","16992. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",352
"353","—Has any one found fault, so far as you are aware, with the grouse shootings ? The general public don't want to drive away the sportsmen ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",353
"354","—I never heard any complaints.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",354
"355","16993. Mr Cameron. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",355
"356","—You had brought under your notice a petition from the crofters of Lewis, and the third paragraph states that there are nine shootings and salmon fishings let to sportsmen who do not reside permanently on the island, and who pay rents ranging from £150 to £1000. You are aware that is one of the grievances? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",356
"357","—I am not aware that the crofters ever made a grievance of it, but it is a great advantage so far as the rates are concerned.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",357
"358","16994. Professor Mackinnon. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",358
"359","—You say there are over 240,000 acres under crofts, and 158,000 acres under forests and farms. All over the island, so far as we have gone yet, having heard the claim made by those who have crofts for double and treble their sizes, and of those who have no crofts to get crofts, are you prepared to say that these forests and large farms, if relotted out, would not provide every one of the present population with a suitable size of croft? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",359
"360","—No, I don't think it would afford crofts to the present population on which they could live comfortably.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",360
"361","16995. You stated you thought the policy of reclaiming the cul and giving it to additional tenants a mistake, and that you thought it would not pay as an arable farm. Dr Macrae stated that he thought if it was enclosed it would pay as grazing, and that the increased grazing would recoup the expense, more or less ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",361
"362","—To the present tenants who are tenants in any township, if they themselves brought it in, or if it was brought in for them, but not if additional crofters were placed upon it.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",362
"363","16996. I don't mean that additional crofters should be placed upon it. Do you think it would pay to reclaim it for grazing ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",363
"364","—I have no doubt it would, but I would not place additional crofters upon it.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",364
"365","16997. You would rather undo what in that respect has been already done in cutting out new crofts ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",365
"366","—That was a mistake.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",366
"367","16998. And you would rather undo it? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",367
"368","—What I say is that the land should be given to the original crofters, increasing the original crofts.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",368
"369","16999. One great grievance of the crofters was that this piece of pasture was taken from them, and no abatement made in the rent. Do you not consider that that was a grievance ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",369
"370","—I admit that. I admit it was a mistake to put the original crofters there at all.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",370
"371","17000. According to their own statement, it worked in another way. The pasture was made less, the number of crofts was increased, the summing remained the same, and now the one who can afford it has perhaps the old summing on the grazing at the expense of his neighbour who has less stock, and they complain that the cattle and the sheep are very much worse. Don't you think it would be a very desirable thing that the summing, even supposing things remained the same, should be reduced to reasonable proportions, so that no man should keep except what his grazing would enable him adequately to support ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",371
"372","—Well, the summing was reduced when the new regulations were issued. Formerly people were under the impression that they were entitled to have five Cheviot or seven blackfaced sheep and one cow and a follower. As the regulations were read, it was one cow and a follower or five Cheviot sheep.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",372
"373","17001. Don't you think in some places, whatever the regulations are, some of them keep the cow and the five sheep ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",373
"374","—And some of them a great deal more.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",374
"375","17002. Then it is not a matter of making new regulations, but enforcing the existing regulations ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",375
"376","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",376
"377","17003. According to the present rules of the property, one is not deprived of his holding till he is three years in arrears, and you stated tint even that is not carried into effect, so that practically, as matter of fact, there is the security that was asked for by legislation the other day, the statement being that it should be secured by statute that no man should be deprived of his croft till he was three or four or five years in arrear. The present rule is three years, and that is not even acted upon ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",377
"378","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",378
"379","17004. So you are better than the proposed law in that case? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",379
"380","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",380
"381","17005. Are you able to tell us the rent of the shooting that has no stock upon it except deer—where crofters are not allowed to put their stock ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",381
"382","—Morsgiel is in the valuation roll at £950; Scaliscroft, £160; Arnish, a small place the grazing rental of which before was £50, and which is in the proprietor's hands; and Aline, £400.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",382
"383","17006. That is all under deer, and no other stock allowed upon it, and it gives a rental of about £2000 in the various parishes. How much rent would you expect to get for that land, supposing it were let for grazing purposes ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",383
"384","—£550.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",384
"385","17007. You stated that so far as you were aware there was no extensive clearing made except either when the people were in arrear or except where the places were unsuitable for cultivation. Is it not the case that a considerable number of the large farms throughout the estate were cultivated as small crofts to advantage in former times ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",385
"386","—I believe most of them had crofters at one time or other.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",386
"387","17008. And they could be cultivated to advantage yet in the same way ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",387
"388","—Well, there are some of them in which there is very little arable land, or land which could be made arable. In others a considerable proportion might be cultivated.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",388
"389","17009. And others again have a considerable proportion of arable land that has been very much improved ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",389
"390","—Yes.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",390
"391","17010. When you stated there was no forced emigration, I suppose you meant that the people were not removed through process of law ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",391
"392","—Quite so.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",392
"393","17011. The people who remained of course stated that those who went away went sorely against their own will, but still there was no process of law ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",393
"394","—The only emigration I saw was from Galston, and I know there was not even a summons.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",394
"395","17012. You stated that there were letters in your possession which described the position of those people after they went away. Are any of these letters of recent date ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",395
"396","—They are principally from tenants who emigrated in 1851 and 1852.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",396
"397","17013. A gentleman stated on Saturday his belief that the present condition of those who went away thirty years ago is worse than the condition of their neighbours in the island of Lewis at the present moment. Have you any means of forming an opinion as to the accuracy of that? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",397
"398","—It is inaccurate. I have seen many who returned from Canada to the island, and heard their statements as to their condition, and my opinion is that they are much better off than if they had remained in the Lewis.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",398
"399","17014. Have any of these returned permanently to the place? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",399
"400","—There were two men I know who returned, but one of them left his family there.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",400
"401","17015. There was just one statement of an alleged grievance in connection with which your own name was quoted. At Breasclete some tenants stated they were removed to Dun of Carloway, and because of their former experience they wanted to have a written engagement that people should not be thrown in upon them, and that they should not be deprived of pasture land, and your own name was quoted as being aware of that written agreement which was afterwards lost ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",401
"402","—I am not aware of there having been a written agreement, but I am aware of the factor for the time being saying to them that whoever would be placed into those parks would not have the right of pasture below the road, between them and the sea.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",402
"403","17016. Has that agreement been kept ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",403
"404","—Yes, it has been keep for nineteen years. These have no pasture below the road. The whole township lies between the road and the sea, and the two who were placed into the parks have not been allowed to pasture between the crofts and the sea, but they are to have the privilege of pasturing their cow on the outside.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",404
"405","17017. You heard the statement of Dr Macrae on education, and his belief that to secure regular attendance it would be better to try rewards for those who did attend regularly than to punish the parents of those who did not. Are you prepared to accept that ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",405
"406","—I am.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",406
"407","17018. Is that regulation as to punishing those parents by adding to their rent still in force ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",407
"408","—No.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",408
"409","17019. I think you stated the other day that there was some money recovered under that process ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",409
"410","—There was.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",410
"411","17020. What fund did it go to? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",411
"412","—To the School Board.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",412
"413","17021. What would be done to any one who declined to pay that sum? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",413
"414","—I don't know what we might do in that case.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",414
"415","17022. All those who were asked paid it? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",415
"416","—Yes; but it was not for non-attendance that they were made to pay, but for withholding the children from the examination.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",416
"417","17023. Sheriff Nicolson. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",417
"418","—There was rather an extraordinary thing told us on Saturday about the destruction of the pier at Bayble. You heard what was said. Can you give any explanation of it ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",418
"419","—The only explanation I can give is that the greater part of the pier was swept away many years ago. I saw that myself, and I have been speaking to some of the men since then, and they admitted that the outer end of it was swept away. The stones were strewn on the beach, and our clerk of works requiring some good stones took some of them off the beach, and that only improved the beach, because the stones might have injured the boats. He did not take any stones off the quay, but off the beach.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",419
"420","17024. Was the quay built by Sir James? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",420
"421","—Well, I know he paid something for it, and that he had a man working there. It was said here that every crew paid £1 to Mr Methven, the fish-curer. I cannot speak to that, but I know that Sir James paid a man for working there for a considerable time.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",421
"422","17025. Do you know how long the stones were so lying? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",422
"423","—For many years. The work was done about 1845 or 1846. It was a slip for boats.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",423
"424","17026. Stones are scarce in that district? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",424
"425","—Good stones are.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",425
"426","17027. So for the repair of the pier it would be difficult to get them anywhere else ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",426
"427","—There is a good quarry at hand.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",427
"428","17028. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",428
"429","—All over the island we have had a very good account of you as chamberlain, but I am obliged to ask you this question ? Have you ever threatened to turn out a crofter for refusing to maintain a person whom he was not legally bound to support? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",429
"430","—I cannot recollect of doing such a thing.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",430
"431","17029. The person is John Matheson, tenant at Aird, Uig, and the letter is as follows :  —Chamberlain's Office, Stornoway, 12th May 1881. —Sir, The fact of your having made a claim against the Parochial Board of Uig, for the support and maintenance of your idiotic sister's illegitimate child, I made known to Lady Matheson, and she was so horrified at the very idea, of you and your father making such a claim, seeing you are in position to support this child. I was instructed to make an entry in our books, that on the death of your father, should you survive him, that you are not to be continued thereafter as tenant of the croft you now occupy at Aird Uig, jointly with your father, in the event of your persisting in this claim against the board. Though you may not be legally bound for the support of this child, yet, considering the unfortunate circumstances connected therewith and your own and your father's ability to support the child, it was mean and unnatural to charge the board for the short period the child was left with its mother, and you should have been satisfied when the board relieved you of the child, which at first was all you wanted, not on the plea that you were not able to support the child, but that the child could not be left in charge of the mother, and there was no other person in the family who could take charge, —Yours truly, WM MACKAY. —Mr John Matheson, Tenant, Aird Uig.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",431
"432","—That is quite correct. I think it was anything but right in these circumstances to the party that they should have thrown that child upon the board.  ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",432
"433","17030. You said, in answer to my inquiry about what was laid out in the Parish of Uig, that there was a shooting lodge built there, which gave some labour at the time. Is it the fact that that lodge was built on the ground of the crofters ? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",433
"434","—No, it was built on the ground of the tacksman. ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",434
"435","17030. And not on the ground of the crofters? ",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",435
"436","—No, it was not.",305,"William Mackay","Lewis, Stornoway",436
