"1","RANALD MACDONALD, Crofter, Aird (65)—examined.",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",1
"2","11908. The Chairman.—Have you been freely elected a delegate?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",2
"3","—Yes.",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",3
"4","11909. How many people elected you?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",4
"5","—About thirty or thirty-two families.",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",5
"6","11910. What statement have you to make to the Commissioners?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",6
"7","—The smallness of the land, the dearness of the land, the poor quality of the land, and the difficulty of having access to pure water, are the chief grievances of our township. A considerable proportion has been taken from our township. In the time of Clanranald a large proportion of the moorland was reclaimed by our  forefathers, on understanding that it should remain their own land; but this same ground has since been taken from us and added to the tack of Nunton, both on the hill and at the macher high ground and low ground. On the portion of macher which has been cut away from us we feel more, as we have to erect a dyke to keep it in proper order, and to prevent our cattle straying, and to keep cattle on the other side from straying on ourselves. There was a large portion of the hill ground to which we used to drive our cattle, after the spring work was finished, and keep them there in shielings until the time of the year when there was sufficient pasture on the old machers to support our cattle. Some of the people of their own accord, on account of the exhaustion of the macher lands, left those and voluntarily took up stances on their hill grounds. The land reclaimed by those settled upon the moorland was added to the tack as already mentioned, and those people who had settled upon it were emigrated. The portion of the hill ground which was reclaimed, and which was not added to the neighbouring tack of Nunton, was peopled by'about fourteen cottars, who now pay a small rent. On the machers, where we have built our houses, we have no pure water. It is extremely brackish, and exceedingly injurious to cattle.",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",7
"8","11911. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—I suppose there never was any better water ?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",8
"9","—No, not of the same quality to-day. There was a loch which has been drained, but this good water is a considerable distance from our houses; the portion of land which I have already stated is occupied by a small class of cottars or tenants, who pay a small rent, and we find it very difficult to get access to the water.",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",9
"10","11912. You say the land is dear. What rent do you pay?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",10
"11","—£7, 10s.",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",11
"12","11913. How many acres do you cultivate?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",12

"14","11914. What stock do you keep?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",14

"16","11915. Has your rent ever been raised?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",16

"18","11916. What was your rent at one time?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",18
"19","—£10, when the valuation was based upon kelp sales.",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",19
"20","11917. How long is it since it was reduced ?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",20
"21","—About four years ago it was reduced to £7, 10s.",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",21
"22","11918. How long is it since you lost the land?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",22

"28","11921. Was any reduction given at that time?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",28
"29","—No.",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",29
"30","11922. Has there been a piece of land taken from you since then?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",30
"31","—A piece of land which we also reclaimed has been settled upon a small class of tenantry who now pay rent. This piece of land was taken from my own township, also a piece of our macher ground has been given to that small class of tenants in order to make potatoes.",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",31
"32","11923. Was that given to them at the time the rents were reduced?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",32

"42","11928. Have the people of your township the means to stock a larger farm?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",42
"43","—Some have, and some have not, but even those who have not expend as much money in buying meal and food for their cattle as would enable them to stock a larger farm.",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",43
"44","11929. The money they expend on meal they gain by their labour outside Benbecula, I suppose ?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",44
"45","—Some earn it outside Benbecula. There are some militia men; others go abroad and earn money, and bring it home to help their parents. ",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",45
"46","11930. Sheriff Nicolson.—Has the style of living of the people here become worse since your earliest recollection ?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",46

"57","—There may be some of that class in Benbecula, but I cannot at present recollect any.",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",57
"58","11936. They chiefly live upon meal that comes from the south?",206,"Ranald Macdonald","Benbecula, Torlum",58
