"1","WALTER TRAILL DENISON, Farmer, West Park, Cross (53)—examined.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",1
"2","23393. Mr Cameron.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",2
"3","—We shall be glad to hear any remarks you may wish to make?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",3
"4","—I should say I came here entirely unprepared to make any statement, or I should have been better able to answer any questions which may be put to me. At the same time I don't think the  Commissioners have had properly represented to them the state and working of things in former times, so that you can hardly judge of their present condition. From all the evidence you have heard, to day I don't think you have got a proper account of how matters stood say eighty years ago, when the improvement in agriculture began; and that must be taken into account, I think, before you can judge of the conduct of proprietors.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",4
"5","23394. Where is your farm?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",5
"6","—In Cross parish.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",6
"7","23395. What is the size of it?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",7
"8","—Some where about 300 acres.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",8
"9","23396. Is it an arable farm entirely or part pasture and part arable?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",9
"10","—Mixed—grain and cattle.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",10
"11","23397. Is it worked on the five-shift rotation?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",11
"12","—Yes.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",12
"13","23398. What breed of cattle do you keep 1",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",13
"14","—Crosses or shorthorn or the old Orkney breed.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",14
"15","23399. How long have you been on the farm?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",15
"16","—Since 1851.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",16
"17","23400. You are a native of this island?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",17
"18","—I am.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",18
"19","23401. And you are well acquainted with the circumstances of the people, both the large and the small farmers?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",19
"20","—I don't know. I am pretty well acquainted with the old system, because from my antiquarian tastes I have given a good deal of attention to the old system in Orkney.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",20
"21","23402. I have no doubt what you could tell us would be very interesting?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",21
"22","—Yes, but that would take too long time.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",22
"23","23403. But the work the Commission has to do is more connected with the present system?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",23
"24","—Yes, but before you can judge of the conduct of proprietors in dealing with crofters, you would require to know something of what they had to do. I don't wish to force it upon you.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",24
"25","23404. As you have been here resident in the island, occupying a large farm since 1851, I am sure you are able and willing to give us what information you have relating to the present system of affairs?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",25
"26","—Yes, I don't believe there is living a man more anxious than I am for the welfare of the Orcadians.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",26
"27","23405. You have been present at our meeting to-day and have heard the evidence given by the delegates of the crofters?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",27
"28","—I have. ",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",28
"29","23406. Does it occur to you to make any remark, which may arise spontaneously, upon the evidence?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",29
"30","—One remark shocked me very much, but it was more a personal matter, and that was what was said about Dr Traill. It was stated that his conduct was tyrannical, and that I cannot believe from the nature of the man. He is well known as a most mild and generous man by all who know him; and the remark which was made struck me as being the most ridiculous thing I heard. I don't wish to go over the whole of the things that were said.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",30
"31","23407. With regard to the rents of the crofts and the comparisons that have beeu established between the rents paid by the crofters and the rents paid by the large farmers, is it your opinion that the crofters pay as high or higher or lower rents than large farmers do?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",31
"32","—If you will allow me to confine myself to my own district I will gave you facts. My brother and I took the farm of West Burgh in 1851 at £160, and all the land at that time was in a state of cottarage. I don't think you understand that. Colonel Balfour was anxious to improve the labouring classes, and arranged so that they rented from himself instead of holding from the tenant, except in the case of three cottars on our farm. Our land was rented in 1851, and so was that of all the crofters, and their rents where there has been no vacancy and where they have not offered higher rents themselves, are all now what they were then while our rent has been increased from £160 to £220.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",32
"33","23408. So that while your rent has increased from £160 to £220, the rent of the crofters in your immediate neighbourhood has remained stationary?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",33
"34","—Yes, except on those crofts which may have become vacant and the crofters offered a rise themselves.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",34
"35","23409. That is, with the exception of those cases where there were changes in the holdings?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",35
"36","—Yes ; others have remained as they were in 1851.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",36
"37","23410. Have you observed any improvement in the system of agriculture adopted by the crofters in your neighbourhood?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",37
"38","—Most assuredly; and that is one great argument in favour of large farms, that mostly all the improvements have been and will be introduced by large farmers; for instance, the breed of cattle could not have been improved unless by the introduction of shorthorn bulls by the proprietors or large farmers.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",38
"39","23411. The improvement you have noticed in the system of agriculture pursued by the crofters, was, in a great measure, owing to the example given them by large farmers and by the assistance offered to them in improving the breed of cattle?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",39
"40","—Yes. Of course they pay for any assistance they get in that way, but I think the example of the large farmers has done a great deal.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",40
"41","23412. Did they do nothing more than show an example?—Did they give any assistance in the shape of an improved breed of bulls?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",41
"42","—The system I have is that the crofters pay for that.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",42
"43","23413. But they have derived some advantage from the improved breed of cattle introduced by large farmers?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",43
"44","—Most assuredly they have.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",44
"45","23414. In regard to the mode of cultivating their land do you notice any improvement among the crofters since 1851?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",45
"46","—Yes. When we came to our farm in 1851 there were two acres of turnips on it, and I don't know if the crofters—I don't remember —had more than you could plant in a patch in a garden, and now they all have a regular proportion of turnip crop to feed their cattle during winter. They sell some of their cattle, year olds and two-year olds. On our farm we have on an average 40 acres of turnip.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",46
"47","23415. The crofter's holdings are all enclosed by fences?-",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",47
"48","— Yes.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",48
"49","23416. Their arable land?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",49
"50","—-No.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",50
"51","23417. Their pasture land is not enclosed?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",51
"52","—No.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",52
"53","23418. We heard that the boundaries of the pasture land were marked off by stones or marks of some kind and not by fences?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",53
"54","—Not by fences.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",54
"55","23419. Is that the cause of any disagreement amongst them?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",55
"56","—Not that I am aware of, because they all tether their cattle. The crofters in my district have also a small park which they rent, but I think they generally tether in it as well.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",56
"57","23420. Do the crofters in your district keep any sheep?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",57
"58","—I think so, but not a large number.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",58
"59","23421. What breed are they?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",59
"60","—Crosses with Leicester and Cheviot, and then they are crossed in and in; perhaps a shepherd would not say that was the proper word.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",60
"61","23422. They work their land on the five-shift rotation?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",61
"62","—Generally they do. Some of us work on the six-shift where there is a large supply of sea-weed, which enables us to take two crops of grass.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",62
"63","23423. With regard to the cottar system, you have heard the evidence given by one of the more recent witnesses that the cottars object to holding land under a large tenant rather than under the landlord, and being compelled to work for the tenant at a fixed rate of wages; does that go on at all in your neighbourhood?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",63
"64","—Oh; Yes.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",64
"65","23424. What is your opinion about it?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",65
"66","—I don't see how the large farms could be well wrought without labourers. The history of that with regard to our farm is this; there are ten or eleven crofters and they were obliged to work to us when we wanted a hand on the large farm; but an they have improved in circumstances and the price of cattle has risen they have nearly all refused to work and we have not enforced it. In 1851 when we came to the place they were all anxious for the work. I have only enforced the work in the case of three who are cottars on my own farm. I distinguish those who hold from the tenant as cottar, and those who hold from the landlord as crofters.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",66
"67","23425. What did you do for labour when these crofters refused to work?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",67
"68","—Did without them, and fell back on my own three. I did not enforce it on them so strictly at first, but when the others refused I fell back on them.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",68
"69","23426. Do you think if the cottars were to hold directly from the landlord without any restriction as to labour, that the farmer and cottar would be able to arrive at a satisfactory understanding between themselves as to the labour and the price to be paid for it ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",69
"70","—I don't think so, because if the cottar was well off and getting good prices he would refuse to work at a reasonable wage; that is my opinion.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",70
"71","23427. But where else could he get work ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",71
"72","—He would not need to work if he succeeded other ways.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",72
"73","23428. Are the crofts sufficiently large to maintain a family without anything else ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",73
"74","—I think most of them are.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",74
"75","23429. What size of crofts are they about you ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",75
"76","—I really could not say.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",76
"77","23430. What rents do they pay ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",77
"78","—Some of them £4, but I could not say exactly. Some of them are under £4.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",78
"79","23431. But a crofter could not maintain himself on a croft of that size ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",79
"80","—That depends on the quantity and quality of the land.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",80
"81","23432. But the land which he could probably occupy for so small a rent, unless it was a very low rent, would hardly enable him to support himself?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",81
"82","—- It Is a very invidious thing to say in a public place; it is regarded a most unneighbourly thing to say your neighbour's land is cheap.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",82
"83","23433. But if a crofter held direct from the landlord, would he not be compelled by force of circumstances to work somewhere? and in that case where would he find work except that of the large tenant who is his neighbour?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",83
"84","—It is a very difficult thing to deal with. I wish there was some other system, for I detest the idea of a man working for me when he is not willing to do it. But weather favourable for working on the large farm is favourable to the crofter. The three cottars on my farm I took on the express understanding that they should work for me —I told them the whole thing—and there is only one of them who has ever quarrelled about it. I threatened to rent him higher, and we had some talk about it. I always said to him. ' Put yourself in my position and see what you would do.'",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",84
"85","23434. What did he say to that?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",85
"86","—He did not say what he would do.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",86
"87","23435. Did he decline to put himself in your position?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",87
"88","—He did not say much as far as I remember.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",88
"89","23436. Taking the good side and the bad side of it, what is the impression you have of this system of cottar holdings with forced labour?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",89
"90","—I don't see how the large farmers could get on without it. I cannot imagine how Housebay, for instance, could be worked without labourers being obliged to give work to the farmer.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",90
"91","23437. Is it the custom all over the islands to work in that way?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",91
"92","—I think it is pretty generally the custom.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",92
"93","23438. But not universal?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",93
"94","—Not universal.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",94
"95","23439. Do you know how they manage in those parts where it is not the custom?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",95
"96","—They get through somehow, but I think it must be difficult. Colonel Balfour's crofters in the south part of the parish are not bound to work.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",96
"97","23440. And how do the large tenants get on there?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",97
"98","—I suppose they get on as best they can, but with difficulty I should think.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",98
"99","23441 What is the poor-rate in your parish?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",99
"100","—About Is. 2d. including school rate for the tenant; or it may be Id. more or less.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",100
"101","23442. Does that include the road rate?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",101
"102","—No, the road rate was Is in the £ 1.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",102
"103","23443. And the other two Is. 2d. or Is. 3d?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",103
"104","—Is. 2d. I think, the tenant's share of it, and the people the same, of course.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",104
"105","23444. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",105
"106","—Are you a native of Orkney?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",106
"107","—I am.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",107
"108","23445. Do your family belong to it?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",108
"109","—They do.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",109
"110","23446. For a long time?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",110
"111","—I think they came in the 16th century—at least that is the tradition—from Fifeshire.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",111
"112","23447. Do you hold any land of your own?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",112
"113","—None; I have no land right or interest except the farm I hold.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",113
"114","23448. Are you surprised that these cottars and small people who are obliged to give this labour are dissatisfied?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",114
"115","—I don't know exactly how to answer. I am not very much surprised, it is just human nature, I suppose.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",115
"116","23449. You said to one of the cottars to put himself in your place; I want you to put yourself in his place. Would you be pleased with this state of matters?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",116
"117","—It is the bargain I made. I told the men these were the rules, and he was very glad to get the place, and I would hold that as an honest man he was bound to implement his bargain.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",117
"118","23450. You said that you were not able to get labour elsewhere, and were bound to fall back upon your own three cottars?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",118
"119","—Yes.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",119
"120","23451. Are you very strict on these three people in the number of days?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",120
"121","—One of them thinks so. I don't know that I am very hard. I could not tell you the number of days I employ them in the year; I have never looked into that. ",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",121
"122","23452. Do you think it is a good system, or can be good, in these modern days when everybody should bring his labour to the dearest market, and that is perfectly understood all over the country, that there should exist a system whereby it is necessary to prop it up artificially in this form ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",122
"123","—I think it is bad, if we could only find a better. It is a most unpleasant thing to me to ask a man to work who is not willing to do it. But the man who complains was very glad to take the house at the rent he is paying, and but for the work I would get more rent for the cothouse.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",123
"124","23453. Could you get on at all on the farm without this labour, paying a smaller rent ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",124
"125","—It would be a very difficult thing, especially in the most important time when the turnips have to be thinned —very difficult indeed.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",125
"126","23454. You cannot give me a direct answer ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",126
"127","—No, because I have never tried it; I don't know. I have no permanent hirers but girls or boys to work at the turnips, unless these cottars.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",127
"128","23455. Unless the proprietor made it compulsory on the small crofters and cottars to give this labour, would the farmer get the labour ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",128
"129","—I don't think so; I cannot get it.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",129
"130","23456. What is it that makes these small people agree to this onerous condition, to give this labour?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",130
"131","—The desire to have a holding and some land.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",131
"132","23457. It is not to some extent trading upon the wishes and desires of the people to remain in the place where they have been brought up ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",132
"133","—Very likely.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",133
"134","23458. It is something like a case where their poverty but not their will consents ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",134
"135","—Very often probably.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",135
"136","23459. Have you ever been able to solve this difficult question of landlord and tenant in a satisfactory manner?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",136
"137","—Except for that one thing of asking people to work who don't want to do it, looking to the whole of Orkney, I don't know a time —and I am pretty certain I know about as much about their affairs as most people do —when labouring people in the country were better off than they are at the present moment. A class for whom I feel, and whose case has not been stated before, is the ploughmen.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",137
"138","23460. Will you state briefly what you wish to say about them ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",138
"139","—I will tell you what I wish. I wish the proprietors would make it a rule, that whenever there was a croft and house vacant on the estate, the ploughman who had been longest on the property should get the croft. It would be an inducement to the ploughman to take care and lay by something of his wages for an expected croft which he might some time get; whereas now they have no inducement to save, and are apt to be careless in their habits, owing to having no hope of rising.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",139
"140","23461. It is not a common thing for a ploughman to save a little money and take a croft ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",140
"141","—In some cases it is.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",141
"142","23462. But no such inducement has been held out by proprietors ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",142
"143","—I don't think it has ever been published as a rule on any estate that I am acquainted with, and that is what I should like it to be. I think it would do a great deal of good to that class.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",143
"144","23463. And a ploughman who has been upon a big farm, is a very likely man to improve a small croft if he got it ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",144
"145","—I should say so, whereas now he has no inducement and no hope before him of rising out of his own class. He must labour hard ten hours a day, and when he becomes an old man there is very little hope for him.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",145
"146","23464. Except to fall upon the poors-roll?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",146
"147","—Yes. ",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",147
"148","23465. The training and habits of such a man are just such as would be very important upon a croft?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",148
"149","—I should say the very best. ",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",149
"150","23466. Have you heard any of them yourself express an opinion upon the subject?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",150
"151","—I dare say in the course of casual conversation I have, but I had no power to do anything.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",151
"152","23467. But your conversation with them led you to believe that they would very much like such a thing ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",152
"153","—I have no doubt they would. It might be rarely they would get such a chance, but the hope of it would have a most beneficial effect upon them and their families.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",153
"154","23468. Is the whole of this island, or nearly as much of it as can be reclaimed, already taken in ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",154
"155","—I think the greater part of it. There is a large tract of capital land in the south end given to a lot of crofters by Colonel Balfour for nothing, the ostensible reason being for drying kelp; and I don't see why the delegates don't tell the good side as well as the bad side.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",155
"156","23469. Have we had any delegates from that locality?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",156
"157","—No.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",157
"158","23470. What is the district?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",158
"159","—The south end of the island, on Colonel Balfour's property. His crofters have there, I think, from 15 to 25 acres of land for which they pay no rent at all.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",159
"160","23471. Not even Is.?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",160
"161","—I believe not.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",161
"162","23472. How long have they had it ? Did they get it upon an improving lease ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",162
"163","—I don't think they have any lease.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",163
"164","23473. Would it not be better to give them an improving lease ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",164
"165","—I think so, decidedly. But when Colonel Balfour came to the property in 1840, it was all lying in the old system, cots lying here and there and everywhere, all through the farm, and no enclosures. He wished to improve his property and he squared off the farms and freed the cottars from the old system of working. They talk about hardships now, they little know what their fathers did. I know a farm where they had to rise in the winter mornings and thresh the whole day, and their wages were nothing —all paid in kind. Colonel Balfour did away with all that system, and some of the crofters who are now complaining thought it was the best thing that could be done for them. Some of them I believe were shifted to poorer ground; some of them have capital land. I am acquainted with crofters on Colonel Balfour's estate —whose crofts if they were put into the market, would bring at once a third more than the rent they are paying.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",165
"166","23474. Is not the reason for that, not that the croft really could afford that rent but that there is a demand for a small quantity of ground?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",166
"167","—Some of them could afford it, and some of them, where the people have offered so much themselves, are rented at full value, I think.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",167
"168","23475. The Chairman.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",168
"169","—Reasoning from your own personal observations and your researches into the history of the past, do you think the labouring classes in this island now, are better off all round than they have ever been at any period ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",169
"170","—Most assuredly they are; there never was a time when Orcadians were better clad, better fed or better housed. If you were only to go 400 yards with me, I could show you a sample of the old houses; and if you had time to go through the island I could show you an old and a new house in juxtaposition, so that you could compare them. And the people know all that perfectly well. A labouring man formerly had no such thing as a leather boot or shoe, only rivellings, and they walked through wet and dry with these. I have heard them tell their hardships and they were enough to make one sick.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",170
"171","23476. Do you think the working hours of the labouring classes are now shorter and easier than they were in former times?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",171
"172","—Yes. Now they work the regular ten hours; then they had to rise—I don't say it was universal—but in winter, I know they rose in one place at four o'clock and wrought in a hot barn threshing, and an overseer was present to see that the threshing was well done. They then went home and took breakfast, and when it was light, they had to go back to the farm and work as long as it was daylight, which was a little after three o'clock.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",172
"173","23477. What were a ploughman's wages in 1851?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",173
"174","—£3, 10s. and £3, 15s. was what we paid; and we had a barn man--that is a man to superintend in the barn, and he got £4, which was considered the highest wages at the time.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",174
"175","23478. £4 in money?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",175
"176","—Yes, in the six months, and 4 stones of meal in the month, and a pint of new milk.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",176
"177","23479. Had he any cow's grass?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",177
"178","—No,",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",178
"179","23480. But take the case of a married ploughman?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",179
"180","—The first man we had, had £8. I cannot tell when that was, but I think it was sometime in 1856.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",180
"181","23481. House rent free?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",181
"182","—House rent free, which they count for nothing at all.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",182
"183","23482. How much milk?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",183
"184","—A pint  milk per diem.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",184
"185","23483. What potatoes?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",185
"186","—It was so much setting—60 chains as a rule—and he provided the seed himself.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",186
"187","23484. How many bolls of meal?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",187
"188","—Half a boll a month—6 bolls in the year; and two tons of coals a year.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",188
"189","23485. Do you think that is all?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",189
"190","—I think so.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",190
"191","23486. What does he get at this moment?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",191
"192","—I give you an average; I pay on an average £19, 10s. in money.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",192
"193","23487. And a house rent free?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",193
"194","—Yes.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",194
"195","23488. Is it a better house, or the same?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",195
"196","—The same. Of course I keep the houses in repair, at least I should do it.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",196
"197","23489. How much milk?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",197
"198","—The same —a pint.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",198
"199","23490. How many potatoes?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",199
"200","—The same of potatoes.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",200
"201","23491. And the same number of bolls of meal and the same quantity of coals?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",201
"202","—Yes.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",202
"203","23492. Then the advantage is that the money wage has been more than doubled ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",203
"204","—Yes.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",204
"205","23493. From £8 to £19, 10s.?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",205
"206","—With me that is so.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",206
"207","23494. So that he gets £11, 10s. more than he did in money. Are the expenses of a labouring man's life much increased? are the commodities he uses much dearer than they were in 1856?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",207
"208","—I don't think so. During the time of the American war cotton was much up in price; but otherwise,",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",208
"209","I don't think the commodities were dearer. I am not aware of anything that has risen in value.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",209
"210","[See Appendix A, LIX]",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",210
"211","23495. Is the daily pint of milk imperial measure or what?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",211
"212","—The Scotch pint.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",212
"213","23496. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",213
"214","—It was you who told Mr Brims about bowmen?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",214
"215","—That is my idea of the derivation of the word. But I should tell you that a much greater authority, Hill Burton, derived it from the old Scotch word boll. But we had in Orkney, in old times what they called oncalls as well, which was a different kind of service, Bowmen were exactly the same as old ploughmen. In 1706 the bowmen's wages were ten pounds Scots, and half a cow's hide for what we call shodding instead of boots or shoes, and meal and bere. The oncalls were men at the call of the farmer or proprietor. At that time proprietors in Orkney lived very much on their properties, and the system of oncalls was continued till the present century, and the oncalls had to come when there was extra work at the farm, such as taking in a stack. There was no such thing then as carting in a stack; they had all to be brought in on people's backs. And if there was any extra push in taking up sea-weed, and additional hands were required, oncalls would be called in.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",215
"216","23497. The Chairman.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",216
"217","—If there is any information you would like to give as to the ancient state of the county you would oblige us by giving it us by letter?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",217
"218","—If I had had time I would have done it before.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",218
"219","23498. But you might still do it and send it to us?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",219
"220","—I am sure I am most anxious for the benefit of my county; I am proud of my county. I don't know any county in Great Britain which has improved so much as Orkney has within the last fifty years. I am proud to see such a church as we are now assembled in, although I do not belong to the denomination.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",220
"221","23499. Was this church built by local subscription?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",221
"222","—Mostly; I think so at least. I know four-fifths of the congregation are crofters and farm servants; and it shows that the people are willing to pay for their principles.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",222
"223","23500. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",223
"224","—And pay for the land too if they could get it ?",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",224
"225","—Yes.",403,"Walter Traill Denison","Orkney, Sanday",225
