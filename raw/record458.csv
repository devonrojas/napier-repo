"1","Rev. DAVID WILLIAMSON, Minister of Assynt (84)—examined.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",1
"2","27417. Mr Cameron.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",2
"3","—How long have you been a minister in this parish?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",3
"4","—Thirty-four years. I came in the year 1849.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",4
"5","27418. Are you a native of this country?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",5
"6","—No.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",6
"7","27419. Where do you originally come from?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",7
"8","—From the parish of Cromarty.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",8
"9","27420. Can you tell us anything about the relative condition of the people now and when you first came to this parish?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",9
"10","—I don't think I can give any information in regard to the difference in their condition. They are much the same.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",10
"11","27421. Do you think there is more poverty now than there was in former times?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",11
"12","—I really cannot say; I am not much acquainted with the crofters of the parish. They are all along the coast, and I live in the middle of the country.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",12
"13","27422. Are there no crofters in your neighbourhood?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",13
"14","—Only one, and he is on the glebe. He came there in 1848, when the place was vacant, and took possession of the place his mother-in-law had, and then he took it without any leave from anyone. When I came I found him there, and he has been since then an opposition minister, and holds meetings. He wished me not to turn him off, and I said I did not want to interfere with him.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",14
"15","27423. Are you not in a position to say anything about the condition of the crofters on the coast?-",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",15
"16","—No.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",16
"17","27424. Do you think they are fond of fishing?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",17
"18","—I don't know that they are fond of fishing in general, but they don't care for any fishing almost except the herring fishing.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",18
"19","27425. Do you think they would be disposed to do more in the way of fishing if they got more assistance?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",19
"20","—Perhaps they would, they are not supposed to care very much about fishing. There are fishermen who came from the East Coast, here in summer, and other parts of the year, and they take home a great quantity of fish —a great deal of value; but the natives, I understand —I don't speak positively—don't make much in that way.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",20
"21","27426. But people on the East Coast make a great deal of money. Do you think the people here are inclined to show as much enterprise, or more, in respect to fishing than when you came to the parish?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",21
"22","—I cannot say.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",22
"23","27427. Are you a member of the School Board?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",23
"24","—Not this present board. I retired in order to prevent a contest, and I have been allowed to be out since.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",24
"25","27428. Do you wish to say anything on the state of the education of the people in the parish?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",25
"26","—The education previous to the operation of the present Act went on very well in the parish. We had society schools and assembly schools, and I don't know but the education then was to some extent more advantageous; there were more good schools, but the education was not so general. ",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",26
"27","27429. Is the parish pretty well supplied with schools now in the more remote districts?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",27
"28","—Yes, education has now reached all, except a few families of gamekeepers and shepherds, and families of that sort.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",28
"29","27430. Professor Mackinnon.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",29
"30","—You were perfectly acquainted, before you came to this parish, with an inland parish in Inverness-shire ?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",30
"31","—-Yes.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",31
"32","27431. Was there a considerable crofting community in that parish?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",32
"33","—Not a large community of crofters, it was a mixed lot of farmers that was there. There was one proprietor there, who had most of the property in his own hands—Mr Fraser—and he had a few crofters.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",33
"34","27432. Were the crofts there larger or smaller than here?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",34
"35","—My impression is that they were larger.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",35
"36","27433. And the farms smaller?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",36
"37","—Yes, and of a mixed kind. There were two or three—mostly of middle size, paying £40 or £50. It was a different community from that in this country altogether. Here we have only two classes, the crofters and the large farmers; but there there was a mixed population.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",37
"38","27434. And here there is a great gulf between the two?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",38
"39","—Yes, and that is the great evil in any country. There is little ambition to better their circumstances, whereas if there were different classes in the parish, the spirit amongst the young men would be very different. What we want here is ambition on the part of the young people to better themselves. I was always anxious to make the people discontented with their position; to get education as much as possible in order to make them try to better their circumstance, and not to be contented with the miserable living they have in this country; and sometimes parents found fault with me for being anxious to give schooling to their children. But that is long ago, and I suppose it is not so now. That was the only want we had those times, that the education was always voluntarily given.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",39
"40","27435. Do you think there were better scholars then than now?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",40
"41","—Yes.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",41
"42","27436. And all the good scholars went away?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",42
"43","—Yes, that is what we wanted.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",43
"44","27437. And did well?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",44
"45","—Yes, and did well.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",45
"46","27438. They had plenty of capacity, and plenty of ambition?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",46
"47","—Yes, I wanted the people to have ambition equal to their capacity, for certainly, taking them altogether, they are possessed of superior intellect in my opinion.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",47
"48","27439. And you wanted them to go away because there was no means of exercising that capacity you consider, at home?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",48
"49","—Yes.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",49
"50","27440. The desire of the people themselves is to get that at home; do you think that is practicable?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",50
"51","—I don't think it. If they got small holdings of £10 or £12 it would be far better than the present system, but still it would be a poor thing.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",51
"52","27441. Do you think such a community could be established as there was in Boleskine, of farms from £40 or £50 to £100?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",52
"53","—I don't see any objection to that.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",53
"54","27442. You would get a mixed community then?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",54
"55","—Yes, I think so; I think that is practicable.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",55
"56","27443. And if it were practicable at all, it would be very desirable?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",56
"57","—Yes, very, in a country that was suited for sheep farms. It is not easy to have small sheep farms; a sheep farm must be a large one, having a great variety of pasture, so that they can put all kinds of stock upon it—wedders and ewes and so forth. Small sheep farms in this country are not so easily managed; and then there is little arable land in the country generally. But if a proprietor were to set about it in earnest I think he could manage it to his own profit.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",57
"58","27444. You think it would not only be for the benefit of the people, but to the profit of the proprietor?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",58
"59","—Yes, and there is another view I have taken of these farms. When there is a large farm requiring",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",59
"60","£10,000 to stock it, very few people who would apply for it care about farming; but they have so much money which they would like to lay out that way. But if you had it in small farms of £100 to £150, there would be a great number of people in the country—men who would work the farms themselves —who would have money and would wish to take them up. I think the large farm system is an evil in this way, that it requires so much capital. And the proprietor would get more rent for a middle class of farms than for large farms; that is my idea.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",60
"61","27445. You think there would be a greater number of bidders?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",61
"62","—Yes, and for the large farms there are not many bidders.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",62
"63","27446. I suppose if there are not so many good scholars there are a greater number of children now receiving education?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",63
"64","—Yes, they are compelled; but there are not so many good scholars.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",64
"65","27447. Could both systems be combined with profit?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",65
"66","—I think so; but in the old school system we taught the clever ones, and sometimes, I have no doubt, neglected the careless ones, and let them shift for themselves.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",66
"67","27448. And now you have given a trial to the other system?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",67
"68","—Yes.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",68
"69","27449. And the stupid are to have their day?",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",69
"70","—Yes, to be sure.",458,"Rev David Williamson","Sutherland, Lochinver",70
