"1","KENNETH M'LEOD, Crofter, Garabost (54)—examined.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",1
"2","16327. Sheriff Nicolson.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",2
"3","—Your statement is as follows :",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",3
"4","—'Statement to be laid before the Royal Commission by the delegates of the Garabost crofters. When the brickwork commenced about thirty five years ago in our neighbourhood, the best part of our hill pasture was taken from us and attached to it. This was made into parks enclosed by turf dykes. These dykes we had to keep in repair till about two years ago, without receiving any wages for our labour. Paraffin oil manufacture was also for some time carried on in connection with this brickwork, and a stranger who came to superintend it got part of our pasture also; and our peat bunks were taken from us for the use of these works, and we had to cut them at a much greater distance from our houses, and sometimes the peats we cut in the latter place were carried away without our consent and without payment. One man, who cut some in the old place after we were told to give it up, had to pay a fine of £ 2 , and his rent was raised 10s., and he still pays this increase of rent which was imposed upwards of twenty years ago. If our cattle or horses entered the parks even in winter we had to pay pound money for them. The children who attended the cattle were often ill used. The new part of our township was once common pasture, and we got no reduction of rent when deprived of it, but instead of this, we had to pay 5d. once paid as road money for the almost useless park which remained. The road money is now paid by a tax of sixpence per pound of rental. The rent of the whole township now, including that of the parks and of the new part of the township, is nearly double of what it was forty years ago. Although the loss of life and property from want of proper harbour accommodation has been considerable, we got no help or encouragement from the estate for making a harbour ; and a quay which was made at Bayble by the stranger with the help of the fishermen, who contributed £ 1 per crew, was destroyed, the stones having been removed for making improvements connected with the estate. Supposing a man on the day of collecting the rents, from some unavoidable cause, failed to answer his name when called, no explanation whatever would exempt him from paying a fine of 1s. This applies only to the time of our present factor's predecessor. If any one dared to seek redress of these grievances, the uniform result was a threat to deprive him of his lands. When Kenneth M'Leod, one of the delegates, built a house on his father's croft twenty-five years ago, a fine of £ 5 was imposed, and on succeeding another crofter some time later, he had to pay £ 6 of arrears which were due by his predecessor.

"13","16330. When was it raised last?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",13

"27","16337. What had you to do with the dykes?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",27
"28","—We were so much afraid of the estate people, that we were afraid if we did not do what they liked in keeping up the dyke, we should be deprived of the small holding we had.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",28
"29","16338. Were you relieved of that two years ago ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",29

"33","16340. Were these dykes of any use to you?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",33

"35","take the water.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",35
"36","16341. Were any of your people employed on these brickworks?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",36

"40","16343. How far was it from you then?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",40
"41","—We had to go a good bit to get any peat bank.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",41
"42","16344. You speak of a man being fined £2 for cutting peats in the old place ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",42

"49","—Old Munro.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",49
"50","16348. I suppose you have no fear of that being done to you again ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",50
"51","—We are tired of that administration anyhow.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",51
"52","16349. Have they all got cows ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",52
"53","—Yes.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",53
"54","16350. How many have you yourself?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",54
"55","—Three.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",55
"56","16351. What is your rent ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",56
"57","—Including taxes, it is £ 5 , 12s. Some of them only keep two cows, some one. We are deprived of pasture land, and cannot keep stock.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",57
"58","16352. How do you manage to keep these three cows?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",58
"59","—The three would not make one good cow.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",59
"60","16353. Are you mostly fishermen ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",60
"61","—Yes, the young people.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",61
"62","16354. Is there any place in your township where a harbour could be made ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",62
"63","—Yes.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",63
"64","16355. Would the same place do for you and Bayble?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",64
"65","—Yes. It is in Bayble that we used to keep our boats.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",65
"66","16356. You say that the stones of a quay that was made there were removed and destroyed for the purpose of being used in some works connected with the estate? ",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",66
"67","—Yes, there is no doubt of that. ",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",67
"68","16357. Who did it? Where were the stones put?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",68
"69","—Many can testify as to that. There was a steamer carrying away the stones from that quay all the way to Stornoway. ",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",69
"70","16358. Was that in Sir James Matheson's time ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",70
"71","—Yes.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",71
"72","16359. Why did the people allow that to be done?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",72
"73","—We were so much depressed by the hard times we had and the administration we were under—we were so thoroughly accustomed to the word 'you will be deprived of your land.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",73
"74","16360. Do you think, if you had gone and told Sir James Matheson himself, he would have allowed such a thing to be done as destroying your pier?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",74
"75","—We cannot telL",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",75
"76","16361. You did not try?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",76
"77","—No, we never did.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",77
"78","16362. Was the quay really of any use ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",78
"79","—Yes, it was the quay where the boats used to throw out their herring. Many a score of crans of herring did I myself put ashore there.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",79
"80","16363. Did the people themselves erect the quay?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",80
"81","—It was Mr Methven that built the quay, but in order to recoup himself for his expense, he levied £1 upon every boat that was in Bayble,—£1 for",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",81
"82","once,—and that was an excellent bargain for them.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",82
"83","16364. And were the stones of that quay removed altogether?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",83
"84","—The stones were not entirely taken away ; the quay was rendered perfectly useless, for when once the sea was able to make a breach in on it, by the stones being removed, it was of no further use. (see Appendix A. XL)",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",84
"85","16365. Did you build a house on your father's croft?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",85
"86","—Yes.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",86
"87","16366. Had you any fine to pay for that liberty?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",87
"88","—I paid £ 5 of a fine.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",88
"89","16367. What was that for?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",89
"90","—When I built the house there was only my father and mother and one brother and a little sister. After building the house. I offered the factor to pull it down again if he would not impose this fine upon me, but he told me that, supposing I should pull it down, I should have to pay a fine of £4—the difference being only £ 1 . I considered it would be a very poor house indeed that was not worth that.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",90
"91","16368. Were you getting a share of your father's croft when you had this house ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",91
"92","—I had a third portion of the croft, and I was paying the rent along with my father ever since I was seventeen years of age, and helping the family.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",92
"93","16369. Did you build the house at your own expense ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",93
"94","—Yes.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",94
"95","16370. Do you remember what it cost you?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",95
"96","—I cannot tell exactly what the first house cost me, but I have an idea what my present house cost.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",96
"97","16371. How much was that?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",97
"98","—£90.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",98
"99","16372. Is it a very good house ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",99
"100","—It is a slated house.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",100
"101","16373. Was the building of your former house, for which you were fined £5. against the regulations of the estate ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",101
"102","—Probably it was at the time against the regulations of the estate; but then I offered to pull the house down, and that would not relieve me of my fine, they were so keen for it.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",102
"103","16374. Who was the factor at the time?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",103
"104","—Donald Munro.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",104
"105","16375. Have you a lease of your own present croft?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",105
"106","—No. It has certainly had to do with the character of the buildings on the estates, the little encouragement we got in these matters, and the use of that",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",106
"107","phrase I stated before—of casting up to them that they would be deprived of their land.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",107
"108","16376. What induced you to build such an expensive house?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",108
"109","—To provide a comfortable dwelling for myself and my family.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",109
"110","16377. But did you get no assurance of compensation for the value of the house ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",110
"111","—No.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",111
"112","16378. Have you any such assurance now?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",112
"113","—No; I believe that the want of such assurance prevents men from improving their dwellings in this place.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",113
"114","16379. Had you also to pay £6 of arrears for another man into whose croft you came ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",114
"115","—Yes.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",115
"116","16380. Was he any relation, of yours ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",116
"117","—No. The man who was in arrears was no relation of mine. An uncle of mine assumed this croft as joint tenant with him, and both fell into arrears, and then I had to pay his £6 of arrears before I got possession. The man fell in arrears, but there were no arrears against my uncle. ",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",117
"118","16381. You say the people are discouraged by the want of assurance of compensation; how was it that you had so much courage as to dispense with the assurance?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",118
"119","—I had some spirit to undertake the matter, but for many a long day I was looking upon it as a foolish proceeding.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",119
"120","16382. Have you ever repented of building that big house?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",120
"121","—Yes, Ihave;—when we were deprived of that back pasture land and the other matters I have mentioned.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",121
"122","16383. Has that been done since you got your house ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",122
"123","—Not altogether. Some of it was done before I built my house. Things were not so high then as they have been since I built the house.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",123
"124","16381. The Chairman.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",124
"125","—It has been represented to me that the quay which you said was destroyed for the use of the estate was broken by storms, and the stones were scattered upon the shore, before they were touched. Was that so ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",125
"126","—That is not the case. The stones were removed first, and it was the breach caused by the removal of these stones that gave the sea the advantage over it.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",126
"127","16385. It is also stated that the quay was built by Sir James Matheson, and not by Mr Methven at all ?",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",127
"128","—Of one thing I am certain, that £ 1 was laid upon every one to meet the expense of the quay, and that was paid to Mr Methven, fish-curer. We as Highlanders and Islesmen don't distrust and dislike one another at all, although we are so much crowded in upon each other. Our grievance is, that we were deprived of the lands, and that these have been given away to tacksmen, deer, and sheep. There was a dyke fence that was built between Aignish and our township, and we paid for the building of that dyke—the half of it—the tacksman paid the other half. Now, his sheep come to us when our own cattle are on the moorland pasture, and when any of ours will go to him, whether sheep or cattle or horses, he charges money for them. We cannot charge him in return ; we are so depressed that the fear of the estate management and the like of that has taken the courage out of us.",297,"Kenneth Mcleod","Lewis, Stornoway",128
