"178","—It is a good while since I had a chance to know much, but I thought they were much about the same. I did not see any difference in the goods any way I could take it. There is another thing I may mention, my chief reason for coming here was for this; we have no roads—there are twelve miles where there are no roads —and I am paying road money, and I suppose every one about us has had to pay it since 1851. Then there is a school in North Roe, but there is no road to it, and the children cannot get to it in winter time.

"191","20689. And has there ever been any proposal to make a road by them?",365,"Erasmus Doull","Shetland, Hillswick",191

"198","—At Busta.",365,"Erasmus Doull","Shetland, Hillswick",198
"199","20693. Do you find that a hardship?",365,"Erasmus Doull","Shetland, Hillswick",199
"200","—Yes; and when we require him he comes as far as the road and can get no further, and then he has to",365,"Erasmus Doull","Shetland, Hillswick",200
"201","take a boat, and perhaps he cannot get over at all.",365,"Erasmus Doull","Shetland, Hillswick",201
"202","20694. You are not obliged to pay a tax for the doctor?",365,"Erasmus Doull","Shetland, Hillswick",202
