"1","FINLAY MACKENZIE, Crofter, Tabost (53)—examined.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",1
"2","15502. The Chairman.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",2
"3","—Were you freely elected a delegate?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",3
"4","—Yes. ",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",4
"5","15503. How many people were there at your election ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",5
"6","—There were a good many. Most of the fishers were at sea.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",6
"7","15504. Will you be so good as make a statement on behalf of the people ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",7
"8","—The chief complaint of the Tabost people is the scarcity of land. Most of the land has been subdivided, and is now occupied by two families where there was one before. In 1850 I believe the number of families on the rent roll was twenty-two, and now there are at least forty-six. That came about, in the first place, by the new division of lots made, when Sir James Matheson came into the property. He made ten new lots, and the old lots were subdivided among the existing families. I have nothing more to say.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",8
"9","15505. You say there are now forty-six families, and there were formerly twenty-two. Have any of these been brought in since the lots were made from other places ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",9
"10","—One or two came from other townships in the neighbourhood.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",10
"11","15506. Then the remainder are the natural increase of the families?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",11
"12","—Yes.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",12
"13","15507. Have many of the people in Tabost availed themselves of the regulations of the estate to make improved houses ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",13
"14","—Yes, some have.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",14
"15","15508. Are there many houses in the township in which the families and the cattle live in the same room without any partition between them ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",15
"16","—Some are so ; others not.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",16
"17","15509. In other places we have generally found there is a stone partition between the cattle and the dwelling place. Was it the old fashion in Lewis not to have a partition ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",17
"18","—So far as I remember that was the old fashion. Any improvement that has been made in that respect is recent.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",18
"19","15510. Do you think it a bad thing that there should be no partition between the cattle and the family ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",19
"20","—I do.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",20
"21","15511. Would it be a good thing if there was a regulation to oblige them always to have a partition between the two ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",21
"22","—I believe it would be good for the people to do so, and in respect of that belief I have done it myself.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",22
"23","15512. What stock do you keep?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",23
"24","—Three cows, three stirks, about thirty sheep, and two horses.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",24

"26","—£7 besides taxes.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",26
"27","15514. Have you a larger amount of stock than most of the people, or is that the usual summing of a croft ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",27
"28","—I have more stock and more land than most of the people. I pay the highest rent in the place. ",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",28
"29","15515 Since you have been there has any one been evicted from the township except for non-payment of rent ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",29
"30","—No.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",30
"31","15516. Has any hill pasture been taken away since you have been there ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",31
"32","—None except what was give to the new lots.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",32
"33","15517. Where were the people brought from who have got the new lots ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",33

"35","15518. There have been no introductions from other places?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",35

"43","—Yes.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",43
"44","15522. What are the circumstances of the people just now as compared with what you remember them ? Are they better off or poorer ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",44
"45","—Surely they are poorer in their circumstances.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",45
"46","15523. You know that from dealing with them?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",46
"47","—Yes.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",47
"48","15524. Do you know that the produce of the crofts is falling off from overcrowding and otherwise ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",48
"49","—I consider that on my own croft.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",49
"50","15525. And I suppose you give your croft fuU justice in the way of manure ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",50
"51","—Yes, so far as I can.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",51
"52","15526. You can tell us something about the fish traffic in this neighbourhood. Do you think that the new quay here will be of great value to the place ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",52
"53","—Well, I expect so.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",53

"57","—Yes.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",57
"58","15529. But there is no reason, if there was a landing place, why they should not come here ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",58
"59","—If there was a safe landing place for boats they would come here.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",59
"60","15530. How far out does the fishing extend?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",60
"61","—I cannot say, but they are going out of sight from here.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",61
"62","15531. Are you a native of the place?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",62

"66","15533. But everybody complains?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",66

"72","15536. Have you a share in the boat yourself?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",72
"73","—No, I have not a share in a boat. I am keeping the boats for the fishermen at so much for the season.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",73
"74","15537. What do you give to the fishermen who are employed for the season ? Do you give them any wages except the shilling for the ling ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",74
"75","—Nothing.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",75
"76","15538. Do you provide the boat and everything else?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",76
"77","—Yes, I provide the boat.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",77
"78","15539. And the nets?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",78

"95","—Of course.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",95
"96","15548. I suppose, in the same way, when you buy in the south, you think you will be paying too much to the wholesale men ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",96
"97","—Yes.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",97
"98","15549. You have told us that the only way to put the people right in your opinion is to give them more land, Is there anything else you think would benefit the people here ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",98
"99","—I am thinking that they would require to get a remedy by the sea—to assist them with boats and nets to carry on the herring fishing, as the ling fishing now is a great failure.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",99
"100","15550. You think that by getting assistance in the way of superior boats and nets the herring fishing could be carried on to a great advantage ?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",100
"101","—They are thinking so.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",101
"102","15551. Would the proposed harbour works here be sufficient in the meantime to accommodate a considerable number of herring boats?",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",102
"103","—We are thinking it would keep 100 boats or so—may be more.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",103

"119","—No, I don't think so.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",119

"151","—No.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",151

"153","—I think they would be able to learn better if they were taught in Gaelic.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",153

"187","—I dont mind that.",281,"Finlay Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",187
