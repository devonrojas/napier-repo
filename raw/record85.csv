"4","—Yes. .",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",4
"5","4762. You have produced a paper. Is that the statement which you wish to put into our hands?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",5
"6","—Yes. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",6
"7","4763. Has this been seen by all the persons who sent you here ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",7
"8","—Yes. It is as follows :",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",8
"9","—' Lower Breakish, May 14, 1883. The township of Lower Breakish was originally let to tenants in the year 1800, and formed into forty lots, with equal shares of pastures from the shore to the watershed as wind and rain might divide it. We possessed these lots for a number of years, until Mr Macpherson, then factor, deprived us of one of our pastures without any summons or reduction of rent, and let it to tenants which still hold it. We had still a right to keep sheep or cattle on the hill pastures until Tormore, the late factor, deprived us of all the hill, and ordered our sheep to be gathered to Kinloch sheepfold, where we had either to kill them at once, or seH them for half price. He left us a patch of the hill for a shift for our cattle twice a year. This place is four miles distant from the nearest of us; and our wives or daughters have to travel that distance twice a day, viz., 16 miles, for very little milk, and four men have to watch the cattle night and day during the whole time. In the second year of his factorship he (Tormore) added to our rent from 3s. to 16s. per lot. Moreover, he charged the township £20 extra for the patch of hill pasture. Seventeen of the lots are divided into two halves, in allsixty-three families, with a population of 311. We will be in poverty and want, and a burden to the community until the other township., Upper Breakish, is lifted, and the place restored to us as before.",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",9
"10","4764. Do you desire to add anything to that statement on your own part ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",10
"11","—Yes. I desire to tell that when our forefathers got the land some of them went to the army, and others had sons and brothers in the army, when the last Macdonald regiment was raised, and that was the reason why these crofters got this township cut out. The township was previously in possession of eight crofters. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",11
"12","4765. Do you mean that the township of Upper Breakish was cut out of the township of Breakish or Lower Breakish ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",12
"13","—Yes. Upper Breakish was cut out of the pasture belonging to Lower Breakish. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",13
"14","4766. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",14
"15","—When did you get Lower Breakish ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",15
"16","— In 1803. There were eight tenants thare previously, and the descendants of these eight are with us yet. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",16
"17","4767. The Chairman.",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",17
"18","—I understand that before the year 1800 there were in Lower Breakish eight tenants ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",18
"19","—Yes. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",19
"20","4768. And that subsequent to that date tenants were brought in and located on the same land ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",20
"21","—On their pasture. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",21
"22","4769. As a reward to them because their relatives took service in Lord Macdonald's regiment ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",22
"23","—Yes. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",23
"24","4770. How many families were there then settled upon it ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",24
"25","—Forty. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",25
"26","4771. Forty new ones, or forty including the eight?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",26
"27","—Forty in addition to the original eight ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",27
"28","4772. What next ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",28
"29","—The second grazing which they got has since been taken from them. The whole pasture which we had for our sheep has been taken from us. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",29
"30","4773. How much hill pasture have you now got remaining ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",30
"31","—A strip about two miles in length, and I cannot say it is half a mile in breadth. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",31
"32","4774. Do they keep any sheep?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",32
"33","—No, neither sheep nor horse. If a man keeps a horse, he must buy grazing for it from somebody else outside our township. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",33
"34","4775. How far is this, the strip of grazing, from the holdings on the township ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",34
"35","—Four miles from those of us who are nearest to it. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",35
"36","4776. Is it true that the people really go, at a certain season, four miles back and forward, twice a day, to this place ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",36
"37","—Yes, doubtless. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",37
"38","4777. How many do that ? How many is if necessary to employ ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",38
"39","— Every one who has a cow has to do that. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",39
"40","4778. Have they brought this hardship under the notice of the factor and the landlord 1",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",40
"41","—Yes, doubtless. It was Tormore who did this upon us, and we applied three times to our present factor to have this hardship removed, and he has uot done so. He is trying to do so. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",41
"42","4779. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",42
"43","—How long is it since Upper Breakish was cut off Lower Breakish ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",43
"44","—About seventy years ago. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",44
"45","4780. How long is it since the next piece of pasture was taken from them by Tormore ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",45
"46","—About five years ago. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",46
"47","4781. Who got it?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",47
"48","—The people of Upper Breakish. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",48
"49","4782. When Upper Breakish got that pasture, was no pasture left in Lower Breakish?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",49
"50","—Yes, a piece is left them yet. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",50
"51","4783. This other piece that was given them four miles away is charged £20 of rent ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",51
"52","—Yes, and even it is part of the old grazing that we had. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",52
"53","4784. It is not mentioned in this paper as part of the old grazing ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",53
"54","— That does not matter. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",54
"55","4785. Then they had to pay £20 extra for a piece of their own hill ground ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",55
"56","—Yes. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",56
"57","4786. Why did Tormore raise the rent ? Was it because he had the place valued ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",57
"58","—I am not aware, unless he valued it himself. He never came to see where we were living, or what sort of land we had, and yet he raised our rents twice. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",58
"59","4787. Are their rents dearer than those of their neighbours, comparing their land and stock",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",59
"60","—I mean the rents in Lower Breakish compared with those along the coast here ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",60
"61","—They may be equally dear in other townships. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",61
"62","4788. Were they cheap rented before the £20 was put on ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",62
"63","—It was not. We were not counting it cheap at all. Our opinion is, there is not a township in Skye so dear as ours. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",63
"64","4789. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",64
"65","—When this bit of land five years ago was given to the Upper Breakish people, did the Upper Breakish people pay any rent for that?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",65
"66","—Yes, a little over £40. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",66
"67","4790. What reduction did you get for its being taken away from you ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",67
"68","— Not a halfpenny, but £20 additional was laid upon us. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",68
"69","4791. Do I understand that five years ago, when this piece of land was taken from Lower Breakish and given to Upper Breakish, £40 of rent was paid by the people of Upper Breakish; whereas you yourselves received no reduction of rent for this bit being taken away ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",69
"70","—No, we did not get a halfpenny, but our rents were raised £20 for the piece which was left with us. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",70
"71","4792. But as I understand, you had not that piece for which you are now paying £20 at the time the detached piece of Upper Breakish was taken away ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",71
"72","—Yes, we had it, except a small corner. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",72
"73","4793. Then we come to this, that except that small corner, there was at your expense a rise of £40 of rent got for a piece of land, and you yourselves paid £20 also. It came to a matter of £60 ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",73
"74","—Yes. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",74
"75","4794. Was there any reason given for that operation ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",75
"76","—No reason given. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",76
"77","4795. Did I understand you rightly to say that the factor never went to these places to see what was proposed to be done at this time ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",77
"78","—The factor went to see the hill pasture, but he never came to see us or our houses. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",78
"79","4796. What period of notice did you get that this was to be done?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",79
"80","— We did get notice beforehand. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",80
"81","4797. How long ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",81
"82","—I cannot remember, but the time was not long. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",82
"83","4798. Were you warned out of it ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",83
"84","—No. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",84
"85","4799. Did you protest and object at the time ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",85
"86","—Yes, we were objecting of the pasture being taken from us altogether, but we were not objecting to the half being given to our neighbours. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",86
"87","4800. Did the Upper Breakish people get anything else except this bit of hill pasture for the £40 ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",87
"88","—They got a little piece of the Kyle tack, but we claimed what they got as ours by right. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",88
"89","4801. You say in your petition that you will be in poverty and want and a burden to the community until the other township of Upper Breakish is lifted. Where do you propose to put the people of Upper Breakish ? ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",89
"90","—Is there not plenty of land through the country  ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",90
"91","The gentlemen can easily understand that we cannot but be in poverty in a place where there are sixty-three families and three hundred and eleven souls altogether, and when we have only about 160 acres of arable land, and part of it rocky and mossy,—covering the rocks with earth which I had to carry on my back in creels, carrying stones in the same way with creels to the drains. We have neither horse nor cart. I have only one sheep, and she had three lambs last year, and I have no place to keep them on. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",91
"92","4802. The Chairman.",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",92
"93","—Are we to understand that the women of your township have to walk sixteen nines a day for the purpose of milking their cows twice a day?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",93
"94","—Yes, doubtless. If there are two women in a family, the one takes it at the one end of the day, and the other at the other. If they don't do that, the calves will perish in our folds. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",94
"95","4803. You stated that the factor held out the hope to you that your grievance would be redressed. Do you have ground for thinking that your grievance will soon be remedied 1",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",95
"96","—We are in that hope. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",96
"97","4804. How does the factor intend to remedy the grievance ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",97
"98","—He was promising that we would get a part of the hill pasture back. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",98
"99","4805. From Upper Breakish?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",99
"100","—Yes. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",100
"101","4806. How would he indemnify the people of Upper Breakish for the loss of their pasture 1",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",101
"102","—I do not know. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",102
"103","4807. Do you know of any steps taken by the factor to remove the grievance?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",103
"104","—I know that he came twice or thrice to us, but we could not agree among ourselves about it. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",104
"105","4808. What sort of land is it that intervenes between the crofts and the sheepfold of Kinloch ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",105
"106","—Black heathery hill pasture. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",106
"107","4809. Whose occupation is it in ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",107
"108","—Part of it we have ourselves, and the people of Upper Breakish have the rest The part which is next to their lots belongs to them, and we have to walk over that before we reach our own. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",108
"109","4810. I suppose that from your experience you are of the opinion that it is very important for hill pasture, which is attached to crofts, to be in the immediate vicinit}' of the arable ground ?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",109
"110","—Yes. ",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",110
"111","4811. And that an arrangement for giving hill pasture to crofters who do not possess it would not be beneficial to them unless such hill pasture were situated close to the arable ground?",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",111
"112","—Yes.",85,"Donald Mcgillvray","Skye, Broadford",112
