"1","ADAM MACKAY, Crofter, Bardarroch, Strathkyle (60)—examined.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",1
"2","39818. The Chairman.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",2
"3","—What is the name of your proprietor?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",3
"4","—Mr Mackay. G. G. Mackay.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",4
"5","39819. Mr Cameron.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",5
"6","—How many crofters are on this property of Strathkyle?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",6
"7","—Seventeen.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",7
"8","39820. Are you a delegate from them?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",8
"9","—Yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",9
"10","39821. What are their average rents?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",10
"11","—From £30 down to £10.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",11
"12","39822. What is your own rent?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",12
"13","—£30.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",13
"14","39823. What amount of land do you hold?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",14
"15","—-About eight acres of arable land and twenty-three of meadow.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",15
"16","39824. Any common pasture amongst the tenants?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",16
"17","—No.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",17
"18","39825. Each tenant is, so to speak, self-contained. He grazes his own beasts on his own land, summer and winter?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",18
"19","—Yes. The hill pasture was all taken from them as soon as the old lease expired.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",19
"20","39826. Now, how do those of the tenants who pay £ 10 work their land; do they work it on a five-shift rotation?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",20
"21","—Well, they do something like that.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",21
"22","39827. Do they leave one field out two years in permanent pasture?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",22
"23","—Yes, they require to do that for their cows, when there is no hill pasture.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",23
"24","39828. Is each croft fenced off from its neighbour?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",24
"25","—Yes, not by a wire fence, but by a stone fence.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",25
"26","39829. Don't you consider a stone dyke superior to wire?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",26
"27","—Yes, if it is put up right.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",27
"28","39830. I suppose you mean the stones are apt to tumble down?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",28
"29","—Yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",29
"30","39831. But it is not a very serious matter for a tenant to put up the stones when they tumble down?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",30
"31","—They put up the stones they take off their fields as a protection between man and man.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",31
"32","39832. These are not built dykes?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",32
"33","—No. There are some put up by the proprietor, and some that the crofters themselves put up.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",33
"34","39833. And which are put up in the best way?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",34
"35","—The proprietor's.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",35
"36","39834. Are those put up by the crofters not sufficient to keep their neighbours' cattle from trespassing on their arable ground?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",36
"37","—No.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",37
"38","39835. Are there any stones on the ground for the crofters to make the fence sufficient if they chose to expend a little money on it?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",38
"39","—No, they have not time to do it. The land is so dear that they cannot get them to do that.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",39
"40","39836. Do the crofters consider themselves too highly rented?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",40
"41","—Yes, mostly double what they ought to be.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",41
"42","39837. Is your holding now an average specimen of the crofters' as to rent, looking to the size? Is  yours a fair example of the rest?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",42
"43","—They are just about the same thing.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",43
"44","39838. You say you have eight acres arable ground?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",44
"45","—Eight and a half.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",45
"46","39839. And twenty-three of meadow pasture?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",46
"47","—Yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",47
"48","39840. What do you consider the meadow pasture to be worth an acre?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",48
"49","—It is charged at 10s. an acre by the proprietor.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",49
"50","39841. Do you consider that too much? ",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",50
"51","—Yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",51
"52","39842. What do you do with the meadow pasture? Do you pasture it all, or take crops of hay alternately?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",52
"53","—We take crops of hay, and we take crops of corn sometimes, but the Kyle of Sutherland comes over it and destroys the corn.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",53
"54","39843. It is more suitable for pasture or hay?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",54
"55","—Yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",55
"56","39844. Do you take hay off it the whole of the year, or do you take hay off it alternate years?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",56
"57","—We take hay off it yearly.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",57
"58","39845. And what number of stones or tons do you get to the acre? Have you ever made any calculation?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",58
"59","—About fifty or sixty stones of natural hay.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",59
"60","39846. And after that you get the pasture for the cattle during the winter?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",60
"61","—It is no use for the cattle, because very often the water goes over it in winter, and spoils it.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",61
"62","39847. So all you get is the hay off it?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",62
"63","—Most of it; and it grazes cattle in summer.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",63
"64","39848. After the hay is taken away?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",64
"65","—No, there is hardly any grass growing on it after the hay is taken off.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",65
"66","39849. Do you graze your cattle upon it before your hay is taken off?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",66
"67","—No.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",67
"68","39850. Then you get the hay off, and for the rest of the summer you graze your cattle upon it?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",68
"69","—Yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",69
"70","39851. So you get fifty or sixty stones of hay per acre off it, and you get the after-grass for the cattle until the floods come and render it unfit for that purpose?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",70
"71","—Yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",71
"72","39852. Do you consider 10s an acre too high for land that can be treated in that way?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",72
"73","—Yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",73
"74","39853. What would you put it at?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",74
"75","—At 5s.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",75
"76","39854. Then is the eight and a half acres of arable good land?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",76
"77","—Yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",77
"78","39855. What is it calculated at per acre?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",78
"79","—More than £1.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",79
"80","39856. Do you consider that too high?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",80
"81","—Well, it is too high by a long way, the rest of the acres are so bad with the flood.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",81
"82","39857. But the arable acres are not covered by the floods?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",82
"83","—No.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",83
"84","39858. Then do you consider £1 per acre for the eight and a half acres is still too high without reference to the other?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",84
"85","—I think that £1 would do if the rest were good.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",85
"86","39859. In point of fact, you would not complain of the eight and a half acres if the meadow were reduced?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",86
"87","—If the meadow were not flooded, I would not complain of it at all.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",87
"88","39860. Would it pay to erect any protection against the floods?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",88
"89","—No.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",89
"90","39861. Is that the principal complaint of the tenants you represent?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",90
"91","—The principal complaint is that their hill pasture was taken from them, and instead of taking down their rents, their rents were put up higher. It was all planted.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",91
"92","39862. What year was that in?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",92
"93","—About 1873.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",93
"94","39863. Who bought the property then?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",94
"95","—Mr G. G. Mackay bought it from the late laird of Novar in 1870. The tenants had a lease up to 1873.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",95
"96","39864. And when their leases expired?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",96
"97","—He deprived them of their pasture, and planted it",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",97
"98","39865. Was any valuation of the land made—the lands that remained with the tenants at that time?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",98
"99","—I think there was.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",99
"100","39866. What was the result of it?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",100
"101","—That they had to pay a higher rent.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",101
"102","39867. What was your croft rented at before?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",102
"103","—£20, with the hill pasture.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",103
"104","39868. And in 1873 it was raised to £ 30?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",104
"105","—Yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",105
"106","39869. And the others in proportion?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",106
"107","—Yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",107
"108","39870. Did Mr Mackay value it himself?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",108
"109","—He valued it himself.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",109
"110","39871. Had he any meetings with his tenants to satisfy them that he was putting a fair increase upon them, or did he just give notice that it was to be raised?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",110
"111","—He told them at once that it was to be raised.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",111
"112","39872. Did he not take them into his confidence, or explain how it was too low before, and why it was to be raised?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",112
"113","—Well, I didn't hear. I have come to the estate since then.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",113
"114","39873. Did your predecessor pay £ 30?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",114
"115","—Yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",115
"116","39874. Then you must have been satisfied yourself that the place was worth £30, or you would not have taken it?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",116
"117","—But when Mr G. G. Mackay bought the estate he sold part of it to Mr Hadwen. I was a tenant there, and Mr Hadwen deprived the tenants of the hill, and I was evicted, and I was two years without a place at all.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",117
"118","39875. Was this place close to the place you have now?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",118
"119","—Yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",119
"120","39876. You must have known all about it?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",120
"121","—Well, I didn't know. It was put into lots, and I thought the place was better than it is.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",121
"122","39877. But still you would know more than if you had been a complete stranger?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",122
"123","—Yes, but I thought it was better than being in the poorhouse.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",123
"124","39878. Any how you took it with your eyes open. Don't you think the other tenants had, perhaps, more reason to complain than you had?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",124
"125","—They are as bad.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",125
"126","39879. They had no choice given them at all?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",126
"127","—No choice at all.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",127
"128","39880. Have you any other remarks to make about the estate or the management of it?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",128
"129","—No.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",129
"130","39881. The Chairman.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",130
"131","—Is it not usual on these larger crofts from £ 10 to £30, to have fences between the crofts or between the fields?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",131
"132","—The proprietor put some stone dykes between some of the lots, but not between the whole of them.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",132
"133","39882. If the proprietor would put up substantial fences between the different lots, or between the different fields, would the tenants co-operate with him and take part of the labour or expense, or do they not consider fences as of any importance?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",133
"134","—For these stone dykes they had to gather the stones themselves. The proprietor would only be at the expense of building them.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",134
"135","39883. Would the tenants be willing to take the trouble of gathering the stones if the proprietor would build them?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",135
"136","—Yes, they would.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",136
"137","39884. And they would consider that was an advantage to the croft?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",137
"138","—Yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",138
"139","39885. You said it would be of no use, and that you could not fence your meadow land against inundation; where does the water come from?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",139
"140","—From the river.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",140
"141","39886. Is there no dyke along the river side at all?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",141
"142","—No.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",142
"143","39887. No turf dyke?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",143
"144","—No.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",144
"145","39888. Do they never in this country build river fences to prevent the river overflowing?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",145
"146","—In a little part, but it was of no use. The water broke through.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",146
"147","39889. Perhaps it was not strong enough?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",147
"148","—Oh I yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",148
"149","39890. Would it not be possible to make a proper dyke?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",149
"150","—I don't think so; it would not pay.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",150
"151","39891. Does not the proprietor help in this country to make river dykes?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",151
"152","—I am not sure.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",152
"153","39892. Does this meadow lie pretty well above the common level of the water, or is it quite low down?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",153
"154","—Quite low down.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",154
"155","39893. Have you a lease now?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",155
"156","—Yes.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",156
"157","39894. How many years?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",157
"158","—Nineteen years.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",158
"159","39895. How many years have you still to run?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",159
"160","—Fifteen.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",160
"161","39896. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",161
"162","—Are there any feuars on Culrain estate?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",162
"163","—There is one.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",163
"164","39897. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",164
"165","—Is there anybody else from the estate with you to-day?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",165
"166","—Yes, George Ross and David Rose.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",166
"167","39898. You mentioned you were evicted from Mr Hadwen’s estate; is it you who has a great grievance against Mr Hadwen?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",167
"168","—The only thing is that he evicted me away from the place where I was born.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",168
"169","39899. What is the name of the place?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",169
"170","—Rielonie.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",170
"171","39900. Is there a man commonly called the Bard?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",171
"172","—Yes; he is here.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",172
"173","39901. You are not the Bard?",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",173
"174","—No, his name is Alexander Ross, Achnahannet.",662,"Adam Mackay","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",174
