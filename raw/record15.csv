"2","970. The Chairman.",15,"Angus Macfie","Skye, Skeabost",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected a delegate by the people in this place ?",15,"Angus Macfie","Skye, Skeabost",3
"4","—Yes.",15,"Angus Macfie","Skye, Skeabost",4
"5","971. How long have you been settled here?",15,"Angus Macfie","Skye, Skeabost",5
"6","—For fifty years.",15,"Angus Macfie","Skye, Skeabost",6
"7","972. Has your employment been chiefly that of a crofter, or a fisherman, or a trader?",15,"Angus Macfie","Skye, Skeabost",7
"8","—Fishing the most part of the year, and in the spring time doing the work of the croft",15,"Angus Macfie","Skye, Skeabost",8

"13","975. Do you agree generally with what has been stated ?",15,"Angus Macfie","Skye, Skeabost",13
"14","—For the most part it was applicable to the circumstances of the people.",15,"Angus Macfie","Skye, Skeabost",14
"15","976. Do you desire to add anything on your own part?",15,"Angus Macfie","Skye, Skeabost",15
"16","—Only in regard to the circumstances of the people among whom I am. The smallness of their holdings is the cause of their poverty, and the want of pasturage. My place was originally occupied by sixteen crofters, and a few year3 afterwards these were increased by eighteen more, who were located on the grazing which belonged to the township. Of the sixteen original holders, only three were paying above £2 of rent; on the thirty-four who subsequently occupied it the rent was increased to an average of £3 each. This was done by the landlord who succeeded him in whose time it was occupied by sixteen crofters; he was Mr Macdonald of Tannara. The trustees succeeded him, from whom the tenants got some reduction of rent. Mr M'Leod of Grishornish succeeded the trustees, and in his time 5s. of rise was made in the rent in lieu of five days' duty work. This continued to the present year, and they were relieved of this sum by the present proprietor, and a further decrease was made in our rent also on our part of the property. The people are so poor from want of room for themselves and for their stock, and they have to go in thesummer time with their stock—with their cows—they have to lead those cows with a rope between the corn rigs to keep them in life for want of outside pasturage. Instead of pasturage they have only the peat mosses. Of the corn crop which they grow they have to devote a third part to the feeding of their cows. They have a cow on each lot and a stirk, and they must part with the stirk whenever it can walk to the market. Besides, whatever crop they have to use in feeding their stock, they have to buy fodder. There is no reason for me to occupy more time saying what has been said already. What the people desire is that they should get more land and hill pasturage, that they might be able to keep a stock that would support them.",15,"Angus Macfie","Skye, Skeabost",16
