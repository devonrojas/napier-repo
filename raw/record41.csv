"32","—There are many of them who, through poverty, have no sheep. [Question repeated].",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",32
"33","—The end of the district, where I reside, has not been deprived of hill pasture. I am not able to answer for this part.

",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",33
"34","2536. Did the people use the wool of their own sheep largely for making blankets, or were they in the habit of selling it ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",34

"57","—Yes. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",57
"58","2547. When did that commence ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",58
"59","—About fifteen or twenty years ago, and it is one of the causes to which the poverty of the people is to be ascribed. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",59
"60","2548. Why do they resort to bills?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",60
"61","—The landlord rules them so strictly that payment in full must needs be proffered at the rent day. If only part of it were offered it would not be taken. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",61
"62","2549. Was that the universal practice on this estate, so far as you know ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",62

"64","2550. In that way there wore no arrears?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",64
"65","—No, not at that time, until the present years—until the people were not able to pay. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",65
"66","2551. Have they not been able to pay even with bills?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",66
"67","—Yes; some of the parties who used to give their securities on these bills have not been paid. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",67
"68","2552. If there was no money to pay the bill, of course the cattle had to be sold ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",68
"69","—Yes ; but some securities were so favourable to them that they did not push them so far. There were some people getting money out of banks here who had not a head of stock. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",69
"70","2553. Have you many bad debts yourself ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",70
"71","—Plenty. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",71
"72","2554. Do you think, from what you know of the people of the district in which you dwell, that they are mostly in debt ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",72
"73","—Yes. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",73
"74","2555. Do you think it is because they are very lazy?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",74
"75","—I do not think that. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",75
"76","2556. Is there no work given them here?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",76
"77","—I am not aware of any but fishing. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",77
"78","2557. Does the proprietor give them any work to do?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",78
"79","—Only to a few. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",79
"80","2558. Does he come often to see them?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",80
"81","—We never see him. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",81
"82","2559. Does he never come here?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",82
"83","—We have seen him occasionally, down the way, but we were not seeing him often. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",83
"84","2560. Has he ever visited the houses of any of the people in this district ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",84
"85","—I am not aware that he did. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",85
"86","2561. Does the factor come often?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",86
"87","—At the rent collection. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",87
"88","2562. Does he come at any other time?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",88
"89","—He comes to school board meetings. He is a member of the school board and parochial board, and comes to attend these meetings. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",89
"90","2563. The last witness told us that a boll of meal could not be got without a particular beast being set aside as security for it. Do they put a mark upon the beast ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",90
"91","—The beast will be marked when it is bought. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",91
"92","2564. Do you do that yourself?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",92
"93","—Yes; in a few instances. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",93
"94","2565. Is it left for some time with the man who gets the boll of meal ? ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",94
"95","—Yes. I pay the man for the wintering of the beast in addition to the price of it. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",95
"96","2566. The Chairman",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",96
"97","—Is that particular beast security for that particular debt ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",97
"98","—Yes; that is the purpose for which it is bought. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",98
"99","2567. If the man pays for the boll of meal a month or two afterwards will he get his beast back ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",99
"100","—It is not for the boll of meal that the beast is security, but for the value of the beast in meal. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",100
"101","2568. Would you rather have the beast, or rather have the money ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",101
"102","—I would prefer the money. I would not wish a beast from any man who had got the money. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",102
"103","2569. If you don't get the money, how soon do you take possession of the beast, and sell him ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",103
"104","—To the last market of the year—the September market. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",104
"105","2570. If the beast dies, is it your loss or the loss of the crofter ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",105
"106","—-It is my loss, when I mark it. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",106
"107","2571. If the beast fetches more money than the amount of the debt, who has the balance?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",107
"108","—I only want my debt out of it. If the man gets any body to give more than I give for it, I give up the beast. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",108
"109","2572. The man is allowed to sell it, in fact?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",109
"110","—It is I who must deliver the beast to its new purchaser, and the money must pass to me, for fear of its being lost to me. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",110
"111","2573. If the beast dies, does the debt remain cancelled?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",111
"112","—No; it is to relieve the people, and for the people's convenience that I enter into such transactions, as they will not get relief anywhere else.",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",112
"113","2574. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",113
"114","—How many crofters and others do you represent as delegate in the township you come from ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",114
"115","—Eleven who pay rent. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",115
"116","2575 You have been present, and heard the preceding witness. Have they any grievance of hill pasture having been taken away or their rent raised ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",116
"117","—They have complained about the piece of hill pasture that was taken away from them. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",117
"118","2576. Are you a crofter yourself 1",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",118
"119","—I am a crofter myself. I am one of the eleven. It is from this end of the township that the hill pasture was taken, and our sheep are consequently crowded together on the remainder. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",119
"120","2577. When was this hill pasture taken from you?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",120
"121","—Sixteen years ago. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",121
"122","2578. Why was it taken off, and to whom was it given]",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",122
"123","—I am not aware why it was taken from us. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",123
"124","2579. Who got it ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",124
"125","—It was added to the Duntulm tack. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",125
"126","2580. Was any reduction of rent given to you at that time ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",126
"127","—Our rent was not reduced, unless it was reduced in the case of the parties from whom the hill was taken. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",127
"128","2581. What is the name of the townships at the end where the hill pasture was taken away ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",128
"129","—Deig, Glasfin, and Brogaig. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",129
"130","2582. Then these three townships and the township you represent had the whole in common ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",130
"131","—Yes. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",131
"132","2583. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",132
"133","—But more townships than these had a share in the hill ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",133
"134","—No. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",134
"135","2584. Is there any division between the hill of the different townships all along the east side here ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",135
"136","—No, it is common hill pasture. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",136
"137","2585. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",137
"138","—Have the rents been increased in your time ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",138
"139","—Yes. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",139
"140","2586. What was it in your younger days?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",140
"141","—According to the old people with whom I have been speaking, at one time my township was in the possession of one crofter. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",141
"142","2587. What was he paying1?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",142
"143","—I do not know what he was paying, but afterwards the township was divided between eight crofters, paying £50. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",143
"144","2588. What is it paying now for the whole ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",144
"145","—£87, 5s. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",145
"146","2589. Is that after the abatement that was given 1",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",146
"147","—That is the highest without the abatement. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",147
"148","2590. What has been taken off in the way of abatement lately ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",148
"149","—5s. in the pound. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",149
"150","2591. Professor Mackinnon.",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",150
"151","—Do you belong to this country?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",151
"152","—Yes. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",152
"153","2592. To the particular township in which you are just now ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",153
"154","—I am a native of that township. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",154
"155","2593. And you have lived there all your life ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",155
"156","—Yes. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",156
"157","2594. And you know the condition of the people thoroughly well for the last forty years?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",157
"158","—Yes, I believe there is no one who knows it better. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",158
"159","2595. And your opinion is that they are getting poorer and poorer every year?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",159
"160","—Yes, I kuow that by experience. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",160
"161","2596. And to what do you attribute this ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",161
"162","—There are several causes. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",162
"163","2597. What are these?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",163
"164","—Buying the meal is very heavy on them; the rent is high; raising money out of banks; the inconvenience of the place for bringing things into it. They cannot get things to buy as cheap as they can get them in other places more accessible. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",164
"165","2598. And their indebtedness to yourself is growing every year?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",165
"166","—Yes. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",166
"167","2599. How can you stand it all?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",167
"168","—I have stood it yet. Nobody has lost by me yet. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",168
"169","2600. About the pledging of cattle for the meal, do you consider the beast yours when once it is marked Ì",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",169
"170","—Yes, I consider the beast mine, and if the beast gets lost it is my loss. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",170
"171","2601. Do you put a price upon it when you mark it?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",171
"172","—Yes. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",172
"173","2602. And do you tell the price to the owner ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",173
"174","—Yes. We make an agreement about the price first. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",174
"175","2603. And the price of the meal too ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",175
"176","—Not the price of the meal, because there is no knowing what the price may be during the year: the man does not take with him at one time the value of the beast",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",176
"177","2604. So the beast is pledged in reality before he gets the meal ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",177
"178","—Yes, in the case of some. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",178
"179","2605. And what security is there that the man will get the meal ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",179
"180","—He is not the least afraid that he will not get the meal. In the cases in which I mark beasts as security, the party is already far in my debt. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",180
"181","2606. And does the beast go to cancel that debt ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",181
"182","—No, but for present and future relief. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",182
"183","2607. And if the price of the beast at the next market, when sold by yourself, is more than tbe price you told the man, and the price of its keep meanwhile, does the man get the balance ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",183
"184","—I will put it to his credit. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",184
"185","2608. You say the price of goods here is very much greater because of the difficulty of getting goods into the country. What is the price of a pound of tea ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",185
"186","—Three shillings for good tea. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",186
"187","2609. What is the price of it at Portree ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",187
"188","—I do not know. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",188
"189","2610. Do you sell a quantity of teal",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",189
"190","—Yes. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",190
"191","2611. Is the quantity of tea which you sell increasing every year?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",191
"192","— Not this year. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",192
"193","2612. But without reference to this year, which is exceptional, has it very much increased since you began to trade sixteen years ago ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",193
"194","— Yes. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",194
"195","2613. Sheriff Nicolson.",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",195
"196","—I suppose you don't sell whisky?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",196
"197","—No, I never dealt in it. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",197
"198","2614. Is there much whisky consumed in the district?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",198
"199","—I do not know what the consumption may be, but there are some here who may tell about that. I have a further complaint to make. I have to complain of the way our marches are open between ourselves and the neighbouring tacksman. We have applied to the landlord to put a fence between us and the neighbouring proprietor. We did not get a reply from him. We had two herds during the past year. We do not expect to be able to have a herd at all this year, because some of the people have become so poor that they are not able to pay their share of the herd. We do not know what to do with our stock. We cannot keep them from trespassing on Scorrybreck without this fence. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",199
"200","2615. The Chairman.",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",200
"201","—If the proprietor would pay for a proportion of the fence, would the crofters assist in paying some proportion of it ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",201
"202","— Yes; we would pay a part. We told him we would agree with any terms he would lay upon us. ",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",202
"203","2616. Would you carry the materials up, and assist in setting up the fence ?",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",203
"204","—Some of us would do that, but those who cannot pay even a herd would find some difficulty in doing anything. We have no road or post-office. Our township, again, is in two halves—half up towards the hill. We keep our cows there. We cannot use the manure from there for the use of our arable ground. We have no road from the shore to our arable ground. We have to carry the sea-weed on our backs and with horses, and we pay road rates without grumbling. We applied for the piece of road to Loanfern to be repaired",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",204
"205","—the road that was laid out by the destitution committee before",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",205
"206","—and it was at that time suitable for conveyances.",41,"Donald Ross","Skye, Stenscholl",206
