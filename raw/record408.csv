"1","PETER SMITH, Garth (52)—examined.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",1
"2","23800. The Chairman.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",2
"3","—Has your family been long settled here ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",3
"4","—Yes.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",4
"5","23801. How long has it been settled here—how old is your family in its present property?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",5
"6","—My father lived on the farm which I occupy during his lifetime, and the farm belonged to my predecessors for I cannot tell you how long. They have always lived in this place.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",6
"7","23802. When you speak of occupying, you mean possessing?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",7
"8","—Exactly.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",8
"9","23803. Your family have always possessed the land in this place?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",9
"10","—I cannot tell you how long ago exactly the farm was purchased, but it has been in the possession of my predecessors for upwards of 100 years.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",10
"11","23804. Do you think there are many of the small proprietors here who have possessed their lands for 300 or 100 years. Have you heard that stated?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",11
"12","—I am not aware of having heard that stated.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",12
"13","23805. Have you ever seen any ancient titles—any ancient parchments or deeds—in their possession?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",13
"14","—No.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",14
"15","23806. What is the size of your property—how many acres is it?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",15
"16","— About thirty-six acres arable. ",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",16
"17","23807. And how much of pasture?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",17
"18","—Of infield there is about four or five acres, exclusive of a lot of commonty outside, of twenty-six acres.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",18
"19","23808. Besides the arable portion you have commonty?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",19
"20","—Exactly.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",20
"21","23809. Is that commonty divided among the proprietors? ",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",21
"22","— The commonty of Harray was divided probably twenty years ago. I was not in the country then.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",22
"23","23810. But now it is divided?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",23
"24","—Yes.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",24
"25","23811. And are the different portions of the commonty fenced from each other with wire fences?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",25
"26","—None at all, so far as I am aware.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",26
"27","23812. They are divided merely by marks—by indications?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",27
"28","—Some of the proprietors have run ditches, but not in general.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",28
"29","23813. How do they prevent their stock from mixing with each other? do they tether them?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",29
"30","—There are very few stock in the pasture on the commonty; the stock is kept principally now on the farm; the commonty is not used as much as it used to be by cattle pasturing on it.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",30
"31","23814. Do they make no use of the commonty except to cut peats?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",31
"32","—They put cattle on it occasionally, but not generally.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",32
"33","23815. When they put cattle on it, do they tether them?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",33
"34","—No.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",34
"35","23816. Is the commonty very wild ground — heathery?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",35
"36","—There is some of it bad ground that is not fit for cultivation in its present state; other parts, again, are in a state that it can be cultivated, but still it is very poor.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",36
"37","23817. Is it a common thing for the proprietors to enlarge their arable land by taking in a portion of the commonty?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",37
"38","—Yes; it is occasionally done when the commonty is contiguous to the farm.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",38
"39","23818. Have you yourself taken in any part of your commonty?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",39
"40","—About five acres.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",40
"41","23819. And have you found that that was remunerative—that it was just as good as arable?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",41
"42","—No, far from that. When we bring it into cultivation we let it lie for a number of years, and in that time it will probably be beginning to grow heathery again, and then we break it up and sow it down with grass for a number of years. In fact it does not pay us to cultivate it in arable rotation, it is so poor.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",42
"43","23820. How do you manage about your small estates after your death? Are they divided or are they always left to one member of the family ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",43
"44","—I do not know exactly; but I suppose the general way is that the property goes to the one individual —the landed property.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",44
"45","23821. Is it the practice of small proprietors generally to devise their property by will; or do they just leave it to the course of the law of the country?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",45
"46","—I think the practice varies considerably in that case; there is no general practice so far as I am aware.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",46
"47","23822. But I understand you to say that it is not the practice to divide the land between the sons?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",47
"48","—No; not that I am aware of.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",48
"49","23823. Since you remember, has there been any subdivision of these little estates; or do they remain just as they were in the old times?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",49
"50","—There has been no subdivision so far as I am aware, of any consequence. ",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",50
"51","23824. In the case of the large farmers, what becomes of the younger sons?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",51
"52","—They find employment elsewhere; a great many of them go to the colonies. Not many of the younger sons remain at home at all.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",52
"53","23825. Are these small properties generally heavily mortgaged, or are they pretty free of debt?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",53
"54","—I could not speak positively upon that point, but I don't think there is much debt.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",54
"55","23826. You don't hear that complained of ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",55
"56","—No.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",56
"57","23827. And in your recollection has there been a great improvement in the appearance of the properties and the method of cultivation?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",57
"58","—Yes, a very decided improvement.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",58
"59","23828. Do you frequently put up stone walls—fences?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",59
"60","—We put up fences occasionally, and some proprietors have used them pretty extensively to enclose almost the whole of their properties.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",60
"61","23829. And is that going on at the present time?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",61
"62","—Always a little.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",62
"63","23830. Is the breed of cattle improving?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",63
"64","—I expect it is.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",64
"65","23831. What breeds do you use generally?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",65
"66","—Shorthorn as pure as we can.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",66
"67","23832. Your land is all ploughed, not worked with the spade?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",67
"68","—It is all ploughed.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",68
"69","23833. Do you ever use oxen in ploughing?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",69
"70","—Not on our farm, but it is used occasionally in small places.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",70
"71","23834. Not on the larger farms?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",71
"72","—No, not generally.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",72
"73","23835. Have you got any crofters living among you —any small tenants?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",73
"74","—I don't believe there are more than ten small tenants in the parish, so far as I am aware—ten or twelve.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",74
"75","23836. Are they very small poor tenants, or are they pretty good farmers?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",75
"76","—They have just the farms let—according to the size of farms—from two or three acres to forty or fifty acres, according to the size of the property. Some tenants occupy some of the larger farms in the parish.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",76
"77","23837. Have those small tenants any pasture on the hill ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",77
"78","—They are at liberty to pasture on the hill allotted to the property.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",78
"79","23838. And that commonty is divided?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",79
"80","—Each proprietor knows his own commonty; it was all divided a number of years ago.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",80
"81","23839. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",81
"82","—Do you know which of your predecessors bought the land—was it your grandfather or some one farther back?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",82
"83","—It was some predecessor of my mother, but I cannot remember now exactly.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",83
"84","23840. Have you got regular title-deeds to your property?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",84
"85","—Yes.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",85
"86","23841. Do you know from whom the property was bought?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",86
"87","—From a party who evidently lived in the Island of Sanday, so far as I am aware; the most ancient papers we are holding state to that effect.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",87
"88","23842. Supposing you go back more than 100 years, was most of the property then in the hands of small holders like yourself?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",88
"89","—So far as I am able to judge, the present state of things has existed from time immemorial; in fact, I cannot give you any idea how long.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",89
"90","23843. Are the most of the people who hold land like yourself well off in their circumstances?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",90
"91","—I should judge so —that they are pretty comfortable generally throughout the parish.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",91
"92","23844. Do you consider it a great privilege to be proprietor of your own land? much more so than to be paying rent to another man?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",92
"93","—Certainly, it is an advantage.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",93
"94","23845. You feel it to be an advantage?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",94
"95","—Yes; but I have heard it reported that sometimes the tenants of the Earl of Zetland are as well off as our Harray lairds.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",95
"96","23846. What family have you —you are a married man?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",96
"97","—No I am not.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",97
"98","23847. Take the case of a person in your own position who is married, and suppose him to have three sons, what becomes of the two younger sons? He first, no doubt, gives them a good education. Do they leave the place and go out into the world?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",98
"99","—That depends on their own free will; they are not compelled to go out, but in general they find occupation elsewhere.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",99
"100","23848. They could not all remain at home upon the one place?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",100
"101","—It depends on the arrangement they make together—if they choose to work the farm. There is no general rule adopted so far as I am aware. ",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",101
"102","23849. And, in point of fact, the land, as you have stated, is not subdivided?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",102
"103","—No, not generally, I think.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",103
"104","23850. Is it always the eldest son, or is it the favourite son of the father, or the man in possession?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",104
"105","—I think it is, in general, the eldest son.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",105
"106","23851. Are your titles registered?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",106
"107","—All our titles are registered.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",107
"108","23852. As a rule does the property go to the eldest son?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",108
"109","—I should say yes, as a rule. Of course there may be an exception at a time when the father sees fit to give it to another; but, in general, it goes according to law.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",109
"110","23853. Do you require, in working your little property, any outside assistance?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",110
"111","—Yes, we always require hired servants.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",111
"112","23854. Do you get them from year to year or do you only call it labour as you need it?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",112
"113","—We hire them from year to year, and some of them have been with us a good many years.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",113
"114","23855. Are the poor rates in the parish very low?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",114
"115","—This is a united parish; Harray and Birsay are united so far as poor rates are concerned. The poor-rates this year will be about 10d. in the pound.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",115
"116","23856. It is from Birsay that the poor people come?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",116
"117","—No, not them all; but I suppose the greater number of them are there.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",117
"118","23857. Is it or is it not the case that there is a comparatively small number of paupers is this parish?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",118
"119","—There are very few.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",119
"120","23858. I presume that any near relations—say women who have come to years, connections of small proprietors—these small proprietors would not allow them to go on the poor's roll unless in exceptional circumstances?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",120
"121","—I think it is sometimes the case, even in Harray, that poor people are supported by their relatives rather than allow them to go on the poors' roll.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",121
"122","23859. Is it generally the case among the small proprietors that they don't allow their poor relations to go on the roll?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",122
"123","—I would not say as a general rule, but it is sometimes done in Harray, that parties in circumstances to require aid are supported by their nearest relatives.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",123
"124","23860. Are you all quite contented in this parish—have you no grievance whatever?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",124
"125","—I cannot speak for others, but I suppose there is no grievance we need care to mention. There is no grievance I am aware of worth mentioning.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",125
"126","23861. Are there sales going on—is the sale of a small property a common thing; or do the people contrive to stick to the properties?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",126
"127","—There are sales of property occasionally.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",127
"128","23862. Who buys? Is it the neighbours, or new people who want to become proprietors?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",128
"129","—Generally parties through the country. There have been farms sold in Harray of late years, and they have been bought up by parties living in other parts of the mainland of Orkney.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",129
"130","23863. We have been told that a rumour has got abroad that the Commissioners now sitting have come here for the purpose of raising assessments. Did you here any story to that effect?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",130
"131","—No, we did not hear it, and we would not have believed it if we had heard it.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",131
"132","23864. You have been reading the newspapers, and have observed the nature of the inquiries as they have been going along?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",132
"133","—Yes, I have been doing so all the time since the Commissioners came through the country.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",133
"134","23865. Do you wish to make any voluntary statement to us?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",134
"135","—No, I am not prepared to make any statement. I came here simply from curiosity. We did not hear of your coming until two days ago. We have no delegates appointed; we just came from curiosity to hear what was to be said. I did not expect or intend to give evidence or make any statement.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",135
"136","23866. The Chairman.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",136
"137","—If there was no warning it was because we did not suppose that the people here had any grievance",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",137
"138","—being proprietors and independent people. We did not suppose they had the same sort of complaints to make.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",138
"139","23867. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",139
"140","—Do you pay any feu duty?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",140
"141","—Our feu duties were purchased upwards of sixty years ago, I think.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",141
"142","23868. And you are perfectly free—there is no feu duty?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",142
"143","—No feu duty.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",143
"144","23869. Was that purchased from the Earl of Zetland ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",144
"145","—Yes.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",145
"146","23870. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",146
"147","—Where do you get your hired servants?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",147
"148","—Through the parish generally.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",148
"149","23871. Are they sons and daughters of the lairds in the parish1?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",149
"150","—They are not always lairds, of course,—working people; their daughters more frequently hire out as servants than the daughters of the lairds.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",150
"151","23872. There are working people living in the parish?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",151
"152","—Exactly.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",152
"153","23873. Do they pay rent for their houses these working people?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",153
"154","—I think so in general.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",154
"155","23874. What sort of rent do they pay for it —money or service?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",155
"156","—I think in general it is money.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",156
"157","23875. Have they land along with their houses?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",157
"158","—Generally small portions of land are allotted with their houses. Some labourers have built houses on the commonty belonging to the proprietors, and they get as much of commonty as they like to cultivate.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",158
"159","23876. What sort of rent do they pay for it ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",159
"160","—That depends on the kind of commons they cultivate and undertake to cultivate.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",160
"161","23877. Do they build their own houses?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",161
"162","—Generally, I think.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",162
"163","23878. And they pay a nominal rent for the land before they take it in?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",163
"164","—They pay a nominal rent for a number of years —a mere nominal rent generally.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",164
"165","23879. Are there many persons in that position in the parish?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",165
"166","—Not a great many.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",166
"167","23880. You say that a number of the younger members of the families, of the proprietors in the parish go out into the world —go to the colonies and into trade—is it considered an advantage to stick to the land rather than to be sent out into the world?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",167
"168","—I suppose it is considered an advantage by the party to whom the land belongs to stick to it.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",168
"169","23881. I mean, a member of a family would prefer to have the land left to him rather than to go out into trade?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",169
"170","—It is generally when the proprietor has the land that he sticks to it in preference to employing his time in any other business.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",170
"171","23882. Any of them would prefer to have the land rather than go out into the world?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",171
"172","—I think so.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",172
"173","23883. But some of the members of families of proprietors have been very successful, have they not, in other parts of the world?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",173
"174","—Yes, perhaps some of the younger members have been fully as successful as those who stick to the land.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",174
"175","23881. Yet the young men would prefer to stick to the land?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",175
"176","—Yes, I should think so.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",176
"177","23885. When there is land for sale here is there much demand for it ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",177
"178","—Yes, there is a very keen competition.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",178
"179","23886. What sort of prices does it fetch—how many years' purchase?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",179
"180","—I am scarcely prepared to answer that question; the farms which have been sold of late years have been sold very high.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",180
"181","23887. What in your opinion is a high price? Take a farm worth £40 a year on the valuation roll, what would you call a high price for that, would you think it dear at £1000?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",181
"182","—No, a farm that would fetch £40 of rent would sell at a much higher figure than £1000, according to the prices of the farms that have been sold. There have been farms sold of late years that would not bring £40, which have- realised more than £1000.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",182
"183","23888. Would you think £1200 too much for it ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",183
"184","—Not according to the rate at which farms have sold.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",184
"185","23889. You would not think that dear as farms have been going?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",185
"186","—I think as farms have been going that would not be considered dear.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",186
"187","23890. Do you find agriculture a profitable business here ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",187
"188","—Of recent years it has done very well; of course it depends a great deal on the prices we obtain for stock. We depend principally on stock-raising here.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",188
"189","23891. Do you think that if there were land for sale, and the Government were to advance money for the purchase of it in small farms, persons could be found to purchase it and to pay 6½ per cent, of the purchase money—that would redeem the price in twenty-five years ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",189
"190","—I can scarcely express an opinion upon that point.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",190
"191","23892. That would be paying nearly double the rent on a £40 farm. If you paid £1200, that would be £80 a year, over the twenty-five years, to make it your own. Would it be possible for a purchaser to make that money out of the farm?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",191
"192","—I scarcely think it, after paying the necessary expenses.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",192

"197","23895. Professor Mackinnon.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",197
"198","—When you allow a tenant to settle upon the commonty and take in so much land at a small rent, I suppose he never gets any lease of it, or anything of that sort ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",198
"199","—There are tenants settled on parts of the commonty belonging to the proprietors in Harray who have leases.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",199
"200","23896. From the proprietor of the commonty upon which they have sat down ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",200

"202","23897. And it is not very common to grant' leases to tenants when making places for themselves on the commonty ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",202
"203","—Yes, they get a lease now and again.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",203
"204","23898. You say that subdivision is a comparatively rare thing on these properties. Is it a rare thing also for a neighbour to purchase an adjoining property when it falls vacant, so as to have two instead of one ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",204
"205","—When it happens that the property is for sale it sometimes occurs that the adjoining farmer buys it. I know instances of such a thing taking place; but it is not often done.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",205
"206","23899. The wish to become proprietor is very general and very keen, is it?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",206
"207","—One would imagine so, from the keen competition that takes place when the farm is for sale.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",207
"208","23900. And when one gets the property and the titles, he has the power to dispose of it to any one of his children ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",208
"209","—I think so.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",209
"210","23901. In the case of a large family, where there are no means left except this property, what arrangement is made for the other members of the family by the one who suceeeds to the property ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",210
"211","—I suppose it depends on the arrangement that is made by the proprietor before his decease.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",211
"212","23902. What would be the common arrangement in the place in the case that I have stated, where there are two or three sons and two or three daughters, and the property is left to one—do the rest get anything at all?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",212
"213","—I am not prepared to express an opinion on what is generally done in that case.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",213
"214","23903. Is it usual for the one who succeeds to pay the others so much?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",214

"216","23904. You stated that you have heard it said that tenants of Lord Zetland were more comfortable than Harray lairds?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",216
"217","—Not more comfortable; but as comfortable. It is generally reckoned that they are as comfortable as some of the Harray lairds.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",217
"218","23905. Suppose they were so, would the people of this place prefer to be tenants of Lord Zetland or Harray lairds?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",218
"219","—I don't suppose they would like to change.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",219
"220","23906. Even supposing they would be as comfortable?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",220
"221","—I think their impression would be not to leave certainty for hope.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",221
"222","23907. They set value on the feeling of proprietorship?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",222
"223","—I think so.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",223

"225","—Exactly.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",225
"226","23909. And do they hold it upon lease?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",226
"227","—I think they do, generally; but I cannot state positively. It is a private matter between the tenants and the proprietor. I know that some hold upon lease, and some just from year to year.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",227
"228","23910. The Chairman",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",228

"230","—Well, I am not aware.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",230
"231","23911. It would be very uncommon?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",231
"232","—It would.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",232
"233","23912. Do the proprietors ever hire land from others and become farmers on other land; or do they restrict themselves to their own property?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",233
"234","—In general, in this parish, they restrict themselves to the cultivation of their own property; and some, when they retire from farming, leave the property aud let it to a tenant.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",234
"235","23913. You raise a good deal of oats and barley?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",235
"236","—Some.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",236

"238","—We use as much as we require of the grain we raise for the family, and what we don't require we dispose of.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",238
"239","23915. The family generally consumes the grain they actually raise on the ground?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",239

"246","—Not to any extent; there is some wool manufactured into blankets on a small scale, but not to any extent.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",246
"247","23919. If you pleased you would be quite at liberty to make up your own wool for your own use, but you prefer to buy clothes?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",247
"248","—We sometimes send our wool to the south to be manufactured into cloth, as well as plaiding and blankets.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",248
"249","23920. And you get it back again?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",249
"250","—Yes.",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",250
"251","23921. Are there no local weavers who could weave it on hand looms?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",251

"255","23923. Perhaps you prefer the manufactures of the south, or would you prefer the cloth made in the country and of your home grown wool ?",408,"Peter Smith","Orkney, Harray",255
