"1","NORMAN NICOLSON, Crofter, Brogaig (48)—examined. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",1
"2","2743. The Chairman.",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",2
"3","—Have you been freely chosen a delegate by the people of your place ?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",3
"4","—Yes. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",4
"5","2744. Will you state what are the complaints that the people make in your neighbourhood ?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",5
"6","—The first is that we were deprived of the hill pasture, and in the next place heavy rent was laid ou us, and also that the summing was too heavy for the grazing we had. The place being so poor, ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",6
"7","it would not sustain the summing, and would not do to winter them. The little grazing we have is spoiled with cutting peats. Twenty-four families cut their peats on our little bit of grazing. Formerly there were only four families in the township. There are now eleven families paying rent, and ten cottars. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",7
"8","2745. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",8
"9","—Didn't you say there were twenty-four ? ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",9
"10","—There are eleven paying rent and ten cottars, but there are twenty-four families cutting peats in our grazing. We lost the sheep. We were not allowed to keep a sheep or a horse. I myself had sheep and horses when we had the hill. I had to part with them. I was obliged to part with the sheep at that time at 7s. a head. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",10
"11","2746. Sheriff Nicolson.",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",11
"12","—When was that?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",12
"13","—About sixteen years ago. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",13
"14","2747. What kind of sheep were they ?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",14
"15","—Blackfaced. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",15
"16","2748. Who bought them ?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",16
"17","—Monkstadt, and I was thankful that he took them. I could not get any person to give me a price for them at the time, and I did it to turn them into cash, though I would like mutton as well many other person, and I would need clothes also, but I had to part with them. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",17
"18","2749. What was done with the land ?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",18
"19","—It was added to Duntulm's tack, and again, the little bit of ground that I have marches with the tack. The march dyke is made of turf, and though I should do my own share of repairing it, perhaps the tacksman would not repair his side of it during the whole year. Then again, from after this time, when the seed is in the ground, there are other matters to which some one of my family has to attend,",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",19
"20","—-to watch the crop, to keep them from the cultivated land,—until I can get it into my stackyard at my own cost, otherwise my whole toil will be lost—eaten up by the tacksman's stock. In that way we do not see that we have a means of living. Unless I would be constantly driving off the tacksman's stock, they would trespass on my lands until they would reach the sea. Then the little bits of ground we have will not afford rotation. We must needs cultivate them constantly, and therefore they become exhausted. When we had the horses I had a mare and a year-old foal. They trespassed one Sabbath eveuing on the tack. They were seized and poinded in Balmeanach. They were sent away at break of day on Monday to Duntulm before I got notice. I had then to go all the way to Duntulm—8 or 9 miles off, —to get them released. Mr Stewart, the tacksman, met me there, and told me that a judgment had come upon me for keeping so many horses, and it would be enough for tinkers to have so many horses. 1 could not answer him much, but I asked him how much the poindage would be. He told me 8s. 6d., and I paid this into his own hands. He told me I would require to work for him, so that I might get my money back ; but I gave him the money, and I did not get it back. I worked for him often, but I never got anything for it. Therefore I cannot keep the little bit of ground that I have, as it is not fenced, even should I have it for nothing. I think that is all I have to say regarding us crofters; but as to the cottars, I think they are as needy of as much land as they could pay for as we are, for unless Ave give them ground they cannot get it at all. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",20
"21","2750. How many cottars are there ?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",21
"22","—There are ten cottars. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",22
"23","2751. The Chairman.",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",23
"24","—Do the cottars pay rent for the ground ?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",24
"25","—I do not think they do. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",25
"26","2752. Do they pay rent in labour?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",26
"27","—They are not required to give labour for it ; they may do so of their own accord. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",27
"28","2753. But do they give assistance?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",28
"29","—They help us a little in the harvest. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",29
"30","2754, But they pay for the peats ?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",30
"31","—2s. a year. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",31
"32","2755. How do the cottars live? how do they gain their subsistence?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",32
"33","— Wages out of the country at the fishing and at railway works. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",33
"34","2756. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",34
"35","—You said you were deprived of grass. Was there pasture in common with townships in the east side here?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",35
"36","—Yes. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",36
"37","2757. Do I understand you are forbidden to keep horses or sheep now? ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",37
"38","—Yes, for the past sixteen years. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",38
"39","2758. Are you forbidden by the proprietor? ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",39
"40","—I believe so. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",40
"41","2759. Because the other tenants said that in consequence of this land being taken away, the Brogaig and Deig stock crowded theirs up?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",41
"42","—I believe that is so. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",42
"43","2760. But if you are forbidden to keep sheep, how does that happen ?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",43
"44","— Some of them have a few sheep. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",44
"45","2761. Then it is not actually forbidden by the proprietor. It is merely the want of land that forbids it ?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",45
"46","—The landlord forbad it. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",46
"47","2762. And some of them keep it notwithstanding ?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",47
"48","—Yes. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",48
"49","2763. Sheriff Nicolson.",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",49
"50","—How do you feed them?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",50
"51","—They graze out on the hill pasture belonging to the other townships during the summer. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",51
"52","2764. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",52
"53","—Is your township a poor one? Are the people generally poor ?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",53
"54","—They are become poor enough now. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",54
"55","2765. Are their circumstances getting worse and worse?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",55
"56","—Doubtless, they are getting worse and worse. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",56
"57","2766. Sheriff Nicolson.",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",57
"58","—Where does this pasture lie that was taken away from them ?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",58
"59","—Up to Uig and Bealach. ",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",59
"60","2767. How many sheep could it keep formerly?",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",60
"61","—I cannot tell that right, but I believe that what was taken from us of the hill would carry as many sheep as the whole of what was left to us.",45,"Norman Nicolson","Skye, Stenscholl",61
