"13","27160. Can you tell us anything about the clearances of Clashmore?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",13

"17","27162. Why were they removed; did they want to go?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",17
"18","—They were all sent out of the place but three. There were only four who left the place. One went to America. The rest were disposed of by crowding them in corners of the place near about, upon others. Some new pasture in the place itself was taken in and occupied by them; I have some of that pasture land myself, and I would be batter without it; it has been a source of expense to me ever since I got it.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",18

"25","27166. Were all the people who were removed put into smaller holdings than they had before?-",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",25

"28","—They required it all; but they are worse off since.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",28

"33","27170. Had you a good house before?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",33
"34","—It was not very good.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",34
"35","27171. Did you get any value for it when you left?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",35
"36","—I got £10 for the expenses of removal, and for building the new house, but £50 would not cover my outlay in that matter.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",36
"37","27172. Does that remark apply to the rest of the people who were in the same position as yourself?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",37
"38","—All those that were removed got from £5 to £ 10 in order to cover the expenses of removing, and building their dwellings. Three of them had slated houses and these got £10.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",38
"39","27173. What rent were you paying before?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",39

"44","27175. What stock do you keep on it?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",44
"45","—I may say I do not keep stock upon it at all. I keep two cows, but not on the income of the lot.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",45

"50","27178. Generally speaking was a piece of the farm of Clashmore taken away from you?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",50
"51","—Yes, a piece of it was taken away.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",51

"53","—Yes.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",53
"54","27180. Are you or the people in the township in arrears of rent?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",54

"56","27181. You received a reduction of £1, but I understand that there was an abatement given last year, being a bad season. Did you get the benefit of that?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",56
"57","—No, there was no abatement, beyond the £ 1 of reduction I stated before. There were three new lots made upon the bad ground at the back of the township. One of the tenants fell back in circumstances and could not keep up his lot; nobody could be got to go into the place; and when nobody could be got to take up the croft the three crofts were reduced each by £ 1 until they got a tenant for the vacant croft.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",57
"58","27182. Have you heard that the large farmers on the estate have got an abatement?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",58

"61","—What was the rent of Clashmore altogether before the improvements began?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",61
"62","—I could not tell exactly the rent of the township. We knew our own rents well, and we did not look",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",62
"63","much into the rents of our neighbours.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",63
"64","27184. What rent were you paying?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",64
"65","—Up to £ 4; the old lot was worth that rent as compared with the one I have now.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",65
"66","27185. Did the Duke of Sutherland take this piece of ground off you for the purpose of reclamation?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",66
"67","—-It was by the orders of the Duke that it was taken from us.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",67
"68","27186. What did the Duke do with it after taking it from you?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",68

"76","27190. Is the land you have been placed upon the newly reclaimed land?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",76
"77","—Yes.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",77
"78","27191. If you had leases could you have reclaimed this land yourselves?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",78
"79","—There is no soil, and it would not come under profitable cultivation within the lifetime of man.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",79
"80","27192. Do you think the landlord has made a mistake in attempting reclamation, even putting tenants out of consideration?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",80
"81","—We found it a great mistake anyhow.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",81
"82","27193. Is it not in addition to being a mistake for them, a great mistake for all parties?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",82
"83","—Probably it was.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",83
"84","27194. Did you get any material for your house besides £ 10 of money?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",84
"85","—I got a roof and lime.",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",85
"86","27195. Did you get slates?",454,"William Mathieson","Sutherland, Lochinver",86
