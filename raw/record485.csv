"1","MALCOLM MACKENZIE, North Eradale (68)—examined.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",1
"2","28884. Sheriff Nicolson.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",2
"3","—Are you prepared with any statement ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",3
"4","—I am.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",4
"5","—'At a meeting held by the crofters of North Erridale, on the 2nd day of July 1883, they resolved to place the following grievances before the Royal Commission. ",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",5
"6","(I.) Previous to 1843 the whole arable and pasture land belonging to the township was occupied by twelve crofters only, at a rent of £50, 8s. sterling. In the said year 1843 or thereabouts, and while the Gairloch estate was under trustees, the arable land was divided into lots, and for the purpose of raising more money the hill pasture was separated from the lots under a distinct rent. By this new arrangement the rents now raised, exclusive of all rates, amount to £95 sterling, making an increase on the former rent of £39, 12s. annually.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",6
"7","(II.) In the place formerly occupied by twelve, there are now twenty-three crofter families, a number which our township of North Erridale is not capable of supplying with the necessaries of life. Food for man and provender for beast must be purchased elsewhere, and the money for buying these must be earned in other places. ",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",7
"8","(III.) We do not complain of our present proprietor Sir Kenneth S. Mackenzie. Generally speaking",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",8
"9","he is a good proprietor, specially kind to poor widows who may be left with weak families, and taking a warm interest in the education of the young. But he did not remove the burden of rent laid upon us by the trustees who held the estates immediately before him. ",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",9
"10","(IV.) We want",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",10
"11","(1) the hill pasture along with our lots same as our fathers had it ; ",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",11
"12","(2) a reduction of rent; ",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",12
"13","(3) more land.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",13
"14","28885. What rent do you pay?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",14
"15","—£3, 16s.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",15
"16","28886. How much land have you ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",16
"17","—Four acres arable land.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",17
"18","28887. You pay £3, 16s. for that along with the hill pasture?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",18
"19","—Yes.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",19
"20","28888. What stock do you keep ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",20
"21","—Two cows, and two young beasts, and three or four sheep.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",21
"22","28889. Do you find the pasture too small for them ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",22
"23","—No, not for all that I have.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",23
"24","28890. You have not to buy any food for your beasts ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",24
"25","—No, if I had more I would have to buy.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",25
"26","28891. Had you ever any more than two cows?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",26
"27","—Yes, I had formerly a great many more.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",27
"28","28892. Where were you then?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",28
"29","—Just where I am. I was paying a twelfth share of the township before it was laid out.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",29
"30","28893. What stock had you then ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",30
"31","—Two horses, eight milch cows and young animals, and about fifteen sheep.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",31
"32","28894. And how much did you pay for that?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",32
"33","—-£5, 14s.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",33
"34","28895. Where were the additional crofters brought from who were put into this place in 1843 ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",34
"35","—There were some of them in the place —cottars. The greater number of them belonged to the place, and they got lots. The land yielded greater increase at that time than now. I have seen, in my day, a great many changes upon the estate. The ground yielded four times more then than it does now.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",35
"36","28896. Did any of the people come from other places ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",36
"37","—-Two or three came from the outside.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",37
"38","28897. And the other ones had been cottars until they got lots ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",38
"39","—Yes, they were cottars, they had no land except what we chose to give them.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",39
"40","28898. How did they manage to live at that time ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",40
"41","—They raised some potatoes at home, and they had fishing at home and elsewhere; and out of",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",41
"42","the proceeds of their earnings they bought meal. ",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",42
"43","28899. Was there any other land in the township that could have been given to these people to improve their position, except what was given to them?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",43
"44","—No, there was none near us that could conveniently be given. There were two bits of pasture land which belonged to us at that time, and which were afterwards given to some people who now live upon them. ",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",44
"45","28900. Was it not a great benefit to these cottars that they became crofters instead of being left as they were?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",45
"46","—We don't know that it was much to their benefit; they lived quite as well then as now.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",46
"47","28901. If they lived quite as well with a little bit of land, how is it that you are not living as well, if your land is little less than it was ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",47
"48","—Because the land does not now give the increase it did.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",48
"49","28902. Do you think that the land is so much reduced that it cannot now bring forth the same crops that it did forty years ago ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",49
"50","—It does not give such increase among us. No doubt the land has the capacity to yield it if it were made to yield it. It was by their wages that most of those cottars, who depended upon us, lived.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",50
"51","28903. What could be done to improve the land ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",51
"52","—I am an old man ; it is the young who can give that information.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",52
"53","28904. But you should have had more experience in cultivating the land ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",53
"54","—I am not so sure of that.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",54
"55","28905. Can anything be done in the way of trenching or manuring the land, more than has been done already?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",55
"56","—Yes, there could, on some of it.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",56
"57","28906. And why don't you do that?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",57
"58","—They do as much of it as they can.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",58
"59","28907. Has anybody among you any fear of being put out of his place if he improved his land ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",59
"60","—Our present proprietor is the friend of the poor; more so than any one we ever had. He is not an object of fear to any one; but we don't know what might befall.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",60
"61","28908. Do your people find a difficulty in paying their rent ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",61
"62","—Yes.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",62
"63","28909. Are they much in arrears ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",63
"64","—Yes, some of them.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",64
"65","28910. Are you yourself?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",65
"66","—Yes, I am.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",66
"67","28911. Did all the inhabitants, or those of them who could, attend the meeting at which you were chosen to represent them ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",67
"68","—The greater number of the people were away out of the place, but those who were at home were all there together when I was elected. The greater number of those who were away bad a meeting before they went.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",68
"69","28912. Are the young men all away at the fishing?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",69
"70","—Yes.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",70
"71","28913. Are you near the shore?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",71
"72","—Yes, and a very rough shore it is; we very often cannot approach it when out fishing or when getting supplies.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",72
"73","28914. Have you no good place of refuge near you?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",73
"74","—Yes, we can run into the loch here.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",74
"75","28915. Do your men fish regularly when the weather permits?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",75
"76","—Yes, the greater number of them.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",76
"77","28916. What kind of fishing ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",77
"78","—Herring, cod, and ling.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",78
"79","28917. Do they make a good thing by it when there is a good year?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",79
"80","—Yes, when it is a good year.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",80
"81","28918. Have they any difficulty in disposing of their cod and ling?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",81
"82","—No difficulty whatever.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",82
"83","28919. Who takes it from you1?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",83
"84","—There are two curers upon the other side of the loch who take it from us.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",84
"85","28920. What price do they give for cod and ling this year?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",85
"86","—8d. a fish for both the cod and ling.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",86
"87","28921. And are the men regularly paid in money for their fish?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",87
"88","—Yes, so far as I am aware.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",88
"89","28922. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",89
"90","—Were you well off before this allotting took place in 1843 ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",90
"91","—Yes, I had as much as my needs required.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",91
"92","28923. Was not the effect of the arrangement whereby eleven additional people got land in this township to impoverish both?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",92
"93","—The effect was to impoverish us who had the land; but some of those who had the land were better than they were before.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",93
"94","28924. Are they better off now—those who got it?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",94
"95","—No they are not, were it not for their earnings they would not be in any condition at all so far as their lands are concerned.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",95
"96","28925. You were asked what would be the best way to improve their condition. Supposing that these eleven crofters were settled somewhere else, and the old crofters or their descendents got the lands as they had them before—get the pasture which was taken from them —and at the old rent, would they be all right then ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",96
"97","—Very likely we should be. I cannot very accurately determine it, but it would very probably be an improvement on our condition.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",97
"98","28926. Is not that what you want in your paper?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",98
"99","—I suppose you have all seen what is in the paper.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",99
"100","28927. The hill pasture along with our lands as our fathers had it ?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",100
"101","— Yes.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",101
"102","28928. Reduction of rent ? ",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",102
"103","—Yes.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",103
"104","28929. More land? Do you approve of that?",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",104
"105","—Well, so far as I am concerned my day is nearly done, and it is but little that I can take of land. That is what the young would wish for.",485,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",105
