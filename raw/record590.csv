"4","—Yes. 'Some Particulars in the case of the Crofters and Cottars of Salen, on the Estate of Glenforsa.",590,"Lachlan Mcquarrie, Alexander Fletcher","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",4
"5","—At a numerously attended meeting held in the Temperance Hall, Salen, on the 7th of August, Mr Robert M'Lachlan in the chair, it was resolved that the undersigned should draw up a statement and present it by the hand of one of us, to the Royal Commission at Tobermory. Perhaps the best statement will be a record of what the several said to the purpose of laying their grievances before Her Majesty's representatives. By way of commencement it was asked first, "" How many of those present had enough of land ?"" and on a show of hands being called for, there was not a hand raised. Then it was asked, "" How many are there who have not enough of land ?"" and the response was all hands up. It was then asked how many there were on the estate of Glenforsa who had enough of land to live on, and the answer was "" two."" The question was then put, "" How has it come about that there are so few holding land enough, and so many having too little?"" The answer was, ""That the people had been cleared off excellent and extensive lands and the evicted sent hither and thither over the face of the earth, some settling in Salen, some in Tobermory, some in Glasgow, and many in foreign lands."" An illustration of the wholesale nature of the eviction, the following list was given of townships cleared on the one island of Ulva, premising that in 1841 the island of Ulva had a population of 859, or somewhat more being 200 above the present population of the whole quoad sacra parish of Salen :",590,"Lachlan Mcquarrie, Alexander Fletcher","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",5
"6","—from Ormaig, 7 families; Cragaig, 9 ; Kilvicewen, 6 ; Eolusary, 4 ; Glaenagallan, 4; Ballighartan, 4 ;  Beannas, 4; Cuilinis, 5 ; Abas,  5 ; Sorata, 7; Achanatutha, 4 ; Tairi-nan-Ardruidle, 3 ; Upper Ardeallani 2; Lower Ardeallam, 5; Blar-nan-Corr, 2 j Salen Buadh, 2; total, 73 families. Some of these evicted families were first removed from sufficient farms to smaller ones, then they were reduced to a house and grass for a cow or two, then to nothing at all, and when they would not clear off altogether some of them had the roofs taken off their huts. When one of them asked Mr Clark for a house, the answer given was ""No ; I am not the father of your family."" In another case there was a very sick woman with her daughter in one of the houses which Mr Clark wished to pull down. Notwithstanding the critical condition of the woman, he had the roof taken down all to a small bit right over the sick woman's bed. On other occasions he went and pleaded with the inmates to go, he giving biscuits to the children as inducements. One of the inducements offered in another case was that the parties appealed to would get good treatment in the Tobermory Poor House, as he (Mr Clark) was a member of the Parochial Board. By one means or another he got the people away, now one lot, and then another lot of them, according as he was able to stock the land. Some poor people got permission to build huts on a point which~ho one else thought worth having. By way of making the place look nicer, they planted some trees; but as that went to give them a more permanent feeling and appearance, he actually pulled up the plants, and ultimately sent the people away too. Lachlan M'Quarie (64 years), residing at Salen, and one of our delegates, had three different removals from better to worse, and from that to the other side of the Sound of Ulva. He remembers having seen seventy-three crofters in the island of Ulva, and there are now only the proprietor and his three shepherds besides two or three cottars. After the failure of the potato the present proprietor (Mr Clark) cleared off the crofters from about the half of the island first, and put sheep in their place; and as his stock was increasing he gradually cleared off the rest of the crofters till he had all the island cleared, with the exception of one small place, Ardglass, where he allowed three or four to put up huts for themselves to remain there for a little, but it was not very long till he sent them after the rest. He (Lachlan M'Quarie) rented a croft himself in Ormaig at £13 rent; another came, offered more, and got that croft. Some time after he got a small croft in another place, Cragaig. In a short time again be was warned out of there also, and on refusing to leave his house was stripped by a policeman and sheriff officer along with the proprietor and some of his working men. Being then homeless, having a wife and three young children, he had to take the couples (being his own) that were on the house, carry them to the shore, and put up a hut for himself there, about six yards above high-water mark. Being a lobster fisher also, he had intended to have stayed there for some time, and support his family at that calling; but was not above a week there when the proprietor came riding to him, and said he was vexed for the young children and was afraid they would catch cold, and he could only reply in astonishment to the proprietor, "" Why then, if you are so anxious about them, did you strip the house above their heads ?"" He then offered him a house at Coalas at £ 3 rent, which (glad for the time to get anything) he accepted, and lived there solely by fishing for three years, when he was again glad to leave of his own accord. He also remembers the proprietor closing up with stones the only good well near him and the rest of the poor people living there, because it was on M'Quarie and his (Mr Clark's) ground at the roadside leading to his house. He also remembers a poor woman being at this same well one day, when she, terrified at seeing Mr Clark coming, ran away and left her kettle at the well, which Mr Clark took hold of and smashed to pieces. Another poor woman left her body clothes to bleach by the same roadside, and on Mr Clark coming the way he saw them and tore them in pieces. In these and similar ways he succeeded only too well in clearing the island of its once numerous inhabitants, scattering them over the face of the globe, as already stated. With reference to the clearances on the Glenforsa estate, it is but proper to state that they were all effected before the present proprietor came into possession. But the lands were nevertheless cleared, and the people now remain without. By way of example, we can give the names of—well, of a dozen of townships which were cleared right away one after another, without leaving a living, with the exception of one. Alexander Fletcher, shoemaker, 73 years, residing at Salen, and one of our delegates, remembers having seen ( 1 ) 11 crofters in Leitir, 6 in Corachaidh, 1 in Pennygown, 1 in Cuocubuntata, 3 in Rohill, 3 in Gaydale, 1 in Croich, 1 iu Kilbeg, 1 in Callachly, 6 in Torlochan ; total, 34 in Glenforsa estate. He also remembers having seen (2) 8 crofters at Tishnish, 2 at Corrynaheucha (parish of Salen), and (3) 14 between Killechronan and Kellan Mill, parish of Salen. All these were then in good circumstances but now are all in the hands of the proprietors, with the exception of (1) a single farmer in all that ground, who has Pennygown, Corachadh, and Rohill. Number 2 is entirely in proprietor's (Mr Guthrie's) hands.  As also number 3, in the hands of Mr Parr, the proprietor, with the exception of one small croft at Kellan Mill. So well populated were these places that he (A. Fletcher, delegate,) remembers seeing seven weddings in one day at Salen, and now for the past several decades there has scarcely been one in a twelvemonth; he remembers the time when there would be not less than 800 bolls of meal ground in one year at the mill of Kellan, and now there is no use for a mill, and not a boll made there. Everything has been to reduce the number of the people, in many cases by means which certainly were anything but creditable to humanity. There is some employment given about, but the wages are only 2s. a day, ; and with the exception of what grows with those who have a bit of garden, everything has to be bought. Even the milk, which should be plentiful in the district, is deplorably scarce, and those who have cows : have to pay for fodder and for bad pasture. And now, when there would seem to be some hope that better times are coming, and the big farms are falling into the hands of the proprietors, the majority of the landless people are so poor that even were lands offered them they could not stock crofts without assistance, and they are not very clear as to how the assistance could be obtained. We understand that money is got for drain-making, for fencing, and the like, and possibly poor people on the security of the stock or of the landlords, might have money from Government, until they were able to repay the loan. W« can only hope that the Royal Commission's report to the Government and Parliament will lead to the formation of a plan by which the lands now waste will be placed at the disposal of the people now without, and that some way of helping them to stock and crop their farms will be devised.",590,"Lachlan Mcquarrie, Alexander Fletcher","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",6
