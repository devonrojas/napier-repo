"1","ALLAN M'INTYRE, Cottar and Fisherman, Castle Bay and Glen (nearly 60)—examined.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",1
"2","10843. The Chairman. Have you been freely elected a delegate?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",2
"3","— Yes. ",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",3
"4","10844. Have you got any statement to make on behalf of the people here?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",4
"5","—Castle Bay in my first recollection was tenanted by ten families. They kept a stock of from two to seven cows each family, and their crofts provided them with food. Now they have only about the fourth part of that place, and there are twenty-two families paying rent in it. There are thirty families in addition to these, without land at all, located among them. They have no way of living unless they get a piece of land to assist them, whether it be great or smalL They cannot do without land —those who can afford to take a larger portion to get a larger portion, and those who can only afford a small portion to get that portion. We were promised a piece of land this year, which was cleared for us and which we had before, and we got permission to prepare some of it for potatoes; but we did not get power to take possession of the land, only that we would get this potato ground in it and permission to graze a cow upon it, and to build a house outside its bounds upon the other land that was adjacent. We paid 10s. 6d. of rent for the site of that house. We have no way of living unless we get some of that land by which people were able to live formerly in comfort. Some additional land that was promised to the people they were speaking about to the factor, and they sent some of their number to Aberdeen to see what answer they would get about Vatersay. I am not quite certain of the details of what passed between them and the factor about that place, but there is one present here to say a few words on the subject in my stead, and he can tell all about it. ",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",5
"6","10845. Sheriff Nicolson.—How many crofters round Castle Bay do you represent?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",6
"7","—Twenty-two.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",7
"8","10846. Are there cottars besides?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",8
"9","—Thirty or thirty-two cottars in addition.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",9
"10","10847. What rent do you pay?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",10
"11","—I have no land.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",11
"12","10848. What do you pay for your house?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",12
"13","—Nothing; I have no house but one built between sea water and land, which is only habitable for six months of the year. It was dry when it was good weather. ",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",13
"14","10849. Do you get any ground to put potatoes in?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",14
"15","—No, only I got a little this year to make potatoes in the place I have spoken of. ",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",15
"16","10850. Do the other cottars live in like manner?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",16
"17","—They must needs do so.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",17
"18","10851. Do they not pay any rent either?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",18
"19","—Some pay and some do not.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",19
"20","10852. How long have you been there?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",20
"21","—I was born in this villige. I am fourteen years in my present house.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",21
"22","10853. Had your father a croft ?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",22
"23","—Yes.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",23
"24","10854. In Castle Bay ?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",24
"25","—Yes.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",25
"26","10855. Who got the croft when he died?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",26
"27","—I had it myself for a while.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",27
"28","10856. How did you lose it?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",28
"29","—Another man was put down alongside of me on a portion of it, and then what was left to me was so small that it was not worth while to be looking after it.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",29
"30","10857. Did the other man get the whole of it?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",30
"31","—No, he had not it himself for a long time, when other two were placed upon him. ",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",31
"32","10858. How many cottars have been added to the population of Castle Bay in your recollection ?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",32
"33","—The whole of them. When my father had the land I never saw a cottar—only the ten who held the land.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",33
"34","10859. Did any of them come from any other place, or are they all natives of Castle Bay?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",34
"35","—Some of them were born here, others came from elsewhere.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",35
"36","10860. How do you make your living yourself?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",36
"37","—By day's wages.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",37
"38","10861. What work do you get?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",38
"39","—Curing fish with Mr Macneill for the last four years. Before that I was a fisherman. ",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",39
"40","10862. When you are not curing fish, what work do you get?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",40
"41","—I am a fish-curer during the whole year.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",41
"42","10863. I suppose you buy all the meal and potatoes for yourself and your family?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",42
"43","—It is six years since I ate anything that grew in Barra, whatever may happen with regard to the small patch that I planted this year.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",43
"44","10864. You have no cow ?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",44
"45","—No.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",45
"46","10865. Have any of the other cottars cows?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",46
"47","—One or two of them have a cow.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",47
"48","10866. Where do you get milk if you get any?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",48
"49","—I know no such thing as milk. I don't know what it means for a number of years. There is not a place here where milk can be had. Can I get it from the man who has it not?—who requires it as much as I do.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",49
"50","10867. Then of course you are obliged to take tea, sugar, treacle, and such things, instead of milk ?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",50
"51","—We are obliged to take gruel.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",51
"52","10868. Are things worse than they were when your father was alive?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",52
"53","—We are just able to live.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",53
"54","10869. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh. What family have you?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",54
"55","—Four children.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",55
"56","10870. Are some of them young?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",56
"57","—One of them is a lad of 16; then there is a girl of 12, a girl of 9, and lad of 6, besides my wife. ",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",57
"58","10871. Do your children know what milk is?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",58
"59","—They are more ignorant of milk than I am, because I knew it once.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",59
"60","10872. Mr Cameron",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",60
"61","—Do you know why the cottare were put into that place among the crofters as you have described? —Because there was no other place for them to go to clearing the places in which people were before and putting them in here as into a fank.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",61
"62","10873. Was it not for the purpose of following the fishing?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",62
"63","—No, some of those who were sent here would be of no use for fishing.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",63
"64","10874. Have any of the cottars sheep?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",64
"65","—I am not quite certain, but I believe two or three have a sheep or two.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",65
"66","10875. Have they any stirks ?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",66
"67","—Yes.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",67
"68","10876. And horses ?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",68
"69","—Yes.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",69
"70","10877. Then they have got some stock?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",70
"71","—It is not known whose that stock is. It is really stock that is dying upon the place—they have nothing to support it.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",71
"72","10878. Then in that case there is no use inquiring?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",72
"73","—Well, I believe it would be very difficult to determine accurately to whom it belongs.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",73
"74","10879. Where is it that this stock lives or starves as you describe it?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",74
"75","—Upon the pasture of the place.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",75
"76","10880. Is any rent paid for that?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",76
"77","—I believe a little is paid.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",77
"78","10881. To whom?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",78
"79","—To the crofter that gives permission to them.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",79
"80","10882. Where does the wintering come from?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",80
"81","—It is very difficult to tell—scouring the country to get a bit of fodder from one there and here as one can buy it.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",81
"82","10883. I understand that what you want is more ground?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",82
"83","—We cannot do without land anyhow.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",83
"84","10884. What was the ground you set your hearts upon?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",84
"85","—We don't care except to get land that will yield crops.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",85
"86","10885. You mentioned first a piece of land which you had right to, and then you mentioned Vatersay. Why was it that you wanted to get?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",86
"87","— It is the island of Vatersay that the crofters specially wanted. I don't know whether the crofters particularly wanted it.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",87
"88","10886. What stock does Vatersay carry?",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",88
"89","—I cannot say. ",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",89
"90","10887. Do you think that the Castle Bay tenants would be able to purchase the stock of Vatersay, or to put a full stock on Vatersay ?—Yes, that was their opinion.",183,"Allan Mcintyre","Barra, Castlebay",90
