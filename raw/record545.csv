"28","—They pound our horses occasionally.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",28
"29","32425. Do your horses go on Mr Mitchell's land?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",29

"31","32426. Would you like to have a fence between the farm and your pasture?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",31

"46","—Yes, all my time it was at £14 until then.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",46
"47","32434. Considering the increased price of cattle, is it dearer now at £16 than when you began at £14?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",47
"48","—No, I rather think not; I think it is about as cheap now as it was at £14. But it was very much cheaper than £14 long before that.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",48
"49","32435. Have the rents of the large farms in this neighbourhood been reduced?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",49

"62","—No, never.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",62
"63","32442. Any fence?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",63
"64","—Some wire fencing.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",64
"65","32443. What have you done to your house? Have you improved it?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",65
"66","—No; I have done nothing to the house since I got possession of the land.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",66
"67","32444. Is it slated?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",67
"68","—No; we built it ourselves.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",68
"69","32445. Is it a thatched house?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",69
"70","—Yes, a thatched house.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",70
"71","32446. You have a better croft than is common in this country; do you make a living out of it for your family, or do you work for wages?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",71
"72","—I could not make a living off my croft; I buy and sell.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",72
"73","32447. So you don't fish?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",73
"74","—No; I was brought up in one of the townships named already as having been in the back glen which was cleared ; my father was one of the last that was dispossessed. ",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",74
"75","32448. Do you consider yourself much better off with this croft than those who have got one acre of land and who live by fishing?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",75
"76","—Yes, I consider myself better off than they are.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",76
"77","32449. And if there were more crofts of the same kind as yours would the people be happier and better off?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",77
"78","—Yes, if they only got them a little cheaper. There is no place in the whole country dearer than our place. I show an old receipt, of date 1838, for £16 on account of rent.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",78
"79","32450. Had your father a croft on the big glen worth £16 a year at that time?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",79
"80","—Yes, my father paid £16 of rent for his croft, and it was well worth that. There were four of them, and they each had ten milk cows and near about one hundred sheep each. They left it twenty years ago.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",80
"81","32451. When these crofters went away did they go of their own free will or were they forced away?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",81
"82","—They were forced out.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",82
"83","32452. Did any of them go to America?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",83
"84","—No, the old man explained what became of them; they removed here and there.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",84
"85","32453. Do you want more land?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",85
"86","—Yes, we want more land; and now that the proprietor has plenty of land in his own hands, and is wishing to let it, we do not see very well why he should not give it out to those of us who could afford to take it, when we would be willing to pay at the same rate of rent as the large farms.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",86
"87","32454. What land has the proprietor in his own hands?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",87
"88","—Eilanreoch.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",88
"89","32455. Professor Maekinnon.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",89
"90","—What amount of land would you yourself be able or willing to take?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",90
"91","—I would take about 300 or 400 acres.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",91
"92","32456. What would be about the rent of the place you would wish to take?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",92
"93","—Between £30 and £40.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",93
"94","32457. That would be about the size of the place your father had long ago?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",94
"95","—Yes.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",95
"96","32458. And you think the place for which he paid £16 would now-a-days be worth £30 or £40?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",96
"97","—Thereabout",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",97
"98","32459. The Chairman.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",98
"99","—You would require to leave your present place if you got such a place as that?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",99
"100","—I would be quite willing to do that. Three were ejected from this place in order to make room for us when we went there, and some would be only too glad to get back even at the present day.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",100
"101","32460. Can you say how those in your father's position were able to stand the shock of the potato famine?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",101
"102","—He never got any assistance at that time, although, no doubt, it gave them a heavy blow. Still, they",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",102
"103","had sufficient means to be able to do without assistance, and if they had been left in the land they would have been able to hold it. They were not a penny in arrears.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",103
"104","32461. Professor Mackinnon.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",104
"105","—And did he always consider it a loss to have had to leave that place and go where he went to?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",105
"106","—Yes.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",106
"107","32462. He would have preferred to remain where he was?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",107
"108","—Yes.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",108
"109","32463. Do you remember what amount of stock he would have when he left it?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",109
"110","—About twelve milk cows, and one hundred sheep, and horses.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",110
"111","32464. And he was not in arrears of rent nor in debt in any way?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",111
"112","—No. ",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",112
"113","32465. That was thirty years ago?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",113
"114","—Yes.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",114
"115","32466. And his neighbours were in the same way?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",115
"116","—Yes, one of them; the other two were not so good. My father was born in Swordlan, and he was removed to this place; but his two grandfathers were in this same township to which he himself was afterwards removed",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",116
"117","32467. So that your people have been living on this land for a long time?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",117
"118","—Yes.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",118
"119","32468. You don't come from Skye?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",119
"120","—No.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",120
"121","32469. You are no relations of the pipers of Dunvegan?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",121
"122","—I cannot say.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",122
"123","32470. Is the name M'Crimmon common in this country?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",123
"124","—No.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",124
"125","32471. Have you any knowledge of how your family came to this place?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",125
"126","—No.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",126
"127","32472. But you have been here for a long time?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",127
"128","—We have been here for at least five or six generations.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",128
"129","32473. Do you, who were in the big glen with your father, believe that that glen could be repeopled with such substantial tenants as your own father was, if the proprietor would give it back to you again?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",129
"130","—Yes; but the delegate didn't mention the other side of the glen. There is a river coming down through the glen, and the other side is mostly the same as the big side. The other side of the glen could be peopled quite as well. I remember myself of a few tenants who were there at one time. I have a chair in my house which was made out of a portion of the timber of a house which was burned at the time Prince Charles went through the country. That shows that my people have been in the country for a long time.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",130
"131","32474. The Chairman.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",131
"132","—Was that the old house of your grandfather?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",132
"133","—It was the same house, but we rebuilt it just before we were removed finally out of it.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",133
"134","32475. When you removed did you receive any compensation for the new house you built?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",134
"135","—No, not a penny. We were only a year or two in the place, when we saw that they thought to remove us again. By that time we had the dwelling-house and offices built.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",135
"136","32476. But you were not removed?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",136
"137","—No, we were not. They tried to remove me again last year.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",137
"138","32477. Why?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",138
"139","—[Exhibits summons of ejectment.] This decree was not executed. I went to the factor and saw him, and he told me to go away home, and I would get leave to stay as long as I paid my rent. Last Whitsunday he went and took down the very fence I put up myself, saying that I had more land than my neighbours. This was about the land I reclaimed myself. His manager measured it out three times, and upon each occasion he found a different measurement. When the proprietor died last year, I got an invitation to the funeral along with many others, and I and one or two of the smaller tenants went to the funeral, and very shortly afterwards the factor gave me this paper, and attempted to eject me.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",139
"140","32478. Do you know what they meant or intended by this summons of ejectment?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",140
"141","—They wanted us to make a club stock of the sheep.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",141
"142","32479. They did not really want to turn you out?",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",142
"143","—He wished to eject me, evidently, because I was of the old stock of the land.",545,"William Mccrimmon","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",143
