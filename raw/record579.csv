"1","JAMES WYLLIE, Chamberlain to the Duke of Argyll—examined.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",1
"2","34867. The Chairman.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",2
"3","—How long have you been chamberlain here ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",3
"4","—Eleven years.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",4
"5","34868. Does your authority extend over the whole of this parish ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",5
"6","—Yes, so far as it belongs to the Duke of Argyll.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",6
"7","34869. I am afraid I must ask you some questions referring to things long before the period of your administration; were you employed in any other capacity on the estate in previous years ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",7
"8","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",8
"9","34870. Had you any personal knowledge of the place at an earlier period ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",9
"10","—No; I am afraid I cannot answer anything before my own time; I know nothing about what took place before.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",10
"11","34871. You cannot, for instance, explain why there was an increase of rent on some of the townships, or at least in one township, in the year 1850?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",11
"12","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",12
"13","34872. But there was a larger increase of rent in the township in the year 1876 ; have you any knowledge of that transaction?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",13
"14","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",14
"15","34873. What was the consideration which justified the increase of rental in the year 1876?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",15
"16","—The great advance in the value of sheep and cattle.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",16
"17","34874. Was it a general rise all over the crofting lands of this estate ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",17
"18","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",18
"19","34875. What did it amount to per cent.; 30 per cent. ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",19
"20","—I could not answer that question.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",20
"21","34876. But there was a rise of rent in the year 1876 all over the estate?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",21
"22","—Yes. ",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",22
"23","34877. Was that imposed in consequence of a revaluation ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",23
"24","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",24
"25","34878. Who was the revaluation conducted by ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",25
"26","—It was begun in Mr Campbell's time, and I carried it out. I made my own valuation afterwards, and carried out what he began. There was one of the township's in Iona where the increase was made before I got charge of the property All the rest were carried out after I got charge of the property.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",26
"27","34879. But the increase on this part of the estate was carried out by your own estimate of what was a fair rental ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",27
"28","—Yes, and taking what information I could get amongst Mr Campbell's papers.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",28
"29","34880. In forming your estimate, did you adhere substantially to his views, or was your estimate a reduction of what he had proposed ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",29
"30","—Generally I adhered to his views, as I knew so little of the estate at that time.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",30
"31","34881. I find on page 8 of the Appendix to Sir John M'Neill's Report in 1851, that the whole rent of the united parishes is estimated at £4371. Can you tell mo what the whole rental of the united parishes is now ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",31
"32","—It is in the valuation roll £8599,",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",32
"33","34882. Can you tell me what the rental of the Duke of Argyll's property was in 1851?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",33
"34","—It was £3799 in 1853; that is in all the parishes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",34
"35","34883. What is it now?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",35
"36","—£6389 in all the parishes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",36
"37","34884. So that there has been a rise of rental on the estate in all the parishes of £2590. Can you tell me in a general way whether this rise of rental has been greater on farms above £ 30 a year in value than in those below £30 a year ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",37
"38","—I think pretty equally on both.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",38
"39","34885. You think that all classes of farms are rented pretty nearly on equal terms ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",39
"40","—I think so.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",40
"41","34886. There has been therefore a rise of 69 per cent, upon the rental of this class of property during the last thirty years; do you consider that a rise of 70 per cent, on this class of property is justified by the increase of value in the prices of the stock ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",41
"42","—I should think so.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",42
"43","34887. When you say that this rise of 70 per cent, is justified by increase in the price of stock, would that be giving the whole benefit of the increase in the price of stock to the landlord ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",43
"44","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",44
"45","34888. You think that a fair share would still remain to the tenant ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",45
"46","—I think so.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",46
"47","34889. What has been the rise in that time ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",47
"48","—The price of stock has almost doubled since 1853.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",48
"49","34890. We have heard a very general complaint made that although the price of stock has risen very much the quality of the land of the small holdings has deteriorated by constant cropping; is that consistent with your knowledge and experience ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",49
"50","—It ought not to do, if there is a proper rotation followed.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",50
"51","34891. But have the small tenants always room to follow rotation ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",51
"52","—They ought to have upon this estate.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",52
"53","34892. Is there any rule upon the estate with reference to systematic rotation ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",53
"54","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",54
"55","34893. Is it enforced ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",55
"56","—Not very stringently.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",56
"57","34894. The crofters very generally allege that although their crofts are estimated by the estate to keep a certain number of cattle, they are practically obliged to buy a great deal in for the wintering; is that consistent",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",57
"58","with your knowledge?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",58
"59","—No; I cannot speak to that of my own knowledge; but the summing, generally speaking, has been very much fixed by the crofters themselves at first.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",59
"60","34895. But since that summing -was fixed is it not the case that portions of their hill pasture have frequently been withdrawn ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",60
"61","—Not on this property, with one exception.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",61
"62","34896. During your period?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",62
"63","—Since 1853 there has been no withdrawal except on one occasion.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",63
"64","34897. Has there been practically any consolidation of land since you have been connected with the estate; I mean have any small holdings been consolidated in large holdings ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",64
"65","—Very little in that way.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",65
"66","34898. Have you at this moment more farms on the estate under your management exceeding £100 than you had when you came into office?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",66
"67","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",67
"68","34899. There has been no consolidation?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",68
"69","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",69
"70","34900. No deprivation of hill pasture ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",70
"71","—None in my time.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",71
"72","34901. And no eviction except for non-payment of rent?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",72
"73","—Not even for that.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",73
"74","34902. You have had no eviction at all ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",74
"75","—No",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",75
"76","34903. No person has been removed ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",76
"77","—Not by a sheriff-officer.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",77
"78","34904. Or by pressure on the part of the authorities ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",78
"79","—No, not since I came into authority.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",79
"80","34905. We have heard here and elsewhere that peculiar regulations with reference to widows are enforced upon the Duke of Argyll's estate; would you give us a statement of what these regulations are, if they",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",80
"81","exist ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",81
"82","—There are no regulations whatever about widows; that is to say, there is no regulation such as I have heard mentioned to day. At this present time there are thirty-six widows in possession in Tyree and three on this property in Mull.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",82
"83","34906. Have you any printed regulations which are made known to the tenants at all ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",83
"84","—We have printed regulations.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",84
"85","34907. Can you put in a copy of them ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",85
"86","—I have not a copy here",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",86
"87","34908. Can you furnish one afterwards?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",87
"88","—Certainly.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",88
"89","34909. Is there in these printed regulations an article as to widows at all ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",89
"90","—Not a word.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",90
"91","34910. What is the practice of the estate with reference to widows; when a woman becomes a widow and has a son able to assist her, or who will shortly be able to assist her, in the management of the croft, is the croft continued to the widow and son ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",91
"92","—Generally speaking. The Duke uses his own discretion in the matter.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",92
"93","34911. In the particular case?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",93
"94","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",94
"95","34912. When there is a widow without a son, or without any male relative able to assist her in the croft, if she has herself some means and stock and is capable of managing the croft, is she allowed to remain or not ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",95
"96","—There is no general rule; the Duke exercises his own discretion in every case.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",96
"97","34913. Are there many cases in which such an unassisted widow is allowed to remain ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",97
"98","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",98
"99","34914. And in case a widow is removed from the croft on the death of her husband, in consequence of not being supported by a male relative, what description of provision is made for her ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",99
"100","—Generally speaking, I should say she gets a house; if she is well off, she looks out for a house for herself.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",100
"101","34915. If she is not well off the Duke provides her with a house?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",101
"102","—Yes ; that would be the rule. I cannot speak of any particular case at this moment",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",102
"103","34916. Are you aware of cases in which widows are so supplied with houses ",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",103
"104","—I don't recollect of any cases recently.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",104
"105","34917. I placed in your hands a copy of Sir John M'Neill’s in which a statement was made in reference to the large outlay in the famine years, between 1846 and 1851; had that statement ever come under your notice before?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",105
"106","—I have heard it merely; I have never seen it before.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",106
"107","34918. Did you observe the statement in the report I gave to you was not distinctly supported in the appendix by any particular reference ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",107
"108","—I did not observe that.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",108
"109","34919. You cannot give any information upon that?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",109
"110","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",110
"111","34920. Did you ever hear it reported in the country that the great outlay stated to have been made on the Duke's estate at that period —no doubt, as far as he is concerned, justly —had been abusively or wastefully",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",111
"112","applied ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",112
"113","—No, decidedly not.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",113
"114","34921. Where were you yourself resident about the famine years ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",114
"115","—I think I was upon Breadalbane at that time.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",115
"116","34922. We have heard a very general complaint of common pasture having been withdrawn, no doubt at an earlier period than you are acquainted with ; do you think that cases may or may not arise in which any pasture might be taken from the larger farms and restored to the crofters ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",116
"117","—Not without detriment to the farms, and I should not like to give my opinion upon that. That lies entirely with the Duke.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",117
"118","34923. Do you think it could be done with advantage to crofters?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",118
"119","—Yes, but not with advantage to the farms.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",119
"120","34924. But in a case of this sort, which do you think is the weightiest consideration, the welfare of the farm or the welfare of the crofting class ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",120
"121","—The crofting class is more numerous; I should not like to answer that,",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",121
"122","34925. The balance of your opinion is rather in favour of improving the crofting class, perhaps at some little detriment to the farms ? The question is, are the crofts too small at present ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",122
"123","—I am not prepared to say that they are on this estate; I think they are a very good size on this estate.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",123
"124","34926. I put the question with reference to the common pasture, and not arable ground ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",124
"125","—It depends entirely on the estate. There is not one case where a small portion has been taken from a township.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",125
"126","34927. But my question was, whether land either once common pasture, or which had never been common pasture, might be taken with advantage from the larger farms and given back to the crofters, not with advantage to the farm, but with advantage to the crofters ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",126
"127","—It depends entirely on the state of those crofters; what size their common pasture is—whether they are in need.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",127
"128","34928. In fact, it depends on individual cases ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",128
"129","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",129
"130","34929. And you could not give a general opinion ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",130
"131","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",131
"132","34930. You have no opinion as to the policy of increasing the area of the common pasture ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",132
"133","—Not unless it is required.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",133
"134","34931. And do you think it is generally required or not?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",134
"135","—In some cases it may, and in some it is not.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",135
"136","34932. Mr Cameron.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",136
"137","—You said just now, in answer to the Chairman, that the rise of rent between 1853 and 1876 was equally divided between the large and small farms; do you mean by that that the rise was divided proportionately between the large and small tenants, or absolutely ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",137
"138","—I consider that the rents of the farms are as dear as the rents of the crofts; in fact, they are very much rented upon the same principle, according to the class of stock kept upon them.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",138
"139","34933. But when you were asked as to a certain sum which represented the rise of rent, whether that was a rise of rent upon the large or small farms, you replied it was equally divided: was the sum divided into two, one half of which was upon the small and the other half upon large, or did you mean that the proportion upon each was the same upon the large and small ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",139
"140","—I should say the proportion was the same.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",140
"141","34934. What is the rental of the large as compared with the small farms ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",141
"142","—The area is not the same.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",142
"143","34935. But what is the rental ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",143
"144","—-The total rental in 1853 was £3799 ; in 1883, £6389.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",144
"145","34936. That shows a rise of rent of £2590 : what I do not understand is, whether the amount of, say £1290, was a rise upon the large and the other half upon the small, or whether the £2590 was a rise proportionately?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",145
"146","—Proportionately.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",146
"147","34937. So that the rise was proportionately the same on the large as upon the small ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",147
"148","—That is my opinion.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",148
"149","34938. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",149
"150","—How long have you been chamberlain of Argyll ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",150
"151","—Fourteen years, but only eleven years connected with this property.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",151
"152","34939. Had you experience of property management before?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",152
"153","—Yes; I was factor for five years upon the Breadalbane estate.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",153
"154","34940. I think you stated you had no special knowledge of the Argyll estates before you came here ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",154
"155","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",155
"156","34941. But did the part of the Breadalbane estates you had charge of extend towards Oban on the west coast?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",156
"157","—No; the part I had marched with the Duke of Argyll's property near Dalmally.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",157
"158","34942. Had you some knowledge of the west of Scotland ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",158
"159","—No, I cannot say I had, beyond Dalmally.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",159
"160","34943. You have stated that you followed to a considerable extent the policy that had been laid down by Mr Campbell your predecessor ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",160
"161","—Yes, in the increase of rents put upon the farms.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",161
"162","34944. Did you consider that a wise policy ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",162
"163","—I exercised my own judgment as well.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",163
"164","34945. Have you ever heard the general opinion of the country about the policy of Mr Campbell ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",164
"165","—No, I have heard very little about him; in fact, I avoided inquiring about him.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",165
"166","34946. Why ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",166
"167","—Because I thought it was mere reports not to be relied upon.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",167
"168","34947. It would appear from Sir John M'Neill's Report in 1851 and the present valuation roll that the rental of Tyree had almost doubled ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",168
"169","—I cannot speak of my own knowledge.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",169
"170","34948. But you would no doubt take it for granted that Sir John M'Neill was furnished with correct information ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",170
"171","—No doubt.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",171
"172","34949. What did the Duke of Argyll do for Tyree during those thirty years!",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",172
"173","—I have not the means of knowing; I have never seen the accounts previous to my own charge.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",173
"174","34950. What has he done for it in your own time for the benefit of the crofter population ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",174
"175","—He has expended considerable amounts on improvements from time to time.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",175
"176","34951. We tried to get that information yesterday, but were not able to get any ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",176
"177","—Draining, fencing, buildings.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",177
"178","34952. I am speaking of the crofters ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",178
"179","—For both classes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",179
"180","34953. What sum was laid out in draining and fencing ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",180
"181","—I could not gay that.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",181
"182","34954. But you will state generally there was something ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",182
"183","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",183
"184","34955. Have complaints reached you of the state of the people of Tyree ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",184
"185","—No, with the exception of some petitions within the last year; nothing before that.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",185
"186","34956. So far as you are aware, you consider the people have no grievances at all, and are perfectly comfortable ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",186
"187","—They appear to be; they seem to be comfortable; but that is a general question; there are particular cases. ",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",187
"188","34957. The rental has been very considerably raised in the Ross of Mull; what do you consider the chief duty of a factor or chamberlain in the discharge of his office ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",188
"189","—He has a number of duties to perform.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",189
"190","34958. You cannot name one in chief, can you?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",190
"191","—I could name a great many.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",191
"192","34959. I will suggest one. Is it or is it not the chief duty of a chamberlain or factor to raise the rents ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",192
"193","—No, it is not, independent of other considerations.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",193
"194","34960. At all events, it has been well done upon the Duke's estates within the last thirty years, that part of it?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",194
"195","—That is a matter of opinion.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",195
"196","34961. Is it not a fact?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",196
"197","—It has been done ; it is a matter of opinion whether it has been well done.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",197
"198","34962. You state that one of the reasons which you thought justified the increase of rent you put on in your own time was that the value of stock had risen so much. That is the principal ground ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",198
"199","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",199
"200","34963. Are you quite sure that this great rise you speak of in stock has occurred within the last thirty years. Has it not gone back a little further ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",200
"201","—It may.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",201
"202","34964. In answer to the Chairman, you stated that you would send a copy of the regulations now in force ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",202
"203","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",203
"204","34965. What is the date of those regulations ? Were they made by yourself ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",204
"205","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",205
"206","34966. I presume further there were older ones?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",206
"207","—I am not aware; I don't think so.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",207
"208","34967. Were there no Campbell regulations?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",208
"209","—No, not so far as I am aware.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",209
"210","34968. Are we to understand there were never any printed regulations before your time ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",210
"211","—Not on this estate, so far as I am aware.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",211
"212","34969. But would the general rules not apply to all the estate ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",212
"213","—Decidedly not; there are different estates and conditions applied to them specially. There are regulations for Roseneath, Inveraray, and this estate of Mull, including Iona.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",213
"214","34970. Are there ones for Tyree?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",214
"215","—There will be, I expect, soon; they are in course of preparation.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",215
"216","34971. There being no printed regulations and no leases, how did the people know under what regulations they stood ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",216
"217","—I don't know.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",217
"218","34972. Probably you saw it was rather a hardship that the people did not know under what rule they were ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",218
"219","—I thought it desirable that there ought to be regulations.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",219
"220","34973. There were regulations on the Breadalbane estate?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",220
"221","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",221
"222","34974. Without having definite parish regulations, would it not be perfectly competent for people in an inferior position, like ground officers or others, to make statements with regard to the regulations of the estate that never existed ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",222
"223","—I don't think so; I think it is very improbable a ground officer would take upon himself to say that.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",223
"224","34975. Will you go this length, that the absence of any such rules might give rise to suspicions on the part of the people, and idle stories that things were, that did not exist?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",224
"225","—There is no reason that they should; the people will manufacture those things of course.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",225
"226","34976. There are three widows at this moment, you say, in Mull, and thirty-six in Tyree ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",226
"227","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",227
"228","34977. With regard to those thirty-six in Tyree or three in Mull are you able to state whether they have not sons of legal age ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",228
"229","—I could not state the information about the whole of them.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",229
"230","34978. Is there not a rumour about widows that they will be turned their children are young ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",230
"231","—It is quite an untrue rumour if there is; there is no such rule.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",231
"232","34979. Has there been any distinction in the treatment of widows who may have sons twenty-one years of age and widows who have no sons of that age?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",232
"233","—In any case of that kind that arises the Duke uses his own discretion; he considers each case separately.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",233
"234","34980. About the case of the widow M'Phail, who has been referred to, why was she put out?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",234
"235","—All the answer I can give is that the Duke informed himself of all the circumstances connected with the case, and he came to the decision himself after considering the circumstances carefully.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",235
"236","34981. Did any one here by your authority go to that woman to persuade her to go out voluntarily ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",236
"237","—Decidedly not. The ground officer took an ordinary letter of removal to her to sign, and asked her if she",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",237
"238","was willing to sign it, and she said she was willing.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",238
"239","34982. Was any inducement given to her to sign it?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",239
"240","—None whatever.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",240
"241","34983. What has the estate done for that widow ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",241
"242","—She is in pretty independent circumstances. I believe the proceeds of her sale amounted to more than £200. Besides that, the Duke has given her compensation for anything done to the buildings. She has a small shop of her own in the village here.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",242
"243","34984. Who gets the benefit of the crop ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",243
"244","—She does.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",244
"245","34985. There is another person who has made a complaint, named Margaret M'Arthur?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",245
"246","—For the young girl's own sake, I would rather not go into the case. If you choose I will explain.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",246
"247","34986. You state her case is one that has been duly considered?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",247
"248","—Yes, the Duke decided upon removing her—indeed, she was not removed. It remains with the tenant on the farm, and I think he has continued her.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",248
"249","34987. But you state the circumstances are such as made it proper that she should be removed ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",249
"250","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",250
"251","34988. The Chairman.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",251
"252","—You are to understand that we received a letter from this person ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",252
"253","—I am aware; but I think it better for the girl herself not to go into the case.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",253
"254","34989. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",254
"255","—I must again put the question to you. The population upon the two estates we have to do with of the Duke of Argyll are decreasing very much; the people say themselves they are getting poorer and poorer; what is going to be the result? Are you satisfied with the state of matters ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",255
"256","—I don't think poverty is increasing except in a bad year.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",256
"257","34990. Don't you think the people are telling the truth?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",257
"258","—I am sure they would tell the truth. I can only speak as a matter of opinion.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",258
"259","34991. And you don't wish to give any opinion as to the propriety of recurring to the former matters, and giving to the people larger holdings than they have at present ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",259
"260","—The crofters on this property had not larger holdings, neither had they any better, with one or two exceptions.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",260
"261","34992. I am afraid, if you will look into matters, you will find there have been a great number of removals ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",261
"262","—I speak of the crofters. I think they have the same possessions as they had before, except on Creich.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",262
"263","34993. But not the same as their predecessors had?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",263
"264","—Yes, there were more crofters before.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",264
"265","34994. In your opinion, then, the people practically have no grievance ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",265
"266","—I do not say that; it is hardly a fail- question to put to me.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",266
"267","34995. What I should like to know is what you, having the great authority you have under the Duke of Argyll, propose doing; and you cannot suppose all those people come to us with idle grievances, do you ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",267
"268","—I am afraid some of them are not well founded. ",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",268
"269","34996. But surely you would admit there is a residuum —a grain of truth—at the bottom of their grievances?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",269
"270","—-I am not prepared to admit that.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",270
"271","34997. Professor Mackinnon.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",271
"272","—You gave us the rent in 1853; you heard the crofters state the rents were raised in 1850. I suppose you have no idea what increase was made upon the rents then ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",272
"273","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",273
"274","34998. All the removals that have been spoken to were made at that time or before it ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",274
"275","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",275
"276","34999. And I rather think since that time, with respect to the crofting area, the crofts were as a rule made larger ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",276
"277","—I think very likely they were.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",277
"278","35000. Of course, the number of crofters has decreased ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",278
"279","—Yes, they have decreased.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",279
"280","35001. We find that there is a very large number of people on all the townships without land at all; are there any such people upon the big farms ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",280
"281","—Some of them are upon the big farms.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",281
"282","35002. But not in the same proportion as thev are upon the crofts?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",282
"283","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",283
"284","35003. The rent, I find, payable by the big farms, is about two-thirds of the rent of the estate. You would not say there are two-thirds of the cottars upon the estate upon those farms ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",284
"285","—No, I don't suppose there are.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",285
"286","35004. How does it happen that those poor people without land are thrown in upon the crofter class ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",286
"287","—Although they happen to be amongst the crofters you cannot say that their houses are taken off the crofters. The crofts are rented separately without taking into consideration the cottars' houses.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",287
"288","35005. Don't you think it is a great injury to a crofting township that there should be twelve or fifteen families asking continually for the grazing of a cow, and having right to trespass continually ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",288
"289","—No doubt, cottars are a great nuisance to the crofters.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",289
"290","35006. And in all the clearings made before 1850, has it not been the case that those who got no land, and were not removed, were thrown upon the crofters and not the farmers ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",290
"291","—I cannot speak to that. I don't know what was done in 1850.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",291
"292","35007. You heard to-day the people themselves stating it ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",292
"293","—Well, I suppose they may speak correctly. There are a number of cottars, no doubt.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",293
"294","35008. And mainly among the crofters ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",294
"295","—Yes, I should think so.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",295
"296","35009. There was one man before us who stated that his rent was doubled within nine years; I suppose the last rise only was in your time ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",296
"297","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",297
"298","35010. I forget whether you mentioned who made the valuation when the last rise was put upon the crofters ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",298
"299","—I got certain materials to make it, and the whole thing was submitted to the Duke, and it was he who decided.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",299
"300","35011. There were no independent men consulted ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",300
"301","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",301
"302","35012. Or whose judgment was asked in any way?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",302
"303","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",303
"304","35013. Is there great competition for a croft when it is vacant?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",304
"305","—Considerable.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",305
"306","35014. So that in fact, supposing the rent was made larger, the crofts would still be taken ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",306
"307","—I believe so.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",307
"308","35015. As matter of fact, there is none of them ever vacant ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",308
"309","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",309
"310","35016. Of the big crofts ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",310
"311","—Yes. There have been some vacant neighbourhood within the last two or three years, and taken up at an increased rent.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",311
"312","35017. Do any remain long vacant?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",312
"313","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",313
"314","35018. So that although in the case of a big farm it is a question whether you can get a tenant, in the case of crofts, you know you can get a tenant whatever rent you may put on ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",314
"315","—Oh, no, not whatever rent you put on ; so long as it is a fair rent.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",315
"316","35019. I am afraid those crofters do not consider their present rent a fair rent?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",316
"317","—Why do you get plenty of tenants to work it and make their living by it ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",317
"318","35020. Anyhow, you will get any number of applications for any croft that is vacant ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",318
"319","—Yes, within the district.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",319
"320","35021. In that case, whether the rent is unfair or fair, the croft will not be vacant ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",320
"321","—No, if they see the rent is fair. I am not prepared to admit any rent is unfair.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",321
"322","35022. But even supposing it was unfair, it would let ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",322
"323","—No, I am certain it would not.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",323
"324","35023. Has the competition not continued after the rise in 1876?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",324
"325","—Yes, it is owing to the advance of the price of cattle and sheep.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",325
"326","35024. You would not say there was a great advance before 1876 ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",326
"327","—It has continued still, and I suppose no person ever saw prices so high as they are now.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",327
"328","35025. The rent was raised 30 or 40 per cent, in that year, and the competition remained quite as keen ; would not that imply that though the rents were raised a little more the competition would continue ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",328
"329","—Not unless there was a rise of prices to justify it.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",329
"330","35026. You think you hit the line beyond which competition would not continue ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",330
"331","—I am not prepared to say.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",331
"332","35027. Is there an old regulation that the outgoing tenant leaves a portion of the crops to the succeeding tenant ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",332
"333","—Decidedly there is.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",333
"334","35028. Does that apply when the outgoing tenant holds no land?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",334
"335","—Oh yes ; it is all the same.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",335
"336","35029. And has it always been the same ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",336
"337","—Yes, since those regulations I have referred to have been in force.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",337
"338","35030. How long have they been in force ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",338
"339","—Since 1876.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",339
"340","35031. Do you know the custom upon the estate before that time?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",340
"341","—I do not.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",341
"342","35032. The outgoing tenant leaves a portion of the crop to the incoming tenant whether he himself goes to another croft or not ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",342
"343","—There is no condition of that sort at all; it is the outgoing tenant who leaves a certain thing. I can read the clause.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",343
"344","35033. What fraction of the crops does he leave ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",344
"345","—All the growing grain, rye-grass, hay, and green crops, from the outgoing tenant.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",345
"346","35031. What fraction does the outgoing tenant leave to the incoming tenant?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",346
"347","—All the growing grain, rye-grass, hay, and green crops.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",347
"348","35035. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",348
"349","—Is that a Whitsunday entry ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",349
"350","—Yes. The outgoing tenant is bound to give them at a valuation.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",350
"351","35036. Professor Mackinnon.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",351
"352","—The outgoing tenant is compelled to give over the crops at a valuation ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",352
"353","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",353
"354","35037. Is that the case upon the large farms, and upon the small farms as well ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",354
"355","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",355
"356","35038. Do you know what the practice was before that regulation was enforced upon this and similar estates in this quarter?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",356
"357","—I cannot speak as to that.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",357
"358","35039. Was it not the rule formerly that the outgoing tenant kept the crop ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",358
"359","—So it is now.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",359
"360","35040. He is bound to give it to his successor at a valuation ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",360
"361","—He gets the price of it.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",361
"362","35041. Was it not the rule formerly that he had it himself?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",362
"363","—I don't know; but I know the rule upon all properly managed properties is that the incoming tenant gets the crop at a valuation.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",363
"364","35042. When you framed the rule you did not inquire what the condition was upon which the sitting tenants held the croft ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",364
"365","—Possibly I might.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",365
"366","35043. At the present time, anyhow, they are bound to give over the crop at a valuation ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",366
"367","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",367
"368","35044. When is the valuation made?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",368
"369","—That is stipulated also.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",369
"370","35045. With respect to those crofters, is it part of the policy of the estate or the wish of the crofters themselves to be without a lease ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",370
"371","—I never asked them.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",371
"372","35046. They never asked for a lease ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",372
"373","—No, I am not aware that a single one has asked it.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",373
"374","35047. But supposing they asked it ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",374
"375","—I should represent the case to the Duke and take his instructions.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",375
"376","35048. You do not consider you would have authority to grant leases ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",376
"377","—Decidedly not; I cannot sign a lease.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",377
"378","35049. And it has not been the rule of the estate to give them ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",378
"379","—They have never been asked.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",379
"380","35050. Of course, you heard them state to-day that they would not take them at the present rents ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",380
"381","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",381
"382","35051. But that they would be glad to get them if the rents were less ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",382
"383","—Yes, I heard that also.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",383
"384","35052. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",384
"385","—Is there any fixed interval between the periods when rents are raised ? Do you revalue the crofts at fixed",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",385
"386","periods of nineteen or twenty-one years?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",386
"387","—The last time the crofters signed the general conditions of lease there was a minute at the end in",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",387
"388","which the Duke engaged not to have any revaluation of rents for ten years.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",388
"389","35053. When did they sign this minute of lease?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",389
"390","—In 1876.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",390
"391","35054. Their rents were fixed then for ten years ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",391
"392","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",392
"393","35055. How long had they been fixed before that?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",393
"394","—I cannot say, unless in 1850.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",394
"395","35056. Is there any tendency among the crofters here to subdivide their crofts among their children ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",395
"396","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",396
"397","35057. Do any of their children marry and settle upon the crofts ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",397
"398","—No, they go out of the country.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",398
"399","35058. Then those cottars are not children of old tenants ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",399
"400","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",400
"401","35059. They are people who formerly lost their crofts ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",401
"402","—I suppose so; I don't know.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",402
"403","35060. The Chairman.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",403
"404","—I ought perhaps to have asked you to make remarks at the beginning, but will you be good enough to do so now ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",404
"405","—At Tyree yesterday Donald Macdonald, Balphuil, referred to letters sent from the Duke from Campbeltown. These were merely notices from the county assessor of an alteration of the rental. He also stated that no crofters in the island have any sheep. One township in Tyree has a regular summing of sheep, and a great many crofters have a few sheep on their crofts, and others let their wintering —bring in sheep to winter.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",405
"406","John Campbell, Ballinoe, made a statement about the croft added to Balphuil farm four years ago. That croft was added —or rather he got a change of croft at his own express wish, and the croft was added to Hillipool farm, to which it lies—it is rather an ugly boundary there—by the Duke's special directions. ",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",406
"407","Allan M'Innes, Creich, was asked to-day if he was tenant of the croft and he answered he was not, it was",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",407
"408","his brother's name that was in the rental. Before any change was made they were both asked. In fact it came partly from himself that the change should be made.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",408
"409","35061. We stated as much?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",409
"410","—The increase of rent which was made on the crofters in the Ross of Mull in 1876 was apportioned in the different townships by the crofters themselves; that is the answer I have to give for Lachlan Macdonald, who said his rent was doubled.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",410
"411","35062. Professor Mackinnon.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",411
"412","—The total amount of the increase was told to them ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",412
"413","—Yes, and they appointed parties amongst themselves to apportion that.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",413
"414","35063. But they did not fix the amount put upon them ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",414
"415","—I do not say that. That accounts for some of the rents being raised more than others; it was their own doing. John M'Cormack, Catchean, said there was no individual grazing attached to their crofts. There is individual grazing to almost every croft besides the common grazing. The statement that witness also made as to being compelled to let their wintering is not correct. I am not aware of ever having spoken to them",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",415
"416","about their wintering.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",416
"417","35064. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",417
"418","—Your predecessor did so ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",418
"419","—But I am not aware of any compulsion.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",419
"420","35065. Professor Mackinnon.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",420
"421","—He said there was no compulsion unless the necessity for getting money.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",421
"422","—I think he also mentioned about some hogg wintering Mr Campbell had let himself for the stock of a nephew, and that he applied to me about it. I have no recollection of it. If he had I should have referred it to Mr Campbell's trustees; it was before my time.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",422
"423","35066. The Chairman ",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",423
"424","—As you nave referred to Tyree, there are one or two points I would like to ask you about. We had a statement made to us about the Sea-weed Company and the system under which they pursue their traffic, both in reference to the payment of wages and the payment for commodities received, and the payment of things that they buy. The general complaint over all was that they paid in kind, and kept a running account with their customers and rarely ever paid in money. In fact, it seemed to us to be the truck system in full vigour. What do you know about it?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",424
"425","—I know little about it except that I believe it exists, and I certainly do not approve of it.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",425
"426","35067. On the whole, you do not approve of it ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",426
"427","—Still, it is the rule in almost every work of the kind, even quarries. You will find it over any part of Scotland I am acquainted with.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",427
"428","35068. We heard that this system had obtained at the quarry here, but had been abandoned ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",428
"429","—I suppose it is hardly worth while keeping it up now for the number of people they employ. I don't know what the reason is for having given it up, but I fancy it is that.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",429
"430","35069. We have heard a good deal about the truck system in the north, but we found in Orkney and Shetland a general impression that it was being dissolved, and people were far more contented, especially among the fishing population. Has the truck system with this company in Tyree grown up and been practised with the knowledge and approval of the proprietor ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",430
"431","—Oh, yes; his knowledge at any rate.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",431
"432","35070. Is the company paying rent to the Duke of Argyll ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",432
"433","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",433
"434","35071. For buildings, land, and the privileges of the shore?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",434
"435","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",435
"436","35072. Was there any provision made in the lease with reference to the manner in which wages should be paid ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",436
"437","—None whatever.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",437
"438","35073. Has the lease long to run ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",438
"439","—There was a new lease entered into in 1882 to 1887. ",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",439
"440","35074. Had any complaints been made of the truck system previous to the lease being signed ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",440
"441","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",441
"442","35075. It is not a new subject of consideration which has sprung up recently ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",442
"443","—Yes ",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",443
"444","35076. Are you aware that the company were in the habit of buying small commodities from the people in the country, such as eggs ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",444
"445","—I was not aware.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",445
"446","35077. You are not aware that they buy anything from their labouring people ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",446
"447","—I am not aware.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",447
"448","35078. We asked them that question, and they told us they did buy some things, and mentioned eggs; and I asked whether they paid for those small commodities in money or in goods, and they said in goods, or they took them on account. You are not aware of any traffic of that sort the company carried on?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",448
"449","—No, but it is quite possible. It is quite a traffic entered into by shopkeepers and storekeepers in Tyree",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",449
"450","35079. It is the custom of the country?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",450
"451","—Quite.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",451
"452","35080. Are money payments very rare in that sort of small traffic between a small tenant or labourer and the shop with which he deals ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",452
"453","—Oh, no ; it is usually money payments.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",453
"454","35081. That is to say, if a labourer carries his eggs to the shop he is generally paid in ready money ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",454
"455","—I should say generally in kind in that  case. A great many people go to a shop who have no eggs.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",455
"456","35082. We were told that if the people insisted upon being paid in money they got a lower price for their labour or 'goods ; but if they consented to take payment in goods they got a higher price: were you aware",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",456
"457","of that ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",457
"458","—No; I cannot speak as to that.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",458
"459","35083. In speaking of the rise in rent on the larger description of farms on the estate, you said that the proportionate increase had been the same; but, with reference to the larger farms, do you get the rents —I mean has the proprietor to make reductions, occasionally remitting portions of the rents, or have they been well paid up ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",459
"460","—They are well paid up.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",460
"461","35084. Supposing the large farms, as they may be called, were at this moment vacant, woidd you have any difficulty in getting the same rents ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",461
"462","—I think not; prices are very high at present.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",462
"463","35085. You think you would get a tenant to take the farms at the same rent as those who are now sitting ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",463
"464","—I have no reason to think otherwise.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",464
"465","35086. We heard something about the distribution of money or seed obtained from public charity in Tyree; was there an application from Tyree for assistance from the outside ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",465
"466","—There was, from some of the crofters.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",466
"467","35087. Through whom was this application conveyed to Mr M'Dairmid the sub-factor?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",467
"468","—It was laid before the Duke, and approved of by him.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",468
"469","35088. What was the distress in Tyree founded upon ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",469
"470","—The bad season and the failure of the potatoes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",470
"471","35089. What amount was got for the relief of the people in Tyree from sources of public charity?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",471
"472","—£115; I think that was entirely for cottars, and was given in money and meal.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",472
"473","35090. It was procured from public subscription for the relief of poverty in Tyree ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",473
"474","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",474
"475","35091. And has been distributed ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",475
"476","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",476
"477","35092. Not among the rent-paying class ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",477
"478","—No ; amongst cottars.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",478
"479","35093. Do the persons who have been in receipt of this description of charity in any case pay rents to the proprietor ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",479
"480","—No.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",480
"481","35094. Are they in receipt of parochial assistance ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",481
"482","—Not generally.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",482
"483","35095. They are persons paying no rent and receiving no parochial assistance ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",483
"484","—Persons in poor circumstances.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",484
"485","35096. Has any distribution of public charity taken place on this estate ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",485
"486","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",486
"487","35097. How was that applied for?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",487
"488","—It was partly applied for direct, and partly sent through me.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",488
"489","35098. From what fund was it taken ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",489
"490","—Partly from the Glasgow fund and partly from the Mansion House fund.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",490
"491","35099. How much has been obtained for the relief of this estate ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",491
"492","—I really could not say; there was £50 sent through me from the Mansion House fund.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",492
"493","35100. Any more ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",493
"494","—Several sums besides.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",494
"495","35101. Do you think more than £100 has been distributed?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",495
"496","—No, I don't think so ; possibly less than that.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",496
"497","35102. By whom has this money been distributed—was it by a committee?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",497
"498","—Yes.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",498
"499","35103. Who were the members of the committee?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",499
"500","—The parish minister ; Mr Campbell, the ground officer; Mr M'Quarie, and the inspector of poor.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",500
"501","35104. In that case the ground officer was a member of the committee for the distribution of public charity among persons living upon the proprietor's estate ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",501
"502","—Cottars.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",502
"503","35105. Was any of this money given to any class of persons paying rent ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",503

"505","35106. Nobody has received money through public charity who is paying rent ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",505

"507","35107. But has any public charity been given to persons paying rent of any class ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",507
"508","—A few cottars who pay rent received assistance, but all cottars—any one in destitute circumstances.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",508
"509","35108. Does that apply both to Tyree and here; have persons there paying rent received any ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",509
"510","—None there.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",510
"511","35109. Did any on this estate?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",511
"512","—There may have been a few, but the general rule was not.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",512
"513","35110. Sheriff Nicolson.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",513
"514","—In valuing a farm or farms for the purpose of raising or lowering the rent, if the latter is ever done, what principle do you go upon—what means do you take for estimating at what rate the increase should be made ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",514
"515","—There are several ways of valuing a farm ; either putting so much per acre upon it, or valuing it by the stocking.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",515
"516","35111. In the valuation which was made in 1876, was it the increase in the price of stock that was taken into consideration in raising the rents of the farms?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",516
"517","—That was the principal reason, as I have mentioned already—the increase in the value of sheep and cattle.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",517
"518","35112. In valuing a township on which there is a number of crofters, how is the valuation made ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",518
"519","—Either by valuing the land at so much the acre or valuing the stocking.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",519
"520","35113. But it must be either the one or the other?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",520
"521","—It can be both; I generally do both, to check myself.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",521
"522","35114. But do you apportion the increase to each individual crofter, instead of leaving it to themselves ? The calculation must be made for the stock which each particular man holds : ought not the increase, if it be a proper one, to be put upon each croft ? ",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",522
"523","—All hold the same proportion of stock, or ought to; sometimes the arable land of one is a little better than that of others; and I consider, if they agree to it themselves, it is the best way to allow them to apportion it if they are satisfied to do so.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",523
"524","35115. Are they quite satisfied with the apportionment made amongst themselves ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",524
"525","—I never heard of any complaint at the time.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",525
"526","35116. Have they any form or constitution among themselves for uniting and considering their common affairs? Have they a constable in the village, a man who represents the township ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",526
"527","—The usual way is, they appoint themselves one or two managers for the year. That is the proper way to do.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",527
"528","35117. Is that the case in most of the places?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",528
"529","—It ought to be, and I believe it is.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",529
"530","35118. Mr Cameron.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",530
"531","—Are the large farms sheep farms?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",531
"532","—Some sheep and cattle.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",532
"533","35119. You would have more difficulty in letting a sheep farm just now ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",533
"534","—I should think so; because it is a very heavy matter to go into a sheep stock just now, considering the prices of sheep.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",534
"535","35120. What is the highest rental ?",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",535
"536","—£700; that is a sheep farm entirely.",579,"James Wyllie","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",536
