"1","DAVID PETRIE, Crofter and Fisherman, Gossaburgh, Mid Yell (54)—examined.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",1
"2","19617. The Chairman.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",2
"3","—Have you any statement to make about the condition of the people?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",3
"4","—Yes.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",4
"5","19618. Please to do so?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",5
"6","—The first thing we want is a fair valuation by Government of the lands we are occupying, because we have heavy rents and very little surface; and besides, we want houses we can live in. Our houses are 28 feet long by 12 feet wide, and 6 feet high in the walls, and are built like a dry stone dyke. There is some mortar heaved into them when they are being built; that is all. If they are built with lime, we have to be at the expense of it. Then they have a turf roof, not fit for a human being to live under.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",6
"7","19619. What sort of houses do you wish to get?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",7
"8","—We want them to be built with lime, so as to make them sufficient and comfortable to live in. We cannot live comfortably in them just now; on a windy night in winter we are blown from the fireside almost. As for myself, I have no proprietor to apply to; there is a factor who takes up the rent, but ho does not know who the property belongs to.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",8
"9","19620. How is that?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",9
"10","—Because it is a disputed property.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",10
"11","19621. What sort of roof do you want?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",11
"12","—I would like a house with two comfortable rooms and a felt roof.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",12
"13","19622. We have heard a great deal about felt roofs, we don't think felt roots are good in the south of Scotland; do you think the people here have had sufficient experience of the durability of felt roofs?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",13
"14","—I think they have had experience of them for a few years.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",14
"15","19623. Do they not require to be tarred every year?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",15
"16","—They do.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",16
"17","19624. And if they are tarred every year, how long do you think they will last?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",17
"18","—A long time, I think. A thatch roof is a great deal of trouble, and the wind often like to carry them away.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",18
"19","19625. What do you generally use for thatch here?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",19
"20","—All straw.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",20
"21","19626. You want a valuation of your land and good houses: what do you want next?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",21
"22","—We just want to have a fair valuation of our lots; we can say nothing against the scathold, we have it at our freedom; there are no railings where I live.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",22
"23","19627. Do you want to have fences?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",23
"24","—No, they are of no good that I see to us.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",24
"25","19628. What else?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",25
"26","—That is just what I am stating to you.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",26
"27","19629. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",27
"28","—Do you complain of the rent?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",28
"29","—Yes, because there was £1 laid on me, and then they came and took away so much of my inside property off me, and I got no reduction.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",29
"30","19630. The inside property?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",30
"31","—Yes, the arable land.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",31
"32","19631. The Chairman.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",32
"33","—When did they do that?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",33
"34","—When the property was allotted.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",34
"35","19632. Was it given to the proprietor, or to another crofter?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",35
"36","—It was given to another crofter when the land was allotted. The land was in rigs, and then it was allotted, and they had to strike a straight line.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",36
"37","19633. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",37
"38","—Did you not get another piece?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",38
"39","—A small piece on one side, but none on the other.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",39
"40","19634. Professor Mackinnon.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",40
"41","—You lost more than you got?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",41
"42","—Yes, and they raised the rent £1 just the year before.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",42
"43","19635. The Chairman.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",43
"44","—Was that to benefit the occupiers that the land was allotted?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",44
"45","—Mine was a lot before, but not on the other side.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",45
"46","19636. But generally speaking, is it a good thing that the land should be allotted and divided?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",46
"47","—I don't think it was, because some of them had to travel a long way to their land.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",47
"48","19637. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",48
"49","—What is the cost of a good house in Shetland?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",49
"50","—The houses formerly built in Shetland only cost about £5 or £6.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",50
"51","19638. But these would not satisfy you now?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",51
"52","—No.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",52
"53","19639. What would be the cost of a better kind of house?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",53
"54","—I could not exactly say; I am only wanting my house repaired and remedied; that is all I want.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",54
"55","19640. The Chairman.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",55
"56","—The existing wall would do?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",56
"57","—I got lime for my house two years back, and took it out of the vessel: but it cannot go on unless I do it myself, and it would take a man a fortnight to do it. The house has stood for fifty years.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",57
"58","19641. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",58
"59","—What is your rent?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",59

"65","—None.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",65
"66","19644. Sheep?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",66
"67","—About thirty; they are in the scathold.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",67
"68","19615. You don't pay anything additional for the sheep?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",68
"69","—No.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",69
"70","19646. It is all in the £5, 10s.?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",70
"71","—Yes.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",71
"72","19647. How many sheep do you count as equivalent to one cow?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",72
"73","—I suppose about ten.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",73
"74","19648. How many of your cattle are young?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",74
"75","—I have two cows and four young ones.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",75
"76","19649. If you had a good house, and were satisfied that you would not be turned out, would you consider your rent too high?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",76
"77","—I consider it is too high, because they made off with my property. I only paid £4, 10s. formerly.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",77
"78","19650. But as things improve, you get higher prices for your produce?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",78
"79","—It is only a few years we have had that; we must just take the times as they come; and that might not come for a long time again.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",79
"80","19651. If you had to fix your own rent, what would you fix it at?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",80
"81","—£4, 10s.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",81
"82","19652. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",82
"83","—And you would have a good house?",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",83
"84","—Yes. I have seen the cattle sold at £2 and 30s.",349,"David Petrie","Mid Yell, Raefirth",84
