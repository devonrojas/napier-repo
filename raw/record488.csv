"17","—' To the Royal Commissioners. My Lord and Gentlemen.",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",17
"18","We are under the necessity of bringing under your notice that the rents of our crofts are by far too high j this is chiefly because some of our low land and best hills we had were taken from us, and attached to large sheep farms, and no reduction of rent. All this was done by evil and senseless factors, who had too much influence under our late proprietor. These three tremendous factors—one a retired merchant, one an officer in the army, and the other a great terror for putting away poor people—these inebriate three caused our estate to be in arrears, also in heavy debt to merchants; therefore what would clear us from this debt is to get improvements on our lots, and the land in the old way in which the old wise men had put it out for us ; also to get harbours on our rough shores to save our lives and increase our fishings. We have nothing against our present proprietor, P. L. Bankes, Esq., of Letterewe and Gruinard, he acted very kindly in sympathy and lenity in providing us with potatoes, oats seed, and meal, &c. ",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",18
"19","First Coast Township;",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",19
"20","—The best of our hill and low land was taken from us, the low land was let to a new tenant. Whenever we heard it we at once assembled and prevented the man taking possession, afterwards we were compelled to pay the appointed rent in addition to our old rent, which we consented to in fear we would be put away. ",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",20
"21","Second Coast Township:",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",21
"22","—Our best hills, even some of our peats and some of our low ground pasture, were taken from us, after we ourselves offered the same rent for it as the man to whom it was let. ",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",22
"23","Third Sand Township:",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",23
"24","—The best of our hills and a good deal of our green pasture were taken from us. This green pasture we had for our milk cows, upon which we depend a great deal for part of our living, and the hills we had for summering our horses, cattle, and sheep, such as Ben Chasqun. All the Gruinard estate had the use of Ben Chasqun.",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",24

"33","28941. Did he raise the rents before he sold the estate?",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",33
"34","—No. The place was lotted out in Mr Davidson's time, and the rents that were very high were placed upon others —some more than others. My own lot was rented at £8, and afterwards I found the rent was too high, and they took £2 worth off the lot and put it on to another man, and charged me £6.",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",34
"35","28942. Did Mr Bankes make any changes when he came ?",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",35

"41","28945. Was all the land which was taken away given to the tenants, or was it used in part for deer forests ?",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",41

"45","28947. When the hill pasture was taken away from you what reduction was made iu your rent ?",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",45
"46","—Not a penny. I believe that £ 7 was added to the rent of the place, but not a penny was taken off.",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",46

"53","28951. And the factor you have now?",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",53
"54","—We have had no factor since the present proprietor came into possession.",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",54
"55","28952. Does the present proprietor show any inclination to make your state better ?",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",55
"56","—We don't know, but our belief is that if he could our condition would not be worse than it is.",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",56

"66","28957. You complain that peats have been taken from you, are you obliged to pay for the peats which you formerly had free?",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",66
"67","—There are some who pay for the old ground which was taken from us. When that ground was taken from us we had to come on to our own land to cut peats, for they are scarce and far away.",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",67
"68","28958. How much will it cost a family for peats for the year?",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",68

"77","28962. Who has the grazing which was taken from you?",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",77

"87","28967. How may people were cleared out of what now goes under the name of Drumchork.",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",87
"88","—I don't know about the number of families that were in Drumchork, but there was a place adjacent to myself out of which the people were cleared and scattered throughout the whole earth, and the people of Dingwall came and pounded them upon the stones; and the meal that was being prepared for the family was taken away off the fire, and thrown outside.",488,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",88
