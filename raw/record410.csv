"1","Rev. DAVID JOHNSTON, Minister of Harray and Birsay (47)—examined.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",1
"2","24013. The Chairman.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",2
"3","—How long have you been settled here""?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",3
"4","—Since 1868.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",4
"5","24014. We may say fifteen years?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",5
"6","—Yes.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",6
"7","24015. Does your family belong to these islands?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",7
"8","—No, I belong to the south.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",8
"9","24016. To Dumfriesshire?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",9
"10","—I am a native of Durham, but my father belonged to Fifeshire.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",10
"11","24017. During the period that you have lived here you have had many opportunities of making yourself acquainted with the condition of different classes—you have the great peculiarity here, that you are minister of a parish which is almost entirely composed of small lairds and freeholders?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",11
"12","—That is so.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",12
"13","24018. Do you consider that is a happy and favourable condition of life?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",13
"14","—Decidedly.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",14
"15","24019. Do you consider that these small proprietors possess a greater share of satisfaction and welfare, in consequence of their being proprietors of their own lands?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",15
"16","—I do think so.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",16
"17","24020. You think that has a good effect upon their morals and intelligence?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",17
"18","—To a great extent it has.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",18
"19","24021. Does the possession of land, and freedom from the payment of rent, tend to make them careless and indifferent in their cultivation, or does it tend to stimulate their industry?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",19
"20","—To stimulate their industry. I saw a different state of matters in Unst. I was minister there for two or three years before I came here, and I contrasted the state of things in Harray and Unst.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",20
"21","24022. Do you think the superiority of the condition of the people of  Harray may be referred in a considerable measure to the fact that the people are proprietors; or does it depend upon the difference of climate and soil— physical circumstances?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",21
"22","—To a great extent to their being proprietors, I should say; there is very little poverty. There is no resident pauper in Harray, and there would be no pauper at all, if it were not that one is south, at the asylum.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",22
"23","24023. You think they are proud of being proprietors'?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",23
"24","—Yes, an honourable pride.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",24
"25","24024. And that they are strongly attached to the soil and their own properties?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",25
"26","—Yes.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",26
"27","24025. During the last fifteen years have you seen a great improvement in the condition of the houses and the cultivation of the fields ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",27
"28","—A great improvement in the houses, and I believe if we were to go back beyond fifteen years—say thirty years—we would observe a very decided improvement in the cultivation also; and the roads have largely contributed to it.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",28
"29","24026. Docs this class of proprietors intermarry with each other, generally, or do they seek their wives outside, from other places and other classes?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",29
"30","—They intermarry very much.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",30
"31","24027. So that it constitutes a separate self-contained community?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",31
"32","—There are many marriages in neighbouring parishes, because there are small proprietorships there, though not to the same extent —in Sandwick, Birsay, Stennis, and the neighbouring parishes.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",32
"33","24028. But they intermarry in their own order?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",33
"34","—Yes.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",34
"35","24029. Have you made any study of the origin of these families—have you any reason to know that some of them are extremely ancient in their holdings ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",35
"36","—I believe there are a few udal tenures; but within the memory of the oldest inhabitants there has been a very extensive subdivision of the properties. There are persons living now who can remember when a large part of the parish was held by perhaps two or three, and these properties have been subdivided; perhaps one property may have been divided into six, or one property may have consisted of six or ten different farms, and the tenants bought them when they were for sale, or others bought them.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",36
"37","24030. The subdivision has been caused, not by distribution among",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",37
"38","children, but by purchase?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",38
"39","—Generally by purchase, and a few cases of partitioning, but not many.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",39
"40","24031. But have many proprietors who have had large families been obliged to sell to provide for their children?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",40
"41","—No, I don't think so; in general those who sold were not resident in the parish.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",41
"42","24032. You don't think that there is anything to complain of in the way of subdivision by succession?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",42
"43","—No, not as a rule. There have been cases of subdivision. I know a comparatively small property in the parish that was subdivided very much; I think as many as six or seven of a family got a portion, but that is an exception.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",43
"44","24033. But, generally speaking, do you think when there are several members of a family, that there is any arrangement between the children on account of the land being all left to one, or going to one; or do they accept it as the natural order of things that they must go out and seek their fortunes?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",44
"45","—There is not often any arrangement. It sometimes happens that even a younger member of a family stays at home, and the others, I suppose, acquiesce in it as a reasonable arrangement that the younger member should succsed, when they have been put in circumstances for getting well on in life  elsewhere. I know of some cases of, perhaps, ill-feeling from the way the land has been left, but not many. ",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",45
"46","24031. When the several members of a family go abroad to seek their fortunes, leaving one in possession of the soil, do those who go away retain an attachment to their native place, and sometimes come home or correspond with the remaining members ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",46
"47","—I could name several cases where a man has gone away for several years—perhaps gone to sea, or",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",47
"48","Australia, or some other place —and come back and purchased a property in the island.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",48
"49","24035. Do they send money back to their families sometimes ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",49
"50","—Yes, they do.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",50
"51","24036. Professor Mackinnon.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",51
"52","—Comparing this parish with that of Unst, you are decidedly of opinion that the people are very much more comfortable in this place than they were in Unst when you were there ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",52
"53","—Decidedly.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",53
"54","24037. And you attribute it in a great measure to the fact that they are in possession of their own land? —In a great measure, but of course, the land in Orkney is superior, and that has something to do with it.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",54
"55","24038. Do you think if the people of Unst had the land in their own hands, as the people of this parish have, they would be more comfortable than they were when you were there?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",55
"56","—There were a few, perhaps about twenty, similar to those here, and making allowance for the difference in climate and productiveness, they were about as comfortable as those in Harray.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",56
"57","24039. They were much more comfortable there than their neighbours, the small tenants in Unst?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",57
"58","—Of course, owing to the fact that they were proprietors, and not with reference to the way in which they manage.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",58
"59","24040. And had they in Unst the same feeling of honourable pride in being proprietors, which exists here ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",59
"60","—Yes, they enjoy the position.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",60
"61","24041. And had they the tendency to restrict themselves in their matrimonial engagements to their own order?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",61
"62","—I can scarcely speak to that.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",62
"63","24042. There were too few of them, perhaps?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",63
"64","—Yes.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",64
"65","24043. But is there such a tendency perceptible in this parish ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",65
"66","—Yes, there is in this parish.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",66
"67","24044. I suppose we understand it is not an absolute rule that they marry in their own order?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",67
"68","—No, a tenant may marry the daughter of a proprietor or conversely.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",68
"69","24015. There is a large number of very small properties in the parish of Harray ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",69
"70","—I have a list of the proprietors in Harray, and the number given is 102, but in some cases there are two or three the same. I should think, however, the different proprietors must come to somewhere about ninety at any rate, but I cannot, at this moment, tell the exact number.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",70
"71","24046. Do you think that those down on the valuation roll under, say £5, are in a better position than if they were tenants of somewhat larger holdings ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",71
"72","—Yes, I should say they are.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",72
"73","24047. What would be the value of the property where the owner of it would be as comfortable and as well off in all his ways as the tenant paying £30 ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",73
"74","—That is not a very easy thing to give an estimate of, but I could conceive that a proprietor of property worth £15 or £20 a year, would be as well off as a tenant at £30.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",74
"75","24048. The tenant would require to pay about twice as much of rent, as it were, as the rateable value of the proprietor's holding, in order to be equally comfortable ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",75
"76","—Well, perhaps, there may be a difference of from a half to a third; but I cannot guarantee that answer on that point.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",76
"77","24049. Are the people better educated than the people in your old parish of Unst ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",77
"78","—I am at a loss to say; I think in both parishes they are very well educated; I do not think there is a great difference. ",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",78
"79","24050. They are well educated in both parishes ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",79
"80","—Yes. ",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",80
"81","24051. Is the education as high under the present arrangement as it was under the old parochial school arrangement?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",81
"82","—I preferred the old school arrangement; I was not one of those who thought the Education Act was a decided advantage to the parishes, but I think the education given in the public schools is very good. I have a very decided opinion as to the drawback connected with the system of uniting parishes, where two parishes are tied together as one. I think that has greatly hindered Harray and Birsay. Each should have a School Board of its own.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",82
"83","24052. Is the education given sufficient to enable members of a family to push their way in the world elsewhere ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",83
"84","—Many have pushed their way elsewhere from that education. I believe in several instances boys or girls who have got a little advanced may go to Kirkwall or Stromness for the completion of their education. But many have got on, and got on honourably, in the south, with the education which they got in these parishes.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",84
"85","24053. But those who wish to prosecute a higher education can go to Kirkwall or Stromness to finish off?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",85
"86","—Yes.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",86
"87","24054. There are very good schools in these places ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",87
"88","—Yes.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",88
"89","24055. Especially in Kirkwall ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",89
"90","—And I believe in Stromness, too.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",90
"91","24056. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",91
"92","—Did I understand you to say that there is only one pauper from Harray on the roll ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",92
"93","—Only one, and that one is a pauper because he is in the asylum.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",93
"94","24057. From what class does that lunatic pauper come—from that of the proprietors or tenants or cottars?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",94
"95","—I think his father was a proprietor, and he has relatives who are proprietors.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",95
"96","24058. He comes from that class ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",96
"97","—Yes.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",97
"98","24059. What may be the population of the parish of Harray?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",98
"99","—Somewhere between 700 and 800, not including Birsay.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",99
"100","24060. I suppose there is no such thing in Scotland as only one pauper a parish?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",100
"101","—Certainly it is not a very common thing.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",101
"102","24061. I suppose the whole of the people don't belong to the Established Church ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",102
"103","—No.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",103
"104","24062. Is there a fair proportion?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",104
"105","—There is; I don't know the attendance elsewhere, but I think that other denominations have, on the whole, more than the parish church. But still there is a fair proportion.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",105
"106","24063. Such being the case, do you find much difficulty in the payment of your stipend—in recovering it?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",106
"107","—No, I don't at all. I find no difficulty in that respect in Harray. There may be one or two exceptions",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",107
"108","over the whole of Harray and Birsay, but I don't complain of that.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",108
"109","24064. You find no dissatisfaction or reluctance to pay the proportion of stipend money among those in Harray who are not members of your congregation?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",109
"110","—Certainly not—not in Harray.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",110
"111","24065. And you have to collect from nearly one hundred, including Birsay ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",111
"112","—I have to collect from about 150; some of them very small sums, if I chose to exact them.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",112
"113","24066. Mr Cameron.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",113
"114","—Do you know anything about the crofters in the parish of Birsay ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",114
"115","—I know some of them.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",115
"116","24067. Have you any information respecting their condition which you wish to give us ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",116
"117","—I think, as a general rule, they are very well off.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",117
"118","24068. Do you think their rents are satisfactory? have you heard any complaints about that ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",118
"119","—No, I do not hear much complaint",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",119
"120","24069. Are they a small class of crofters, or do they pay, for crofters, good rents?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",120
"121","—They vary. There are not many large farms in Birsay; Lord Zetland's farms are generally smaller farms.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",121
"122","24070. Are they what may be called medium-sized farms?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",122
"123","—I would say they are small farms. ",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",123
"124","24071. Not small crofts?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",124
"125","—No, I would not say they are called crofters; I would not call them crofters, but small farmers.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",125
"126","24072. What is the lowest rent?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",126
"127","—£6 to £ 15 or £ 20; but of course there are farms above that.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",127
"128","24073. £ 6 is about the lowest?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",128
"129","—There may be some as low as £ 3.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",129
"130","24074. In point of fact, then, there are all sizes?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",130
"131","—Yes.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",131
"132","24075. Are they tolerably comfortable well to-do people?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",132
"133","—There is more poverty than in Harray, but on the whole, they are fairly comfortable.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",133
"134","24076. Is the land equally good in Birsay as in Harray?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",134
"135","—Yes. Perhaps better in some parts; the crops are sooner ready. I had once the whole of Harray and Birsay —they were united in one parish under one minister.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",135
"136","24077. You have not that now?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",136
"137","—Not the whole of Birsay, but I had once.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",137
"138","24078. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",138
"139","—You were asked about the character of the agriculture, and you compared it with the character of the agriculture in Unst. But comparing the agriculture of the proprietors here with that of the tenant farmers in Birsay how would you say it stands? ",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",139
"140","—Much the same between here and Birsay, only there are some larger farms in Birsay than in Harray.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",140
"141","24079. On these larger farms is the agriculture of a higher order ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",141
"142","—Fully, I should say. There are the farms of Boodhouse and Swanie conducted on a higher scale than the generality of farms.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",142
"143","24080. Is the stock a better kind of stock?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",143
"144","—No, I don't think so.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",144
"145","24081. You think the proprietors in this parish have as good stock as the tenants and large farmers in the neighbouring parish?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",145
"146","—I think so.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",146
"147","24082. Stock which brings as high prices in the market?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",147
"148","—I think so, but I do not know much about that.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",148
"149","24083. Is the cultivation here as good as in the neighbouring parish of",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",149
"150","Birsay?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",150
"151","—Yes, and immensely improved within the memory of the oldest inhabitants; it was very poor before.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",151
"152","24084. The Chairman.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",152
"153","—Do you desire to make a statement about the evils attached to united parishes?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",153
"154","—I should like, if that point is within the competency of the Commission, to call attention to it. So far as I can understand, the parishes were united long ago, simply because there were not enough people in each parish to support a minister. That was a purely ecclesiastical matter, but it has brought very inconvenient civil consequences along with it. I suppose any remarks I make are not to be limited to Harray and Birsay. I could mention islands where one has quite an independent interest from another, and where it is forced into connection with the other, so that it must be under the same School Board and the same Parochial Board. I could name the island of Flotta, which is connected with the island of Walls, and which, at present, has no representative in the School Board. I believe it pays school rates to Walls, and gets no rate back; and I know of other cases in Orkney and in Shetland of the same nature, where islaud parishes are tied together in a way that is very inconvenient. I see no reason why Harray and Birsay should be tied together in the way they are; and I believe many of the people think the same thing. I have often wished to suggest in the proper quarter that it should, at any rate, be competent in the case of united parishes, where one of the parishes can show reasons for being disunited, that it should be so. For instance, a bill at the door there quotes an Act of Parliament, and the way in which the thing is done is often in the interpretation clause—in the Education Act of 1872 it is the tenth section which provides for it—which states that the word ' parish' includes united parish; and however strong a reason may be offered why an island such as Flotta or North Ronaldshay should have a separate Parochial Board or School Board, it is still bound to another. In the island of Bressay they are compelled to be in union with a part of the mainland of Shetland and with an island on the other side of the mainland of Shetland, merely because the old arrangement has been adhered to. Now, in almost every other old arrangement, when that arrangement is inconvenient, legislation provides a remedy, but it has not been so in this instance.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",154
"155","24085. There ought to be discretionary power to disunite united parishes, where their civil interests render it desirable ?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",155
"156","—Yes, perhaps by petition to the sheriff, or some other way.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",156
"157","24086. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",157
"158","—I am afraid the sheriff is not strong enough to do it. Is there not a process in the Court of Sessiou for that?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",158
"159","—Ecclesiastically, but not civilly.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",159
"160","24087. You don't mean to say that there should be half a dozen separate boards and jurisdictions in one parish. You mean to disunite and reconstitute the parish which once was a parish?",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",160
"161","—Yes, where there was sufficient reason for it; and that every Act of Parliament referring to Scotland should not tie down all future parishes in that way to be together. I am afraid it would require an Act of Parliament to disunite them—it would need legislation.",410,"Rev David Johnston","Orkney, Harray",161
