"1","WILLIAM BLACK, Crofter, Pitaxie (34), and JOHN ROSS, Crofter, Clunel, Parish of Lairg (26)—examined.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",1
"2","38813. The Chairman.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",2
"3","—You have been elected a delegate by the people of Gruids?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",3
"4","—[William Black]. I have.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",4
"5","38814. How many people took part in the election1?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",5
"6","—I did not count them, but there was a large assemblage.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",6
"7","38815. Was the paper you are about to read communicated to them after it was drawn up, and did they approve of it?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",7
"8","—Yes. 'The Crofters under the proprietorship of Lady Matheson.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",8
"9","—The grievance of the crofters of the township of Gruids is the smallness of their crofts, both arable and pasture. The overcrowding of the township is mainly due to the Clunel evictions sixty years ago to make room for sheep. The crofters had reclaimed the land, and built houses thereon at their own expense, and were paying rent to the amount of £ 84 annually, being a higher rent than ever paid since. When in our present factor's possession he had it for £ 30 a year. This certainly wounded the feelings of the evicted crofters and their descendants, to see the land from which they were ruthlessly driven in possession of the factor for less rent. Twenty-six years ago miles of pasture were taken off the crofters without any reduction of rent being given, as well as depriving them of the work done on the estate, which made their grievances twofold. The factor's practice was to send men from Dornoch to do all the work, while all the men of Gruids were allowed to go idle; still their rents would require to be paid, otherwise they would be threatened with eviction, or their effects poinded. We have neither lease nor valuation given us, or encouragement of any kind. We have to pay for the smallest piece of wood we require for houses, fences, &c. The crofts we occupy will hardly keep meal to each of us for six months, and for most no work on the estate to assist us for the remainder of the year. The first evictions carried into effect on this estate commenced about seventy years ago. Some of the evicted got crofts in Clunel, from which they were again evicted in the course of twelve years to the township of Gruids, others having to leave for foreign countries; and a third eviction was attempted on the township of Gruids. The above evictions were cruelly brought about. The people were forced out of their houses by a military force, and had to take to the hills. Old men and children were nearly starved in snow on their return. After the departure of the soldiers, they found that they had no houses to shelter them for the night, besides taking some, that turned back to save their effects, prisoners. The land from which those crofters were evicted amounts to about one thousand acres, for which the tacksman pays about sixpence an acre on an average, with hill pasture; while we pay 2s. 8d. an acre for ours, which is of very inferior quality, and all improved at our own expense. We are informed that there is a law in our country to protect us, but when such oppression as described in the above is in force we find no protection whatsoever from the present law. Therefore we earnestly advocate a thorough reform of the land laws. In advance of the Royal Commission, we had our winter stock taken up by the ground officer, which could not be done with justice to us, as we have to buy yearly for our winterstock. Second, we had a one-sided valuation in the month of August, when the crop looked at its best, never considering the amount of artifacial manure, &c, yearly laid on our unproductive soil, and then they think to oppress us as has been done in the past. Remedies.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",9
"10","—Enlarged crofts of average quality, with sufficient pasturage and peat ground for the township, the crofter to be entitled to full cornpensatien for buildings, fences, and permanent improvements on well-defined principles. Absolute security from eviction so long as the tenant does not exceed two years in arrears, and performs his duty as tenant. The rent should be judicially fixed by valuation by parties mutually chosen, and it ought not to be raised or the possession restricted earlier than thirty years.Personal Grievances.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",10
"11","—I produce one case out of many as an illustration to show you how improvements are stopped, and that we are not allowed to trench our own land. James Robertson, crofter and miller, Gruids, having about two acres in his croft which was not cultivated, he employed men to trench it. After he trenched one acre of the land and fenced it in, he received strict orders to stop improving his land, and he was compelled to pull up his fence, and this land is now only a common waste. Yet he has to pay for it. He has only been tenant there for five yeare, and the foregoing happened within the last two years. . James Robertson is present, and can substantiate this statement.'",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",11
"12","38816. I want to understand more exactly about the successive evictions. You speak of three evictions here. You say the first evictions were seventy years ago?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",12
"13","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",13
"14","38817. Is that the case?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",14
"15","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",15
"16","38818. Who was the proprietor of the estate then?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",16
"17","—Sir George Gunn Munro of Poyntsfield.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",17
"18","38819. When the first evictions took place was the whole of the land in the possession of the crofters, or were there already large tacks at that time ?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",18
"19","—Not at all. It was all in the possession of the crofters; the whole place at that time was in their possession.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",19
"20","38820. The hill land was held as common pasture?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",20
"21","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",21
"22","38821. At the time of the first evictions was the hill pasture taken and formed into a farm?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",22
"23","—No, I suppose they were evicted first, and both the arable and pasture combined were formed into a farm. They had both in their possession until such time as they were evicted.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",23
"24","38822. And both the arable and pasture were taken away?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",24
"25","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",25
"26","38823. What became of the crofters at that time; were they not allowed to remain in possession of some arable?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",26
"27","—No, they were removed to Clunel, and some went further. We have one here who can substantiate",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",27
"28","that statement.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",28
"29","38824. Was the whole place then made one farm?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",29
"30","—No, it is made into two farms.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",30
"31","38825. That was the first eviction sixty or seventy years ago; who got the farms?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",31
"32","—I can hardly state that; but I believe there is a man here who can state it.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",32
"33","38826. Were they given to strangers from outside, or to the people of Sutherland?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",33
"34","—They were not given to people of Sutherland. Certainly they were given to strangers.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",34
"35","38827. Then you speak of a second eviction. How long ago was that?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",35
"36","—Sixty years ago.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",36
"37","38828. What happened then?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",37
"38","—A most cruel eviction.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",38
"39","38829. Do you mean that the same people who had been evicted the first time seventy years ago were evicted again sixty years ago?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",39
"40","—I mean that.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",40
"41","38830. Where were they taken to?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",41
"42","—To the township of Gruids, and they are here to-day to prove it.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",42
"43","38831. Then you speak of a third eviction; when was the third eviction?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",43
"44","—Shortly after the same time.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",44
"45","38832. Then there has been no eviction for about fifty years?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",45
"46","—None at all.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",46
"47","38833. How long is it since the Matheson family became possessed of the estate?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",47
"48","—I think it will be about forty years ago. There were no evictions since then.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",48
"49","38831. From whom did they purchase the property?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",49
"50","—Sir George Gunn Munro.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",50
"51","38835. Since forty years there have been no evictions whatever?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",51
"52","—None whatever.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",52
"53","38336. Then since forty years has any ground been added to the crofters?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",53
"54","—It has been taken off them —miles of it.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",54
"55","38837. Since the Matheson family came?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",55
"56","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",56
"57","38838. Common pasture ground?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",57
"58","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",58
"59","38839. What was done with the common pasture ground which was taken off them?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",59
"60","—It was added to a sheep farm, and part of it, eighty acres, is planted.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",60
"61","38840. And when this pasture was taken away from them during the possession of the Mathesons, was any reduction of their rent made?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",61
"62","—None whatever.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",62
"63","38841. Was any other advantage given to them as a compensation?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",63
"64","—None whatsoever.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",64
"65","38842. To whom was the pasture given; who was the farmer?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",65
"66","—Mr Sellar.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",66
"67","38843. He is spoken of here as both factor and farmer. He was the factor for the estate?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",67
"68","—No, not at all.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",68
"69","38844. When in our present factor's possession?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",69
"70","—That is a different part of which I am talking—twenty-six years ago.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",70
"71","38845. When did the present factor obtain the farm?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",71
"72","—I don't know.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",72
"73","38846. Who is the present factor?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",73
"74","—Mr Fraser.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",74
"75","38847. Then Mr Fraser is both farmer and factor at the present moment ?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",75
"76","—No, he is not. ",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",76
"77","38848. How long is it since he ceased to be farmer?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",77
"78","—Seven years.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",78
"79","38849. But he was a long time farmer and factor?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",79
"80","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",80
"81","38850. And who is factor at present?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",81
"82","—Angus Bethune, residing in Inverness.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",82
"83","38851. Who resides on the farm?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",83
"84","—The manager or a man in partnership with him. But I have a letter from Mr Bethune to the effect that he was misled in his offer for the farm, for he thinks it too dear; and certainly it is not out of place to think it too dear when we pay 2s. 8d. for ours.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",84
"85","38852. During the last forty years, since the family came into possession, there has been no eviction, but there has been a diminution of the hill pasture. Has there been any increase of rent?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",85
"86","—None whatsoever.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",86
"87","38853. What is the average size of the holdings? How many acres of arable ground?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",87
"88","—Well, I think the largest is eighteen acres three poles. But it is in the possession of the ground officer, as they have the fat of the land—all those officials. That is the point of the letter.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",88
"89","38854. Don't let us enter into reflections. I want to know the fact?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",89
"90","—The fact is that the largest who has arable land pays about 7s. 6d. William Black",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",90
"91","38855. But generally speaking, what sort of crofts have they? Are they ten or five acres of arable? What is the full croft?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",91
"92","—I did not make up that, but the average rent is about £6, 10s.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",92
"93","38856. And what would be about the area of a croft at £6, 10s.?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",93
"94","—There are about 200 acres of arable land altogether and twenty-eight crofters.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",94
"95","38857. Then I suppose there are six or seven acres of arable ground a croft?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",95
"96","—Rather over seven.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",96
"97","38858. Is there a good hill pasture still left?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",97
"98","—No, it is bad hill pasture.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",98
"99","38859. Is it a large area?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",99
"100","—It amounts to 1200 acres.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",100
"101","38860. Do they run both cattle and sheep upon it?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",101
"102","—Both cattle and sheep and horses—in fact, too much,",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",102
"103","38861. About how many sheep?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",103
"104","—I have only two myself. I cannot say what the rest have, but the quality of the sheep is such that they are nearly turned into goats for the want of pasture, and the one must rise before the other lies down.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",104
"105","38862. On a £7 croft what stock is kept on an average?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",105
"106","—I cannot exactly say. I did not study that point.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",106
"107","38863. Would there be three cows on a £7 rent?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",107
"108","—I believe there would be.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",108
"109","38864. And a horse?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",109
"110","—A horse.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",110
"111","38865. How many sheep?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",111
"112","—I know some that are only paying £3 have twenty-four sheep, but that is on account of the estate regulations not being carried into effect. .",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",112
"113","38866. Would it be a usual thing to have three cows, one horse and twelve or twenty sheep?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",113
"114","—That is what we should have.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",114
"115","38867. Then whose fault is it that you have not got it?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",115
"116","—The officials. They do not look to that.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",116
"117","38868. They allow some to keep too many and others too few?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",117
"118","—They allow some to keep twenty-four sheep upon £3,-whereas I pay £13,12s. 6d. and have only two sheep.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",118
"119","38869. Still I don't get a general idea. A crofter who pays £7, say, would have about three cows, one horse, and a dozen sheep?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",119
"120","—Say a dozen sheep. The estate regulations carry two-sheep to the £1 , but that is too much for the extent of pasture we have.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",120
"121","38870. When the people were settled here did they receive any assistance in building their houses?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",121
"122","—None whatever.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",122
"123","38871. They built their houses and improved the ground entirely themselves?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",123
"124","—Yes. They got six weeks of Government money for what improvements they would do within the six months, and they have been paying for thirty-five years interest for the said money, so I believe they have done it all upon their own account.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",124
"125","38872. Some Government money was expended in improvements?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",125
"126","—All finished within six weeks were paid Government money. Some did improvements and some none at all.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",126
"127","38873. Is your hill pasture fenced?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",127
"128","—Yes, too hardly. It is fenced on either side.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",128
"129","38874. With a wire fence ?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",129
"130","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",130
"131","38875. Does not that protect you from the stock of the adjacent farms?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",131
"132","—Yes, but it keeps us out of occupation of the land which we  should have had, and which our forefathers had, and which they had for sixpence an acre, and which we pay 2s, 8d. for.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",132
"133","38876. When you say the adjacent farmer only pays sixpence an acre, does that include any arable ground on his holding?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",133
"134","—It includes all the arable land our forefathers tilled and gave to him in good order.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",134
"135","38877. Is any of that cultivated?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",135
"136","—There has been 1000 acres cultivated.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",136
"137","38878. But at the present moment?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",137
"138","—No, it is all grown with bracken and ferns and rushes. It will soon be a wilderness altogether, and a loss to the nation.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",138
"139","38879. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",139
"140","—You say—' In advance of the Royal Commission we had our winter stock taken up by the ground officer.' Do you mean the stock was counted over?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",140
"141","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",141
"142","38880. You are aware it was done for the Royal Commission ?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",142
"143","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",143
"144","38881. Did you raise objection to it?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",144
"145","—Well, I did not do it at the present time, because I was not there. I was in Inverness, but if I was at",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",145
"146","home I would not give them the privilege of numbering my stock, because I would think it was an imposition.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",146
"147","38882. You did not wish the Commission to know what stock you kept?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",147
"148","—I would not do anything against that.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",148
"149","38883. But you understand it was at the request of the Royal Commission that that numbering was done ?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",149
"150","—If that is the fact, it was all right.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",150
"151","38884. How long is it since James Robertson entered upon his croft?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",151
"152","—Five years.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",152
"153","38885. Did he get a lease?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",153
"154","—He did. He had a letter to that effect.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",154
"155","38886. Were any conditions contained in the letter?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",155
"156","—I am not sure. He is here present. But I know there is a gross injustice in the manner in which he has been treated. He has been a man that paid far more for his mill and land than any of those before him paid, and a persevering man, and he should be encouraged instead of oppressed.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",156
"157","38887. There is a statement you make, and other witnesses have made it in other places, that the crofters pay a very much larger rent for their land than the large farmers. Do you understand why it is that the landlord does not accept the larger rent if he has the opportunity of getting it?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",157
"158","—I understand that exactly, because the law is upon his side, and it is an unjust law, and that he has the power in his own hand of self-control, and he can do with the land what he pleases.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",158
"159","38888. But if he has an opportunity of getting a larger rent for his land, why does he not avail himself of that opportunity?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",159
"160","—Well, I have stated there that he does not get a larger rent.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",160
"161","388S9. If he accepted crofter tenants he would get a larger rent for his land?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",161
"162","—I believe so.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",162
"163","38890. Then why does he not do it?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",163
"164","—Because it is not in accordance with his own mind.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",164
"165","38891. Is it not a landlord's interest to get a larger rent if he can do so?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",165
"166","—Yes, but my statement does not confirm that; I say he gets a less rent for his land.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",166
"167","38892. But I want an explanation of the fact that the landlord is willing to accept a less rent from a large tenant. Why is it he is willing to accept that?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",167
"168","—Because he wishes to exclude us from the face of the earth, and send us over the ocean. I can see no other reason for it.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",168
"169","38893. You cannot see any object he has except getting rid of the people?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",169
"170","—It is his object. I cannot arrive at it, but I know there is gross injustice to us on that part.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",170
"171","38894. If you were to give up your croft would your landlord have any difficulty it letting in?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",171
"172","—No, he would not. ",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",172
"173","38895. There is a demand for it?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",173
"174","—Yes, and there is a demand for any land.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",174
"175","38896. And therefore he could let the large farm at a higher rent by dividing it among small tenants?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",175
"176","—I think he could.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",176
"177","38897. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",177
"178","—How many large farms are there on the estate?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",178
"179","—There are only two.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",179
"180","38898. What are the names of the tenants?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",180
"181","—There are Messrs Dobie and Martin, and Mr Angus Bethune, Inverness.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",181
"182","38899. How many crofters may there be altogether on the whole estate?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",182
"183","—There are twenty-eight, and there is a population of 184 upon that small piece of ground, 1400 acres.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",183
"184","38900. And what population is there upon the.two farms?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",184
"185","—A few shepherds. Messrs Dobie and Martin do not reside at all upon the land. They reside in Dumfriesshire. There are six or seven.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",185
"186","38901. Can you give me any idea how the land is divided. Do you know what is the acreage of the whole estate of Achany?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",186
"187","—I cannot exactly say, but there will be about 41,000.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",187
"188","38902. We shall say upwards of 40,000?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",188
"189","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",189
"190","38903. How much of the 40,000 acres is in these two farms?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",190
"191","—Nearly the whole 40,000 acres.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",191
"192","38904. How much have the crofters altogether?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",192
"193","—1400 altogether.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",193
"194","38905. Arable and pasture?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",194
"195","—Arable and pasture combined.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",195
"196","38906. Are there any cottars upon the lands of the tenants who do not pay any rent?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",196
"197","—There is only one now, but till the last year there were a good many.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",197
"198","38907. Were they a burden upon the crofters?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",198
"199","—Certainly, and they were put in defiantly against the crofters. I suppose they were in favour with the factor and ground officer and were put upon the tenant's pasture, and at present they are the best off in the whole township. ",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",199
"200","38908. Do you feel sure you are right in stating there is 1000 acres of land which had once been tilled by the small tenants that is now lying waste, or nearly so?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",200
"201","—Yes, I believe I am quite justified in stating that. I suppose there would be no harm in referring to this letter which I received from Mr Bethune, and you can judge a little from that, which will confirm so much of my statement.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",201
"202","38909. Will you tell me for whom was the clearance first made in the time of Munro of Poyntsfield? What big farmer came in?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",202
"203","—Mr M'Gregor.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",203
"204","38910. Who was he?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",204
"205","—I cannot exactly state. That is too far back, but I have men present who can state it.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",205
"206","38911. At all events he was a stranger?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",206
"207","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",207
"208","38912. Now, tell me something about the farm that Mr Fraser, who was long factor and is now factor, had?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",208
"209","—The farm of Clunel.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",209
"210","38913. Is that the one Bethune now occupies?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",210
"211","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",211
"212","38914. Do you know what rent he was paying?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",212
"213","—I don't know. I think it would need to be a pretty small one.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",213
"214","38915. What reason had he for not giving employment when there was any farm work necessary on the farm? Why did he not employ the people on the estate?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",214
"215","—There might be reasons, but I cannot arrive at them assuredly, but he was a banker at Dornoch, and there might be bills in his bank, and if he sent men up who had bills in his bank he could redeem them. But the tenants were kept out of employment, as well as the pasture was taken off.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",215
"216","38916. Then though no rise of rent has been put on you since the time of the Mathesons, yet, at the same time, having been deprived of pasture, you consider yourselves aggrieved?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",216
"217","—-We do, and we are deprived of this melioration labour as well, which is bound to make us worse than in Sir George Gunn Munro's time. I put in a copy of the original melioration letter, which is as follows :",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",217
"218","—-' I, George Gunn Munro, proprietor of the estate Poyntsfield and Gruids, bind myself and my heirs and successors whomsoever to pay melioration to the small tenants on Clunel and Pitarvie, Terry Mill, or any other stances thereabout, for any neat stone and lime cottages, byres, barns, &c, and stone dykes they may build, which shall be paid them at whatever period they may remove or be removed, the value of what they may be worth at outgoing to be ascertained by judges mutually chosen; this is provided all such will be finished by learned tradesmen. And as a further encouragement will make a present of a guinea note to each of tenants of six first finished with chimneys at each end of their said houses. Given under my hand, Poyntsfield House, on this 11th day of August 1834, and a separate letter to the above agreement will be given to each separately as their houses are finished (signed) GEORGE GUNN MUNRO.'",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",218
"219","38917. You complain that upon the sale of the estate the new proprietor raised the rents?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",219
"220","—Yes. The old proprietor fell into debt and the estate was entailed, and he rented the Gruids tenants to the highest they could go, and they remain there yet, and all the privilege he gave them is taken",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",220
"221","away from them. The hill pasture is taken away and eighty acres of plantation is put there, and there was more poiuted out last week which I could not get in my statement, and in the face of all this I see Lady Matheson is again pointing out some pasture to be planted.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",221
"222","38918. Do you mean that your remnants of 1400 acres are still to be diminished?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",222
"223","—Exactly, and it is one thing certain that with the privileges there stated and the miles of pasture we had, we must be in a worse state now than we were then.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",223
"224","38919. Is anything done on the part of the proprietrix for the people on the estate?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",224
"225","—None.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",225
"226","38920. Is any encouragement given?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",226
"227","—None at all; not even a handstake out of the wood, and that is little enough.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",227
"228","38921. Is any money spent in any benevolent or charitable way?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",228
"229","—None whatever. There has been no reduction of rent for all the bad years, and the game going away with the half of our crop. There has been nothing done whatever.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",229
"230","38922. The Chairman.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",230
"231","—I want to ask you again respecting this engagement to give compensation for a better kind of houses. This is a promise on the part of the old proprietor that he will give a bonus of one guinea to the first six who build improved houses, and that he will give them compensation for houses when built of a particular character. Have any such good stone and lime houses with two chimneys been built?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",231
"232","—They have been all built of that quality.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",232
"233","38923. Then in your township all the houses are improved houses with chimneys?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",233
"234","—Altogether, with the exception of one or two.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",234
"235","38924. Do you know any particular case in which an occupier has left his improved house and has asked for compensation, and has been refused compensation; has a case arisen?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",235
"236","—I cannot answer that question directly.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",236
"237","38925. Has this engagement of the former proprietor been distinctly repudiated by the present proprietor?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",237
"238","—Certainly.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",238
"239","38926. You mean they will not give a similar engagement at the present day?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",239
"240","—Yes, none whatever. They refuse it altogether.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",240
"241","38927. They do not admit the validity of this engagement?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",241
"242","—No. The excuse they put to us was that it was not stamped.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",242
"243","38928. [To John Ross].",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",243
"244","— Have you got a paper?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",244
"245","—John Ross. Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",245
"246","—The grievances of the Gruids crofters are the smallness of their holdings, both of arable and pasture. Some of us pay as high as £1, 6s. an acre for very inferior soil. There is a population of 184 depending on about 1400 acres of land between arable and pasture for their livelihood, while the three neighbouring tacksmen occupy thirty times as much. Another grievance is bad dwelling houses and steadings, for if it rains outside for three hours it rains inside for six. Twenty-six years ago we were deprived of the most and best of our pasture, no reduction being given in our rents. At the same time we were threatened with eviction, unknown to the proprietor we believe, by a report published in a newspaper concerning the said threatened evictions. When the factor came to know of such a report being published he persuaded a few of us to sign a document to the effect that it was all a falsehood, and published the same in a newspaper. Shortly after we were deprived of the pasture, we inquired of the factor what to do with our sheep, the answer given us was "" Eat them."" Although we were needful of mutton at the time, ewes and lambs would not be very palatable to eat in the mouth of May, Another injustice done on the estate was that of exacting labour from men without paying them. A man having the value of £3, 5s. of land, arable and pasture, could not be supposed to work for nothing to the proprietor. Although the soil of his croft would be as productive as any in Scotland, it would not be adequate to supply the wants of a family of six persons. Our greatest grievance is want of land, arable and pasture, and the inferior quality of what we do occupy. It is not easy for people to keep the tenth commandment while they can see thousands of acres of good productive land in our neighbourhood, but nothing can be seen there but the ruins of crofters' houses and sheep roaming over it, and we poor people labouring among peat bogs and rocks. We don't blame proprietors, factors, or ground officers but only in a measure for the tyrannical oppression waged 'against us; but we blame the existing land laws, which permit such oppression to be carried into effect. We only say that proprietors, factors, and ground officers should be more humane than they have been towards their fellow-creatures. God says he has no respect of persons, therefore we understand the poor were not created to be persecuted and oppressed by the rich. No doubt, eviction is not carried on to such an alarming extent now-a-days, but the people are so much curtailed of the privileges they once possessed that they cannot live comfortably in their present circumstances. It would make people think of their wings and fly to the colonies, but behold their wings are clipped so that they cannot fly, andworse still there are no prospects of them growing under the present land law administration. What could a penniless man do on arriving in the colonies ? He could not erect a house, buy stock, seed, nor farm implements. As a remedy, we earnestly advocate the extension of the franchise; we further want, as remedies to better our condition, more land, arable and pasture, compensation for improvements and for damage done by game, also a permanent hold of the soil, so that eviction be heard of no more. Eviction is a disgrace to our nation; such oppression has not been perpetrated among the uncivilised tribes, and still it has been done in a country whose law-makers profess to be enlightened Christians.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",246
"247","38929. You belong to a different township?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",247
"248","—It is the same township, but a different part of the township.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",248
"249","38930. Mr Cameron.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",249
"250","—You complain here of the badness of the houses. Then these houses were not those spoken of by the last witness, which were good houses, and for which they failed to obtain the meliorations",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",250
"251","stipulated for by the proprietor?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",251
"252","—The walls are good, but they are not capable of keeping out the rain.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",252
"253","38931. Is it a grievance with you or your neighbours that they cannot obtain those meliorations spoken of by the last witness?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",253
"254","—Surely it must be.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",254
"255","38932. If the houses were originally good, why do not the tenants keep them wind and watertight?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",255
"256","—There is nothing they can keep them watertight with.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",256
"257","38933. Cannot they use lime?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",257
"258","—They are thatched houses. There is no slate. They are built of stone and lime walls.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",258
"259","38934. Why cannot they renew the thatch as it gets old?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",259
"260","—They have nothing to renew it with unless they use their straw, and that curtails their provender for their cattle.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",260
"261","38935. Where did the thatch originally come from?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",261
"262","—It was turf.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",262
"263","38936. Could they not supply thatch from the same place that it came from originally?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",263
"264","—No.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",264
"265","38937. Why not ?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",265
"266","—Because it is not there.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",266
"267","38938. What was it?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",267
"268","—Turf.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",268
"269","38939. Is there no turf where it came from?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",269
"270","—That might last for a year or so, but whenever the turf is done it is as bad as ever.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",270
"271","38940. Not knowing the place myself I do not understand you; but on other crofting farms the crofters, as it is required, repair their houses and keep them in repair. What I want to know from you is what peculiarity there is in your circumstances which prevents you doing what other crofters in the Highlands do?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",271
"272","—We do as much as we can. But whatever can be done without the houses being slated, they will not be watertight.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",272
"273","38941. You were deprived apparently of the best of your pasture twenty-six years ago?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",273
"274","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",274
"275","38942. That was a more recent period than was spoken of by the last witness?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",275
"276","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",276
"277","38943. It was in the time of the late Sir James Matheson?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",277
"278","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",278
"279","38944. Are your rents about the same on an average as the rents of the other part of the township spoken of by your friend here?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",279
"280","—Yes. Some of them are higher and some lower.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",280
"281","38945. And no reduction was made when your pasture was taken away?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",281
"282","—No.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",282
"283","38946. Was any arrangement made at the time or any remonstrance made by the tenants?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",283
"284","—No, I don't think it.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",284
"285","38947. They submitted quietly to it?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",285
"286","—The factor requested three of them to sign a document giving over their claim, and promised the piece we all occupy between us to the three men if they would sign a document that they had no claim on the rest.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",286
"287","38948. Did they get it?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",287
"288","—No, when they signed it he gave as good a right to the whole as to these three men.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",288
"289","38949. What was the piece of land that these three wished to sign away, provided they got it themselves, and which was afterwards given to the whole of the people that did not sign? Was that the land you complain of as having been taken away from your hill pasture?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",289
"290","—No; the land we now occupy was promised to three men if they gave over their claim to the rest.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",290
"291","38950. But did not you have it before?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",291
"292","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",292
"293","38951. Then bow could it be promised to you if it was in your possession?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",293
"294","—They had it already in their possession, but the others had it in possession as well, but the others were not to have it in their possession afterwards.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",294
"295","—William Black The factor could not bribe the others.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",295
"296","38952. Who occupied this bit of land you say the factor tried to bribe the others to give away?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",296
"297","—John Ross. The whole tenants. ",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",297
"298","38953. Then is this the land you complain of as having been taken away?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",298
"299","—Part of it. ",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",299
"300","38954. Then the factor got those three people to agree to give it away? ",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",300
"301","—Yes. ",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",301
"302","38955. And they signed this paper?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",302
"303","—Yes. ",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",303
"304","38956. And then the land, as I understand, was not given to the three but left with the whole of the crofters?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",304
"305","—Part of it we got back.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",305
"306","38957. But did the document signed by the three crofters refer to this part, or did it refer to the whole?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",306
"307","—To the one part. The half was to be taken off. They were to sign a document that they were willing to give away the half of it, if they got the other half of it among the three of them.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",307
"308","38958. And the result of it was that the half of it was left with the whole crofters, and the three men did not get the other half?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",308
"309","—No.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",309
"310","38959. Who got it?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",310
"311","—-The factor and Mr Sellar.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",311
"312","38960. You say one injustice on the estate was that of exacting labour from men without paying them; was that an old practice on the estate?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",312
"313","—No, it was not a practice, but it was done on the estate.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",313
"314","38961. Then if it was done was it the practice?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",314
"315","—It was done once.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",315
"316","38962. Was it constantly done?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",316
"317","—No, it was done once.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",317
"318","38963. You mean in the case of one man or in one year?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",318
"319","—More than one man, but only in one year.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",319
"320","38964. I suppose the people remonstrated against it, and it was not done any more?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",320
"321","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",321
"322","38965. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",322
"323","—You said in your paper that you complained of game?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",323
"324","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",324
"325","38966. What is the nature of your complaint? Is it of hares and rabbits?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",325
"326","—No, black game and grouse. The whole of us do not complain of it, but some of us who are near the wood; and in a late season there is a great deal of damage done by game.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",326
"327","38967. Have you any rabbits?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",327
"328","—No.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",328
"329","38968. To bring out a little clearer about this land taken from you twenty-six years ago, the factor took it himself?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",329
"330","—Between himself and Mr Sellar.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",330
"331","38969. Had they or either of them land before then in their occupation ?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",331
"332","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",332
"333","38970. That was close by your hill land?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",333
"334","—Yes; our hill pasture was between theirs—a strip straight between theirs.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",334
"335","38971. And they thought it would suit them very well, I suppose?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",335
"336","—Yes, and so it did.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",336
"337","38972. Did the factor allege or give any reason why he was doing this against the people, or did he just call the three people quietly together to try and make this arrangement? Did he consult the whole of you about it?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",337
"338","—I am not exactly sure. I was not of age at the time. I have only other men's statements.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",338
"339","38973. What might it be worth to you at this moment —this pasture the half of which was taken away from you?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",339
"340","—It would be worth sixpence an acre to us.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",340
"341","38974. Can you give us any idea how many acres there are in it?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",341
"342","—No; there is a considerable amount.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",342
"343","38975. More than 1000 acres?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",343
"344","—About 1000 acres.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",344
"345","—William Black. There are more than 4000 acres—four or five miles of pasture.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",345
"346","38976. Then they took away more than the half?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",346
"347","—Yes, we have only a small piece in comparison to what we had.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",347
"348","38977. [To John Ross],",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",348
"349","—Do you carry on any other business besides being a crofter?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",349
"350","—-John Ross. Yes, in labouring work.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",350
"351","38978. Is it you that pays £ 3?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",351
"352","—- Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",352
"353","38979. Are the most of the crofting tenants old possessors of the place? Have they been there from time immemorial?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",353
"354","—Most of them. ",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",354
"355","38980. Did you make any representation to the late Sir James Matheson, or since his death to Lady Matheson, about your possession, that you are now so very much scrimped for land?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",355
"356","—I did not, but others did.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",356
"357","38981. I mean did the crofters generally do sol",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",357
"358","—Yes, to the factor.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",358
"359","38982. What answer did you get?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",359
"360","—William Black. We were denied any reduction whatever.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",360
"361","38983. The Chairman.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",361
"362","—You complained about the difficulty of making water-tight roofs for the houses. Is there any rule on the estate about slating?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",362
"363","—No, not any.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",363
"364","38984. Will the proprietor give slates for a certain payment or on certain conditions to the crofters?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",364
"365","—No.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",365
"366","38985. There is no rule whatever?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",366
"367","—No. Although you would pay interest for it you will not get it. I have offered that.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",367
"368","38986. Is there any labour now exacted without payment?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",368
"369","—John Ross. No, none whatever.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",369
"370","38987. Are you cognizant of the particular case of the miller who was prevented trenching his ground? Do you know the circumstances of that case?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",370
"371","—Yes.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",371
"372","38988. Can you give any reason why he was prevented; can you imagine any reason? What was the motive of the proprietor in preventing this improvement?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",372
"373","—I think she was of the mind to plant it. That is my belief. She is planting quite close to it.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",373
"374","38989. Now, with reference to planting, the previous witness, I think, mentioned the project of planting as a hardship. Does planting give some occupation to the people?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",374
"375","—It might for a very short time, but that would not last as long as the pasture.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",375
"376","38990. Do the people obtain any permanent employment in connection with the plantations?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",376
"377","—Not any permanent employment.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",377
"378","38991. Are they not employed in thinning and draining the woods at all?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",378
"379","—No, not at all.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",379
"380","38992. Is the proprietor in the habit of giving any wood or branches, or any advantage of that sort, out of the woods?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",380
"381","—They have the advantage of getting some birch.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",381
"382","—William Black. Oh, there is nothing whatsoever.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",382
"383","38993. I mean, is the existence of plantations in the country of any use or benefit to the people?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",383
"384","—Well, we are not so much against plantations as we are against deer forests and sheep farming, but at the same time, when it comes to taking away our small piece of pasture, and we think it a great grievance, because, although we get a few days' work there, we lose it altogether in the future.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",384
"385","38994. You would rather see the plantations made upon the farmer's ground than upon your own?",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",385
"386","—I believe so, and I think it is but justice to us that are natives of the soil and loyal to our proprietors.",640,"William Black, John Ross","Sutherland, Golspie",386
