"1","ALEXANDER M'NEIL, Crofter, Smercleit (80)—examined. ",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",1
"2","11703. The Chairman",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",2
"3","—You have a croft ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",3
"4","—I have half a croft. ",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",4
"5","11704. You have a written statement?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",5
"6","—Yes.—' Smerclet, South Uist, May 28, 1883. My Lords and Gentlemen, The troubles that we are getting here are just the want of land. The land that our fathers had is divided among two or three persons. The way that our fathers were paying the land was working on cut kelp, but these are gone away now, and there is nothing now wanting on us but the money ; although the cut kelp stopped, the rent is still the same, it is not getting low, but still rising higher. It is not a wonder that we are poor, although we would be working, the pay would be Is. 3d. a day till two or three years, when it rose higher. The land that our fathers and grandfathers had for the cattle we cannot now let them on, or else they are locked up and pounded by farmers. Some two or three years before the people from her Ladyship would come, and they would take away the cattle that we would be going to sell, and would give to us for these what would please themselves, and we would not know what they did. Although we have cattle, it is not our own, but it belongs to the person who is giving us food. This person is Mr Donald Fergusson; and if he will it till he is paid, and the rest of it to the governor, we will have nothing. The bad way that they were governing us before this, were the governor took some meal to this country, and a person had to work for a whole day on roads and trenches with spades for one pound of meal. Poor-rate money and school money are taken from us along with the rent every year, and we do know what they are doing with it, and they are still getting higher. We have very bad land here, but it is worse just now, as the water of the mill is making a great damage to it, and the rent is still the same. After all things if we would get plenty of land, and the rent as they shall see better at any price, but not on the price of a factor or a governor.—SMERCLEIT CROFTERS.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",6
"7","11705. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—How many crofters are there in Smercleit ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",7

"9","11706. And how many families ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",9
"10","—There are two families for each of these crofts, and one or two outside on the moor.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",10
"11","11707. Were they all agreed to send you here?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",11
"12","—Yes. I have been freely elected a representative to appear here.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",12
"13","11708. Did they all hear this paper read?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",13
"14","—Yes.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",14
"15","11709. Used you to pay your rent in labour, cutting kelp?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",15
"16","—My father always paid his rent by kelp, and he never had any occasion to buy any meal for food.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",16
"17","11710. Did you make kelp yourselves, or did you merely cut the seaweed for the proprietor ",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",17
"18","—We ourselves manufactured the kelp.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",18
"19","11711. Did you yourselves sell the kelp or merely get paid by the proprietor for your labour ",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",19
"20","—We never sold a pound but to the proprietor.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",20
"21","11712. Were you paid by the labour or by the quantity of kelp?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",21
"22","— According to the weight delivered over to the proprietor, so much per ton.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",22
"23","11713. How much per ton",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",23
"24","—£2, 10s., £2, and sometimes £ 3 per ton for kelp.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",24
"25","11714. Why is that system discontinued ",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",25
"26","—I think the proprietrix does not care to continue this kelp manufacture, because it does not pay. ",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",26
"27","11715. Can she not get more money for the kelp than she has to pay for it ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",27
"28","—I believe that latterly the price fell very much, so that she was realising little if anything for the sale of kelp, and therefore it was discontinued.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",28
"29","11716. You say the pay you used to get was 1s. 3d. a day till two or three years back, when it rose higher. What pay do you now get ",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",29
"30","—I have been working some days, and receiving 2s. 6d.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",30
"31","11717. How many people were there at Smercleit when you first remember?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",31

"37","11720. Are you sure?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",37
"38","—Perfectly sure.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",38
"39","11721. And there are now twenty-four, and some odd ones outside on the moor ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",39
"40","—Yes.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",40
"41","11722. Has the factor ever taken away any cattle from you at a less price than you could have got for them elsewhere ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",41
"42","—There are lads along with me here from whom cattle were taken the other year, and they ought to tell what they got for them.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",42
"43","11723. What are their names ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",43
"44","—John M'Millan and Roderick M'Caskill.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",44
"45","11724. Is there a system of valuation when the cattle are taken?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",45
"46","—They were valued at Askernish.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",46
"47","11725. And do you think the value was insufficient?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",47
"48","—I don't think it was much under the market price.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",48
"49","11726. Who appoints the valuators?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",49
"50","—The proprietor.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",50
"51","11727. Does he appoint both valuators?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",51
"52","—Yes, both.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",52
"53","11728. How long is it since the people had to work a whole day on the roads for a pound of meal ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",53
"54","—In the year of the potato failure.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",54

"56","11730. What satisfaction did you get from Mr Macdonald?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",56
"57","—He said he would do his best to put that right, and he has helped us to some extent since he promised.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",57
"58","11731. You say you are willing if you get more land to pay a fair rent for it, but not on the price of a factor or a governor. How do you want the rent settled ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",58
"59","—If that is mentioned in the paper the paper is not right. Who can or will settle it except the factor? I am sure the Royal Commission will not assist me in fixing the rent, and therefore we must go to the factor.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",59
"60","11732. What rent do you yourself now pay ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",60
"61","—£3, 10s.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",61
"62","11733. What stock have you on the land?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",62

"64","11734. Have you any young beasts ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",64
"65","—I have one stirk and a calf.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",65

"68","11736. Do you know the extent of your croft?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",68
"69","—I believe my share of the croft is about 6 or 7 acres.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",69
"70","11737. Is it all cultivated, or is part of it in grass?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",70
"71","—Very little can be afforded to be left. We are constantly turning it.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",71
"72","11738. How many barrels of potatoes do you plant usually?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",72
"73","—I plant nine or ten barrels and take none out.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",73
"74","11739. That was last season, but in an ordinary season what return do you get ",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",74
"75","—In a very good year I might take out forty barrels as the result of planting nine or ten.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",75
"76","11740. How much oats and barley do you sow?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",76
"77","—I sow about four or five barrels of seed oats and I don't fill these barrels again at the end of the season when threshing them out.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",77
"78","11741. And barley?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",78
"79","—I get hold of a little of the barley. A storm carried off the land altogether, but in ordinary years I have more return from the barley than from the oats.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",79
"80","11742. What barley do you sow?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",80
"81","—Three or four bushels.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",81
"82","11743. And what return do you get ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",82
"83","—About two bags of grain.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",83
"84","11744. Do you make meal of the barley?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",84
"85","—Yes.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",85
"86","11745. Do you make meal of the oats ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",86
"87","—No.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",87
"88","11746. Is it for the sake of the straw you sow oats?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",88
"89","—Altogether for the sake of the straw.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",89
"90","11747. Would it not be better to sow grass and get hay?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",90
"91","—I believe it could not be worse.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",91
"92","11748. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—Have you been all your days in the same town ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",92
"93","—Yes, always ; over sixty years in the same township.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",93
"94","11749. In your younger days were the people more comfortable in their circumstances or more cheerful in their dispositions than they are now ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",94
"95","—We are constantly growing poorer—three times poorer than in my earliest recollection. I have nothing to eat unless I get it from these merchants at Loch Boisdale.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",95
"96","11750. Is it a fact that in your younger days you produced most of the meal that was required from your own crofts ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",96
"97","—Yes, when my father had a croft for himself he never bought a pound of meal, and in those days the potatoes would be in heaps.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",97
"98","11751. Are the people as cheerful in their minds and dispositions now as they were then ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",98
"99","—No, not half. They cannot be very happy when they are hungry.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",99
"100","11752. Are you aware there is a very considerable scarcity of milk for the children compared with what existed in your younger days ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",100
"101","—When I was young I would get more milk than I would drink. To-day we cannot get a mouthful at all, many of us.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",101
"102","11753. That is not, I presume, on account of the milk being sold or sent out of the country by the people themselves ?—They don't sell milk here at all.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",102
"103","11754. Is it because they haven't it ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",103
"104","—Because they haven't it. The few eggs they have they sell for tea, and that is the substitute for milk.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",104
"105","11755. Will you say, when the charge is made against you and others that you consume so much tea, that it is a substitute now for milk ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",105
"106","—That is my answer.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",106
"107","11756. And does it apply to your class generally?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",107
"108","—Yes, it is quite true of those in my position. I am certain that it is.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",108
"109","11757. Was it common for the people to go to the south and other places in search of wages to support those at home ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",109
"110","—When I was young no one had to leave the country to labour. Instead of going south they used to labour at kelp at home ; but now, in the absence of that industry, they are obliged to run away to the east country or wherever they can get employment. ",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",110
"111","11758. Taking this parish of South Uist, was it more populous in your young days than it is now ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",111
"112","—Not so numerous as to-day. They are much more numerous to-day than they were then.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",112
"113","11759. That is your opinion ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",113
"114","—Yes.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",114
"115","11760. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—Do the calves get more milk than they used to get ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",115
"116","—The prices are decidedly better than they used to be. I don't think the milk is even so plentiful to give to calves as it was in those days.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",116
"117","11761. Is that because the grass is less?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",117
"118","—Just so—just on account of the want of grass—no grass at all.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",118
"119","11762. Do you mean the lands you have are over stocked ?",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",119
"120","—Yes.",199,"Alexander Mcneil","South Uist, Lochboisdale",120
