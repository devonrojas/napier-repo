"1","JOHN M'FADYEN, Crofter, Caolis (42)—examined.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",1
"2","33466. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",2
"3","—You have a written statement to submit ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",3
"4","—I have. ' To the Royal Commissioners, Highlands and Islands. I represent the small crofters of Caolis, Ruaig, and Salum, who complain of:—",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",4
"5","(1) The smallness of our holdings, the inferior quality of the soil, through continual cropping, there being no room for rotation of crop.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",5
"6","(2) High rent and the high-handedness of factors in using every means to exact more rent from us ; for example, a late factor got all the crofters to sign a paper to him, that they would comply with anything he would see proper to do to them, or they would be evicted, and when he got them to do so, he raised two times their rent. The consequence is yet seen in our poverty. Under these circumstances, we petitioned his Grace the Duke of Argyle last December for a reduction of rent, but were refused; his Grace, however, gave some help in seed to those that could not sow their crofts, and offered leases to those that did not sign the petition, and were better off than their neighbours before.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",6
"7","(3) Paying rent for drains made thirty-six or thirty-seven years ago, which ought to have ceased in twenty years: these drains are now useless. ",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",7
"8","(4) Having to buy almost all the meal we require, as well as about £6 worth of coals yearly, and all the wood we use for building or repairing our houses. ",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",8
"9","(5) Having had formerly to work about twelve days a year on the estate without payment of any kind, and that at any time of the year the factor saw proper to send for us; if we refused, we would be fined. ",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",9
"10","(6) The partiality of factors in favouring the larger tenants against the small crofters, when the larger tenants can get the factors to remove cottars from their own larger holdings, and put them on the small crofts against the crofters' will. ",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",10
"11","(7) We are under all these disadvantages, while the half of the island is under large sheep tacks held by strangers, and the people of the island are not allowed so much of the land as to make a living off it. The large tacks are the cause of much of the pauperism in the island. The people having been evicted from their holdings and removed to the sea-shore, and their holdings converted unto sheep tacks, six of which are held by three individuals. ",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",11
"12","(8) There is no harbour accommodation where goods and passengers can be landed or shipped by steamers of ordinary size in rough weather, in consequence of which goods and sometimes passengers are taken north until the steamers land them, if possible, when returning south The postal communication is also so irregular that for a fortnight at a time neither letters nor papers are received in the island ; nor is there a post running between the post-office at Scaranish and the east end. Our demands are more land, fair rent, fixity of tenure, and compensation for improvements.'",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",12
"13","—Signed by JOHN M'FADYEN, Caolis, delegate, and by nineteen others.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",13
"14","33467. What is the extent in acres of your crofts at Caolis ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",14
"15","—-There might perhaps be about twelve acres of arable land in addition to the outrun; but in some cases the outrun has been apportioned along with the arable ground; the acreage in this case is larger, of course.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",15
"16","33468. But the extent of arable land is usually about twelve acres ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",16
"17","—Short of twelve perhaps.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",17
"18","33469. Is that not sufficient for a rotation of crops?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",18
"19","—I am afraid not; there is a good deal of the land within the arable area that is rocky and unsuited for cultivation, and that is counted of course in the acreage.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",19
"20","33470. What extent of arable land would you think sufficient to admit a rotation of cropping?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",20
"21","—To make a crofter comfortable probably he would require about twenty-four acres.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",21
"22","33471. Besides the outrun?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",22
"23","—Yes, besides the outrun.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",23
"24","33472. You don't think a rotation of crops could be carried out without an acreage of that extent ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",24
"25","—The ground is so poor and gives forth such poor crops that I think we could scarcely maintain much stock upon all the arable land that we do plough just now.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",25
"26","33473. How long is it since you signed the paper which the late factor asked you to sign?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",26
"27","—Thirty years ago, perhaps.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",27
"28","33474. That is given as an example of the high-handedness of factors; can you give a more modern instance?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",28
"29","—There are many examples of highhandedness down to the present day, but some of them are specified in the other papers sent in to-day, and those who sent them in are more capable of speaking of them. But this high-handedness does continue.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",29
"30","33475. How much meal are the people generally obliged to buy in the course of the year, on an average ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",30
"31","—Twenty-one bolls per family this year in the township of Caolis; but this year is exceptional.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",31
"32","33476. Do you grind any of your own corn ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",32
"33","—Yes, we grind some barley some years—very little.)",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",33
"34","33477. What amount on an average will you make from your own crops ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",34
"35","—Some of us make none at all. They have more than enough to do after feeding the stock to sow down crop again; some of us have to buy seed.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",35
"36","33478. Do you use the whole produce of the croft in feeding your cattle ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",36
"37","—The greater number give to the cattle the whole of the barley and oats. Of course, the potatoes always go to the family; but there are others who send something to the mill.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",37
"38","33479. Do you keep more than one horse usually ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",38
"39","—Two.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",39
"40","33480. On twelve acres of arable land?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",40
"41","—Yes.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",41
"42","33481. What quantity of potatoes do you usually raise ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",42
"43","—Perhaps fifty to sixty barrels in an average year, off an average croft; some more, some less",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",43
"44","33482. Do you sell potatoes?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",44
"45","—They are always sold out of the island more or less; but there has scarcely been any sold out of our township the last four years.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",45
"46","33483. Do you sell some when you have sixty barrels ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",46
"47","—Yes, we would.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",47
"48","33484. What quantity would you use yourselves ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",48
"49","—Probably between thirty and forty barrels. That would depend of course upon the number of the family, but it is an average.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",49
"50","33485. How long is it since you ceased to give twelve days' work in the year to the estate ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",50
"51","—It has not entirely ceased yet. In Mr Campbell's time it was twelve days, and it got less, and now there may be a few days now and again ; it has not yet ceased. We do not complain of it now.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",51
"52","33486. For what purpose is that work given ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",52
"53","—Any kind of work. We were once obliged to put up a fence between two large tacks—a stone wall six feet high. We had to do the whole work; quarry the stone,  carry, and all. I built it.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",53
"54","33487. That has ceased to be a ground of complaint now?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",54
"55","—Yes, unless it may begin again.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",55
"56","33488. Have any cottars been taken off the large farms and put upon the crofters' lands at Caolis ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",56
"57","—Not out of the large tacks, but they were taken off some other crofts that were consolidated into one, and they were removed as matter of favour to the sitting tenant, and made to settle down upon the smaller crofters' holdings.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",57
"58","33489. In Caolis ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",58
"59","—Yes.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",59
"60","33490. How many instances of that have there been at Caolis since you remember?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",60
"61","—I and three neighbours had a piece of outrun attached to our arable ground, and four crofters who were removed from their holdings were settled down upon this outrun of ours. There were instances of sitting upon an individual croft.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",61
"62","33491. Who got this ground?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",62
"63","—A man who was a bachelor, and who had no one to look after; but he was in favour with the factor. He is",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",63
"64","not living now.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",64
"65","33492. What was the extent of those four crofts, or what was the rent of them ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",65
"66","—There was only one croft, although there were three families upon it. Two of them were in the rent-book, and one was a cottar. They were moving to make room for him, and sent off upon our land.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",66
"67","33493. Had this old bachelor any other land besides ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",67
"68","—No.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",68
"69","33494. Had those two crofters and the cottar grown up upon that piece of land, or had they been crowded in upon it ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",69
"70","—Yes, they belonged to the place.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",70
"71","33495. What rent do you pay ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",71
"72","—£14, 8s.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",72
"73","33496. What have you —stock and acreage ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",73
"74","—Ten or twelve acres of arable ground, two horses —one of them only about a year old, three cows, a quey, two stirks, two sheep. The place is rather fully stocked; the croft would scarcely feed them well.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",74
"75","33497. Have you beyond this arable acreage any outrun belonging to you individually?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",75
"76","—There is a portion of outrun to some extent, but principally rocky, and five of us have the right to put stock upon it. One of us only puts a horse upon it.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",76
"77","33498. What extent will it be ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",77
"78","—Probably thirty or forty acres, rock and all.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",78
"79","33499. Have you any pasture besides for the whole township?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",79
"80","—No, nothing; that is all The outrun of the other crofts is allotted to each croft separately.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",80
"81","33500. Do you consider your rent too high?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",81
"82","—Yes.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",82
"83","33501. Do all the rents bear the same proportion to the land that yours does, or about it?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",83
"84","—Probably it is much about the same : some may be cheaper.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",84
"85","33502. You think yours is dearer than ordinary ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",85
"86","—Well, perhaps it is. ",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",86
"87","33503. Do the large farmers pay lower rents than the crofters in proportion to their acreage?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",87
"88","—Perhaps some of the large farmers may be dearer than the crofts, but take them all round, considering their extent, I should say the crofting communities are as highly rented.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",88
"89","33504. What would you consider a fair rent for your croft and right of pasturage ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",89
"90","—I think, considering the stock it keeps, it is dear enough at half the present rent.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",90
"91","33505. How do you arrive at the value of the land?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",91
"92","—I fix the rent in proportion to the amount of stock the croft can provide for. We practically take little out of the produce of the croft itself. It is the outcome of the stock that provides our rent and the value of the croft.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",92
"93","33506. That being so, what value of rent do you put upon the horse, the cow, and the sheep ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",93
"94","—I look upon it this way : the horses are employed for cultivating the croft, and we take no profit out of them, so we do not count them in making up the rent. I would set apart, perhaps, 25s. or 30s. for each cow.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",94
"95","33507. But if a man keeps two horses on twelve acres of land, is he not consuming in an unprofitable way a large proportion of the produce of the croft ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",95
"96","—I can scarcely admit that it is unprofitable. We cannot do with one horse; the ground is light and sandy, and some of it mossy ; it must be ploughed quick, and sown when it is ploughed. One horse won't do, and unless we have a horse we cannot have the crops at all.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",96
"97","33508. Can two of you not arrange to keep two horses between you ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",97
"98","—I tried it, and we could not get on with it ; not but we agreed well enough, but we would be behind hand with the work.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",98
"99","33509. Then if instead of having twelve awes of land you had twentyfour, would you require four horses ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",99
"100","—No; the two horses would cultivate more land equally well as the present croft.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",100
"101","33510. Why then will they not do it when it is divided between two men, if they would if one man had it ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",101
"102","—There is a great difference. The neighbour may have other work to do with the horse when I would like",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",102
"103","it to plough. It may be he is carrying sea-ware when I would like to be at the plough.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",103
"104","33511. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",104
"105","—Are you a native of the island?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",105
"106","—Yes.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",106
"107","33512. Are you well acquainted with it?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",107
"108","—Yes, I know it ; but I live upon one end of it, and there is some portion of the other end I don't know so well",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",108
"109","33513. Is the population of the island falling off?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",109
"110","—It is decreasing.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",110
"111","33514. Was there a much larger population in Tyree in old times than now ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",111
"112","—Yes; there was once about 4000 people, and now it is short of 3000.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",112
"113","33515. Is it the case that half the island at least is in the hands of a few large tacksmen ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",113
"114","—Probably there is about half the island.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",114
"115","33516. Can you name the large tacks?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",115
"116","—There are some of these large farms that have crofters still within their bounds, but a considerable portion of the old boundary of the township has been added to the tack.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",116
"117","33517. Name those that have no crofters upon them?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",117
"118","—Scaranish, Baliepheatrish, Cornaigmore, Hough, Grianal, Hynish, Cruaidhghoirtean,",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",118
"119","Crosspool, Reef. There are several others where the place was only partially cleared and a large tack formed of the portion that was cleared, and a few of the crofters stud remain on the outskirts of the place.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",119
"120","33518. Upon the various tacks you have enumerated, how many people may be living now ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",120
"121","—I don't know that there is more than a family on each farm.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",121
"122","33519. Is it the fact then that of these large tacks six of them are held by three people ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",122
"123","—Yes.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",123
"124","33520. I want to know the position of those tenants—are they Tyree people ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",124
"125","—Two of them are natives of Tyree.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",125
"126","33521. Where did the others come from ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",126
"127","—The factor has two, Mr M'Quarrie has two, and Mr Barr has two.""",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",127
"128","33522. Are these people resident on their farms ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",128
"129","—Yes, they are resident in one of the places.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",129
"130","33523. What is the name of the present factor's farms ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",130
"131","—Hough, Hylipool or Cruaidhghoirtean.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",131
"132","33524. Were there a great number of people at various times working these nine possessions you have referred to ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",132
"133","—Some of those places were cleared before my recollection, some since. I live upon one end of the island, and could not tell the population, but there are others coming after me who can.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",133
"134","33525. Can you speak generally whether the removal of these people benefited those of the small crofters who were left behind ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",134
"135","—In some of the townships that was the case; they were the better of it; but in the great majority of them they were nothing the better of it; the cleared lands were added to or made into tacks.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",135
"136","33526. Are the crofters in your position worse off to-day than they used to be?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",136
"137","—Yes, we are; and the reason is that we pay higher rents, and the crofts are not so good as they used to be in the days of our fathers.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",137
"138","33527. Did the system of creating large farms in this way benefit in any degree, directly or indirectly, the crofter class ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",138
"139","—I think it was greatly to their loss, because some of those who were removed were added in and crowded upon the small crofters, and their places made less.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",139
"140","33528. May it be stated with truth that of the total population of Tyree nearly the whole of them are situated upon one half of the island ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",140
"141","—That is the truth, according to my judgment.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",141
"142","33529. Are the lands that are under tack of a better class, both arable and pastoral, than the lands in possession of the crofters ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",142
"143","—Well, perhaps it generally may be said to be better laud, but anyhow it looks very much better, because a great portion of it is not under cultivation, and therefore the pasture is good, and the portion of it that is arable can be cultivated upon a better system, and yields better crops, than we in our small crofts are able to raise.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",143
"144","33530. Is there a good deal of land that was once under cultivation now in the big tacks, and not cultivated at all ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",144
"145","—Yes, I can tell you some of those townships out of which the people were sent away.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",145
"146","33531. Mention them?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",146
"147","—Out of Scaranish went ten crofters. Then there is another tack not named before, Baugh, where some crofters still remain; five crofters were sent out of it. Another place that was added on to the farm of Balliepheatrish, eight crofters were sent from it. It was called Kennoway. Out of Hylipool twenty-six crofters were removed and twenty-one cottars. There were nine crofters and three cottars cleared from Balephuil, and this portion added on to the farm of Hynish. Those four crofters were removed from a piece of land which was given to the British Sea-weed Company. There is another tack, Manal, where there is still crofts, but twenty-nine crofters were removed from a portion of it that is a large farm now.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",147
"148","33532. You said you bought a lot of meal last year; where did you buy it ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",148
"149","—Chiefly from Glasgow.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",149
"150","33533. Did you use to produce much more meal than you do now ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",150
"151","—In old times we used to send to the mill almost as much as would feed the family, in many cases where now we do not send a grain. ",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",151
"152","33534. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",152
"153","—Was the land from which the four crofters were removed for the British Sea-weed Company the piece next",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",153
"154","to the quay at Balephuil spoken of by Donald M'Dougall ?",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",154
"155","—No.",560,"John Mcfadyen","Argyll, Tyree",155
