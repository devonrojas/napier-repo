"8","19754. Who is your landlord?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",8
"9","—Major Cameron. I am in the same position as the man who has just been examined. I am in want of",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",9
"10","scathold. It was taken away, and they put £1 upon the rent; they took away the scathold, and never took off the £1.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",10
"11","19755. How many sheep were kept upon the scathold belonging to your croft formerly?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",11
"12","—They kept sheep more or less; perhaps fifty or sixty sheep, and some maybe had fewer.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",12
"13","19756. Did your father in his time keep about forty sheep?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",13
"14","—He kept about twenty sheep, but some people had more.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",14
"15","19757. When the ground for those twenty sheep was taken away, he had no reduction of rent, but, on the contrary, there was £1 put upon the rent?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",15
"16","—There was £1 put upon the land when Mr Walker came and looked over the scathold; he raised the rent £1 on account of the stock picturing, and then he took away the scathold, and the £1 was never ",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",16
"17","taken off. ",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",17
"18","19758. On your own croft, what stock do you keep?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",18
"19","—Three cows and six ponies. ",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",19
"20","19759. No sheep?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",20
"21","—No sheep.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",21
"22","19760. Have you a good house?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",22
"23","—Yes, very good; it has just been repaired.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",23
"24","19761. What is your rent?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",24
"25","—£4 altogether.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",25
"26","19762. Why is your rent £4, while a neighbour who has the same stock pays £5?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",26
"27","—The ponies that I have I am obliged to other people for letting them go upon their land outside.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",27
"28","19763. When did you receive intimation that this meeting was to be held here?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",28
"29","—I received the intimation at the telegraph office on Saturday or Sunday sometime.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",29
"30","19764. Was it on Saturday or Sunday?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",30
"31","—I could not say which. I heard on the afternoon of yesterday that you were to be here to-day.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",31
"32","19765. But you think that the telegraphic intimation arrived on Saturday or Sunday?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",32
"33","—Yes, either Saturday or Sunday.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",33
"34","19766. Who was it informed you that the meeting would be here today ?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",34
"35","—Mr Sanderson, the postmaster, told me yesterday.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",35

"37","—About three hours.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",37

"39","—When were you chosen to represent the grievances of the people?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",39
"40","—Last Monday. It was represented then that you would not be here until the 20th.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",40
"41","19769. Who told you that?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",41
"42","—It was the directors of the place, the minister and two or three others.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",42
"43","19770. Did he say to you how he had heard?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",43
"44","—No, it was reported you were to be on the 20th at Balta Sound.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",44
"45","19773. How many people were at the meeting when you were elected?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",45
"46","—About twenty people.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",46
"47","19772. Were they all tenants of Major Cameron?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",47
"48","—Yes, and other proprietors.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",48
"49","19773. What others?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",49
"50","—Dr Paul.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",50
"51","19774. Who else?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",51
"52","—The Earl of Zetland.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",52
"53","19775. Are there any other proprietors in North Yell who have crofter tenants?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",53
"54","—Yes, there are different people, but these are the big proprietors.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",54
"55","19776. How many are big proprietors?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",55
"56","—Those who have a dozen farms, and so on.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",56
"57","19777. How many of those are there ?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",57
"58","—Three, I think —Dr Paul, Major Cameron, William Paul, and the Earl of Zetland.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",58
"59","19778. The two delegates from North Yell are both from the same property; do you know why there were no delegates from the property of the Earl of Zetland's and Dr Paul's property?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",59
"60","—I do not know.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",60
"61","19779. Do you think they have no grievances?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",61
"62","—Yes, but they are all busy at the fishing.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",62
"63","19780. But why are the tenants of these proprietors all fishing, and the tenants of Major Cameron at home?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",63
"64","—This other man who is along with me is at home, and I was at the fishing; but they let me off, so that I might come along with him.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",64
"65","19781. But why were not the delegates chosen from different properties, as would be most natural,—one from the Earl of Zetland's, one from Dr Paul's, and one from Major Cameron's?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",65
"66","—That would have been much better, but likely enough it was overlooked.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",66
"67","19782. What are the grievances of the other properties?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",67
"68","—The grievance on Dr Paul's property is that he won't repair their houses.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",68
"69","19783. And what is the grievance on the Earl of Zetland's property?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",69
"70","—I think he has come to pretty fair terms with them; there is no grievance. ",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",70
"71","19784. The principal grievance is what you and your neighbour have stated?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",71
"72","—Yes, the want of scathold.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",72
"73","19785. Professor Mackinnon.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",73
"74","—What about the blowing away of the land, of which the other witness spoke about to-day?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",74
"75","—That is the northwest wind, which brings the sand in and made the place all waste, and the sea has got possession of what was fertile land.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",75
"76","19786. Why don't you sow it with bent?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",76
"77","—The people may not be up to that.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",77
"78","19787. Is there no bent at all?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",78
"79","—Maybe a very little.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",79
"80","19788. Does that keep down the blowing?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",80
"81","—Yes, but the sea has got possession; it runs in over the land more than it did formerly.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",81
"82","19789. What fishing do you chiefly engage in at Cullivoe?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",82
"83","—Herring fishing now.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",83
"84","19790. Have you a good harbour?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",84
"85","—Very good. But there is no season there; we fish here at Unst, at Uyea Sound.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",85
"86","19791. Do you fish at the mouth of the Blue Mull Sound?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",86
"87","—Yes, at the west side of the island.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",87
"88","19792. Have you big boats?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",88
"89","—Yes, we have got none of our own, but we hire them and fish on the half-catch system.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",89
"90","19793. You are one of a number who have a boat?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",90
"91","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",91
"92","19794. What is the crew?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",92
"93","—Seven of us.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",93
"94","19795. And you work upon the half-catch system?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",94
"95","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",95
"96","19796. Who is the curer?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",96
"97","—William Paul.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",97
"98","19797. Is that the proprietor you spoke of?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",98
"99","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",99
"100","19798. You give the fish to him?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",100
"101","—Yes, he owns the boat, and we give him the fish, and we get half the fish for our trouble.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",101
"102","19799. And he keeps the boat in working order?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",102
"103","—Yes, he keeps the boat in working order, and gets half the fish",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",103
"104","19800. How long does the fishing last?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",104
"105","—Till September.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",105
"106","19801. Have you given up the cod and ling fishing?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",106
"107","—Yes, we gave it up on 12th June.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",107
"108","19802. But you were at that fishing before that date?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",108
"109","—Yes, from the month of March.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",109
"110","19803. What do you do from September to March?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",110
"111","—Just work at the land through the winter, and repair the fishing material; and when it is weather good enough to enable us to go off to the fishing, we go in four-oared boats round the shore.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",111
"112","19804. You cannot go to the deep sea fishing in winter?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",112
"113","—No, the farthest is a mile.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",113
"114","19805. What fish do you get there?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",114
"115","—Cod principally.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",115
"116","19806. But not in large quantities?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",116
"117","—No, about 1 or 1½ cwt. in a day.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",117
"118","19807. Does the curer supply you with stores?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",118
"119","—Yes, we have dealt with him this while back; but now the Scotch curers are coming into the place, they are getting their eyes opened.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",119
"120","19808. Do the Scotch curers bring stores?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",120
"121","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",121
"122","19809. And when you have a Scotch curer you get stores from him?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",122
"123","—If you have no money, your curer has to supply you.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",123
"124","19810. How often do you settle with the curer?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",124
"125","—Once a year, when the fishing is done—about Martinmas.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",125
"126","19811. And how do you settle the price about the herring?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",126
"127","—We get £1 a cran from the 1st of August—for 250 crans we get £1 a cran, and for any over that we get 14s. a cran.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",127
"128","19812. Up to the 1st August your arrangement is that you have £1 a cran?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",128
"129","—We have from the start 150 crans at 15s., then for any above that 14s. to 1st August; and then we get £1 for 250 crans; and for any beyond that quantity 14s. if we get that many. ",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",129
"130","19813. When is this arrangement made—before you commence the fishing?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",130
"131","—Yes, before.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",131
"132","19814. Is there any bounty?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",132
"133","—No, not for us, because we are not able to buy a boat.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",133
"134","19815. It is a long fishing season?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",134
"135","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",135
"136","19816. What do you consider a good fishing in the season with one of these big boats and seven of a crew?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",136
"137","—300 crans is considered a very good fishing, but of course they sometimes make more than that.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",137
"138","19817. Do you expect to make more than that this year?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",138
"139","—We cannot tell. We have got 100 crans already, and we may get 300 or 400 or 500 more, and perhaps not 100.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",139
"140","19818. And the arrangement is made before the fishing season begins?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",140
"141","—Before it commences we get a written agreement to that effect, so that it cannot be broken.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",141
"142","19819. And does that carry with it also the obligation to purchase from the curer—- that you are to procure your stores from him?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",142
"143","—No, you don't require to take stores from the curer unless you like.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",143
"144","19820. But, unless you have money, you must?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",144
"145","—Yes, and of course at his price.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",145
"146","19821. Because you could not get them anywhere else?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",146
"147","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",147
"148","19822. So that to the one who has no money it is virtually an obligation?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",148
"149","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",149
"150","19823. And the settlement is made at the Martinmas term every year?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",150
"151","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",151
"152","19824. What is the arrangement about the cod and ling fishing; how are the prices fixed?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",152
"153","—At the same time as the herring fishing —the new year before the season begins.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",153
"154","19825. And what price is fixed for them?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",154
"155","—We get 7s. 6d. for cod, 8s. 6d. for ling, 5s. for tusk, and 10s. for halibut, per cwt.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",155
"156","19826. Do they salt the halibut?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",156
"157","—They ice them. We get 10s. for them up to the 6th May.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",157
"158","19827. What market are they sent to?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",158
"159","—Birmingham and Leeds and London.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",159
"160","19828. Halibut and turbot are different fish?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",160
"161","—Scotch people call them halibut, but we call them turbot.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",161
"162","19829. Is it a round fish or a longish fish?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",162
"163","—It is long.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",163
"164","19830. Do you get very heavy halibut?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",164
"165","—Yes, pretty heavy —upwards of a cwt.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",165
"166","19831. And ling is 8s. 6d. a cwt, cod 7s. 6d., tusk 5s., and halibut 10s. ?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",166
"167","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",167
"168","19832. Halibut goes in ice and the others are salted?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",168
"169","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",169
"170","19833. You just give the fish to the curer?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",170
"171","—Yes; we have nothing to do but take off the heads, and in the case of turbot we don't even do that.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",171
"172","We do not split up the fish.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",172
"173","19834. What do you do with the heads?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",173
"174","—We use them for our own purposes. We get the fish, and take off the head.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",174
"175","19835. Sheriff Nicolson.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",175
"176","—Who gets the liver?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",176
"177","—We keep that for our own purposes, or the curers buy them.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",177
"178","19836. And the sound?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",178
"179","—They buy the sound.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",179
"180","19837. Professor Mackinnon.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",180
"181","—The whole of that belongs to you?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",181
"182","—Yes, the liver and head, but not the sound",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",182
"183","19838. You take nothing to do with the cleaning and drying?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",183
"184","—Nothing whatever.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",184
"185","19839. And is that arrangement all over the country with respect to the fixing of the prices ?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",185
"186","—I believe it is; of course, I could not say as to Scotch curers. They give better prices to a man who has a boat of his own. Perhaps they have a better advantage. But I can only speak from my own experience, and I have told you what our curer gives.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",186
"187","19840. Would you prefer to have a boat of your own?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",187
"188","—Oh yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",188
"189","19841. Are there many of the crews in the place who are able to have a boat of their own?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",189
"190","—No, not many; there is just one crew who have been able to get a boat of their own.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",190
"191","19842. Do you consider the big boat better than the old sixern of the country?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",191
"192","—Yes; they may be mere expensive, but there would not be so much loss of life as with the old boats.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",192
"193","19843. Are they better able to live in a wilder sea?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",193
"194","—Yes, very much; the small boats were merely skiffs.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",194
"195","19844. But they were good sea boats?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",195
"196","—Yes, but there is no mistake a big boat would live where a small boat would not.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",196
"197","19845. Is the price you mentioned for herring about the usual price going in the place?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",197
"198","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",198
"199","19846. You fix the price of the herring and you fix the price of the cod and ling; and the price of herring is 15s?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",199
"200","—From the 6th of June to the 1st of August.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",200
"201","19847. And after that £1 for 250 crans?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",201
"202","—Yes; and perhaps you might get that in two weeks; and if you got more you got 14s. a cran.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",202
"203","19848. For the over-catch before or after the 1st August, 14s.?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",203
"204","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",204
"205","19849. After the 1st August you got 20s. for 250 crans, and the overcatch after that is 14s.?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",205
"206","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",206
"207","19850. If you got the 250 crans in two or three weeks, you would get 14s. as long as you fished after that?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",207
"208","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",208
"209","19851. The over-catch is always the same, 14s.?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",209
"210","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",210
"211","19852. And that price is settled in the beginning of the year?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",211
"212","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",212
"213","19553. Is the fish after the 1st August considered more valuable or less?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",213
"214","—They are more valuable —they are full; they are considered to be in their prime.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",214
"215","19554. And cure better?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",215
"216","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",216
"217","19555. The season gets colder?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",217
"218","—They are considered better anyhow.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",218
"219","19856. Is that the best period of the fishing after the 1st of August?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",219
"220","—Generally the best; they consider the herring at their best.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",220
"221","19857. Do you look for a good fishing this year?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",221
"222","—We expect so.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",222
"223","19858. There is plenty of fish about?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",223
"224","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",224
"225","19859. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",225
"226","—Have you got any lease from Major Cameron?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",226
"227","—No.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",227
"228","19860. Is it a thing quite unknown for small crofters?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",228
"229","—No; some of them have them; two of Dr Paul's tenants have.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",229
"230","19861. Are there any leases on Major Cameron's property among the crofters?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",230
"231","—I could not tell you; none that I know of. ",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",231
"232","19862. I asked the previous witness how many crofters —heads of families —had the same cause of complaint as himself, and he said, perhaps between twenty or thirty —can you tell me?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",232
"233","—No; I do not think there are that many in North Yell.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",233
"234","19863. Are some of these upon other estates, or are they all upon the Cameron property?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",234
"235","—No, they are upon other estates.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",235
"236","19864. Have there been any small tenants or crofters removed altogether out of North Yell within the last twenty or thirty years?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",236
"237","—Yes, whole towns have been laid in sheep pasture.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",237
"238","19865. Can you mention any large sheep farms that were once occupied by crofters?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",238
"239","—Yes, Westa Firth.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",239
"240","19866. To whom does that belong?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",240
"241","—Major Cameron. ",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",241
"242","19867. Any other?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",242
"243","—Kirkabusta, on the Cameron property also.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",243
"244","19868. Any other?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",244
"245","—Windhouse, in Mid Yell. ",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",245
"246","19869. Any others in North Yell?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",246
"247","—Granister and Garth. That is all in one enclosure now ; there are fences dividing it. ",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",247
"248","19870. How many people may have been upon these four places?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",248
"249","—There were a good lot; pretty nearly twenty houses on Westa Firth alone.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",249
"250","19871. You are not sure about the others?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",250
"251","—No, but that is the biggest place.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",251
"252","19872. Did you know any of the people yourself?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",252
"253","—No, I was too young.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",253
"254","19873. Did you hear your father or other people speaking about them as people pretty well off?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",254
"255","—Yes, they were well off; they had plenty of scathold and sheep.[see Appendix A. LI]",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",255
"256","19874. What became of them?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",256
"257","—They all removed; some went to other countries and some removed to other farms. They had to go one here and one there. 1 could not say where they went to.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",257
"258","19875. But some of them had to leave North Yell altogether?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",258
"259","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",259
"260","19876. Who is the tenant of that big sheep farm just now?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",260
"261","—There is no tenant but the shepherd.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",261
"262","19877. Is it in the proprietor's hands?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",262
"263","—Yes, so far as I know.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",263
"264","19878. And there is only one shepherd?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",264
"265","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",265
"266","19879. Were there pretty good houses upon these farms?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",266
"267","—Yes, they are very good; Major Cameron has very good houses upon his property.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",267
"268","19880. The houses belonged to those people who were put away?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",268
"269","—I believe so; but they are all down now.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",269
"270","19881. Were they all built of stone?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",270
"271","—Yes, all built of stone.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",271
"272","19882. Do you agree with the preceding witness, that the loss of the sheep was a great loss to the crofters?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",272
"273","—Yes, it was a considerable loss.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",273
"274","19883. What use did you make of the sheep —what purposes were they devoted to?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",274
"275","—They made clothes at home; they spun wool with yarn, and it was woven with machines which they had for the purpose in Shetland.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",275
"276","19884. Was the carcase made use of?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",276
"277","—It was eaten.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",277
"278","19885. At what age?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",278
"279","—Three or four years of age; the wethers were generally used at that age and the ewes older.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",279
"280","19886. Were these sheep generally eaten by the crofters themselves, or were they sold?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",280
"281","—Generally eaten, because the prices were low, and they thought it better to eat them than to sell them.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",281
"282","19887. What have the crofters now for food instead of these sheep?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",282
"283","—Nothing, unless a pig.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",283
"284","19888. Is there anything to prevent your getting some of that scathold as before?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",284
"285","—I don't see any reason why they should not give us a little of it",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",285
"286","19889. Are you willing to pay a fair rent for it?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",286
"287","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",287
"288","19890. Mr Cameron.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",288
"289","—You stated that some grievances, of which you or your neighbour complained, existed upon other estates; but, as I understood you before, you said there was no grievance upon other properties except that Dr Paul did not keep the houses in proper order. Which of the two statements is correct?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",289
"290","—The correct one is that the tenants upon Dr Paul's property have a little scathold, and Major Cameron's tenants have none.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",290
"291","19891. Does the grievance of which you and your neighbour complain on Major Cameron's property extend to the estates of auy of the other proprietors?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",291
"292","—No, they all have a little scathold.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",292
"293","19892 Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",293
"294","—The other proprietors have given them a little scathold, whereas Major Cameron has given none?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",294
"295","—That is it",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",295
"296","19893. Mr Cameron.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",296
"297","—But you stated that the other tenants had no grievance except that of the houses on Dr Paul's property?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",297
"298","—Yes; undoubtedly they do require more scathold, if they would only give it to ' them.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",298
"299","19894. The Chairman.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",299
"300","—When you settle with the fish-curer, if the balance is in your favour, are you in the habit of getting the balance paid to you in money?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",300
"301","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",301
"302","19895. It does not remain on his books to your credit?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",302
"303","—No; the cash is paid the night you settle.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",303
"304","19896. Is money frequently paid—is it often the case that there is a balance due to the fishermen ?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",304
"305","—In general, the fishermen are due money to the curers.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",305
"306","19897. But, still, in some cases they have money to get?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",306
"307","—Yes, in a good many cases they have a little to get. They are getting better on now; the big boats get more money. Twenty years ago Shetland was very poor.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",307
"308","19898. Is there any complaint among the fishermen an account of the prices charged by the fish-curers, or is it believed that the prices are generally fair?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",308
"309","—The prices have been fair within the last five or six years. Before that the curers did not give fair prices, because the people could not make a better of it.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",309
"310","19899. Supposing one of your neighbours or yourself was able to buy a boat, and did not require the assistance of the fish-curer; would you then be allowed to fish as you pleased, and to sell the fish to anybody you liked?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",310
"311","—Oh, yes; they would not hold you to fish to them if you could purchase a boat for yourself. You could go to any curer you liked and get privilege and bounty too.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",311
"312","19900. And the proprietor would not molest you on account of that, but would allow you to remain in your croft?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",312
"313","—Yes; at any rate none of Major Cameron's tenants would be disturbed on that account. He has let them fish wherever they liked.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",313
"314","19901. What bait do you use for the long line deep sea fishing?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",314
"315","—Herring.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",315
"316","19902. Can the herring be caught all the year round for bait?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",316
"317","—-Yes; when you don't catch herring you don't set lines.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",317
"318","19903. Is there any artificial bait used?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",318
"319","—The small boats use musselbait but the large boats don't.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",319
"320","19904. You have no complaint to make about the bait?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",320
"321","—No; they always get some bait if they want it.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",321
"322","19905. When the proprietor himself—-like Dr Paul—is also a fish-curer, the tenants are expected to fish for him?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",322
"323","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",323
"324","19906. And do they actually fish for him?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",324
"325","—I think he does not compel them, if they have a boat of their own.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",325
"326","19907. If they had a boat of their own they could go where they liked, and he would not complain?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",326
"327","—No, because he has no fishing boats, but merely the boat of another proprietor. If you have a boat of your own, you can go where you get the best price for the fish.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",327
"328","19908. On the whole, as matters stand now, is there any great complaint about the system of supplying goods, or as to the relations between the fishermen and curer—are there complaints, or are they all pretty well off?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",328
"329","—I think they are all pretty well satisfied. The curers give their goods pretty cheap, supposing you don't have money to pay for them until the fishing is out.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",329
"330","19909. Are things better now than they used to be?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",330
"331","—Considerably better. Even twenty years back, in my mind, the people were very poor; and within the last half-dozen years they have got considerably up. People from the South, and curers, have come and given good prices for fish, and of course the curers in Shetland have to give the same as the Scotch curers. ",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",331
"332","19910. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",332
"333","—Is there considerable competition amongst curers themselves?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",333
"334","—No; I believe every one just gives what he thinks he can pay; generally, however, they have some such agreement as we have.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",334
"335","19911. Have you ever received money from a curer?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",335
"336","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",336
"337","19912. At the settlement, when a balance was due, you got the cash?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",337
"338","—Yes, on the night of the settlement.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",338
"339","19913. You stated that some of the crofters had leases on Dr Paul's property?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",339
"340","—Yes, these are the ones I know, and there may be some of whom I don't know.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",340
"341","19914. Are those who have leases more inclined to improve their land than those who have no leases?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",341
"342","—Yes, they are, because if they improved the land, perhaps, when they had no leases, they might be turned out next day and the croft taken from them; indeed, if they improved the ground, the ground was taken from them.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",342
"343","19915. Do you know the length of lease on Dr Paul's ground?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",343
"344","—No, I do not know.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",344
"345","19916. Professor Mackinnon.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",345
"346","—You mentioned one proprietor who is a curer—Dr Paul—is it the case that the tenants there fish for that curer only?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",346
"347","—Yes, they fish for him, but if they had a boat he would not hinder them from going to any other curer they liked.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",347
"348","19917. How many of them are there under that curer?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",348
"349","—Not many; he has not many tenants.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",349
"350","19918. Are there any who do not fish to him?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",350
"351","—No, they all fish to him.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",351
"352","19919. And is that a general practice when the proprietor is a curer",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",352
"353","—Yes, if he gives them as good a bargain as others.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",353
"354","19920. When the boat is their own they can go to where they please?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",354
"355","—Yes, where they can make the best bargain.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",355
"356","19921. But very few have boats of their own?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",356
"357","—Yes, very few; just two in North Yell.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",357
"358","19922. So that, as a matter of fact, people just fish to the proprietor?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",358
"359","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",359
"360","19923. Supposing the proprietor to be a curer, and that you were working on the half-catch system, how would the price of the fish be settled?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",360
"361","—Just the same.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",361
"362","19924. Who would settle it?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",362
"363","—The proprietor; and if you had any money to get he would give it to you.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",363
"364","19925. You would have no voice in settling it?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",364
"365","—No.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",365
"366","19926. Unless the boat is your own, you have no voice in settling the price?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",366
"367","—No, they give the general price of the country.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",367
"368","19927. And it is growing more and more the practice that fishermen are clear at settling time than they were in the past?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",368
"369","—Yes, they are improving greatly.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",369
"370","19928. Are there beach boys for drying cod and ling?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",370
"371","—Yes.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",371
"372","19929. Is it the practice for them, when they are of tender age, to open au account with the curer and take supplies?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",372
"373","—Yes; their parents are poor, and they have to go and work for themselves.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",373
"374","19930. They have a separate account for themselves, no matter how young?",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",374
"375","—Yes, if they can only work.",352,"Donald Moar","Unst, Baltasound",375
