"2","—I have the utmost readiness in repeating the assurance I gave before, that the people here may speak, freely and fully, anything they think proper without any fear of any kind.]DONALD O'HENLEY, Crofter and Fisherman, North Loch Boisdale (about 56)—examined.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",2
"3","10991. The Chairman.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",3
"4","Have you been freely elected a delegate by the people of North Loch Boisdale ",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",4
"5","—Yes.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",5
"6","10992. How many people were present?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",6
"7","—Over twenty.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",7
"8","10993. Have you got a statement to make on the part of the people?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",8
"9","—It is about forty years since I was removed from the place where I was well off.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",9
"10","10994. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",10
"11","What was the name of the place?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",11
"12","—Frobost. I was sent out on a small holding to Loch Boisdale, which is not sufficient to support me. This was in the time of Dr Macleod, then factor. He planted us in this place in North Loch Boisdale, and sent a servant to mark out the land. It was then agreed or promised to us that we would get sufficient land on which to  maintain one cow. Eight lots were put out here for those people who were removed from Frobost, and two of those from Frobost came here and got laud sufficient to maintain one cow. These two had each two of these lots. There were four lots remaining upon which one tenant was squatted or laid down, and they did not seem to have sufficient land to keep even one cow. My father informed me that he gave to this Dr M'Leod, the former factor, a horse to pay up arrears of rent amounting to 15s., and that he was to return the residue of the price, but he never received it.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",12
"13","10995. It is forty years since you left Frobost. Were you yourself tenant at Frobost, or was your father tenant there?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",13

"15","10996. How long is it siuce you held a lot of land yourself at North Boisdale ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",15
"16","—About thirty-six years.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",16
"17","10997. When you came to North Loch Boisdale, was the fishing good here ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",17
"18","—Fourteen years ago there was very good fishing here for some years. ",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",18
"19","10998. Was that the reason Dr M'Leod moved them here?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",19
"20","—No, that was not the reason. He was sending them here before the fishing was started at all,",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",20
"21","10999. What was Dr M'Leod's reason for changing your place ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",21
"22","—Clearings, to make up a tack for a Mr Chisholm that came from Moidart.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",22
"23","11000. Is that the tack of Frobost ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",23
"24","—It is now incorporated in the tack of Milton.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",24
"25","11001. Have you got the same land you had when you came here ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",25
"26","—Yes. ",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",26
"27","11002. No more ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",27

"30","—About eight acres.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",30
"31","11004. Is it all arable?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",31
"32","—We ourselves made it arable since we came.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",32
"33","11005. But it is all arable now?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",33
"34","—Yes.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",34
"35","11006. Have you any out-run pasture for cattle?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",35
"36","—No. Through the friendship of the neighbouring tacksman, we were allowed to send our cattle out to the moor, and we perform some service for this. Though I send my cattle out to this moor they are often chased with dogs, and they are often very much abused owing to stranger herds.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",36
"37","11007. What rent did you pay for the croft when you first succeeded to it ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",37

"41","11009. What are you paying now for it ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",41
"42","—£4, 10s. to-day for the same, the rent being raised on account of the good fishing that was obtained here.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",42
"43","11010. How long ago is it since it was raised ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",43
"44","—About fourteen or fifteen years ago.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",44
"45","11011. How long is it since the fishing ceased at this place?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",45
"46","—It is about five years since I provided anything by fishing—puttiug me to expense in gear.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",46
"47","11012. Is it that the fish have left the place?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",47
"48","—I think that the Barra fishing has spoiled this loch.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",48
"49","11013. When the fishing was good, did you think your lot dear at £4, 10s. ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",49
"50","—I think it was rather too dear when it would only maintain one cow. I think it was too dear a rent for it.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",50
"51","11014. How many days' labour do you pay for the pasture ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",51
"52","—Nine days for one cow. Two years ago we spoke to the present tacksman complaining that we paid too much,—nine days' labour for the one cow. The arrangement now is that we give six days' labour for one cow, and three days for a two-year-old. I suppose, before, the two-year-old was a follower.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",52
"53","Nothing was charged, but now we have three days' labour for a two-year old. ",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",53
"54","11010. How many barrels of potatoes do you plant in your croft ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",54
"55","—Some years seven or eight.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",55
"56","11016. What return do you get for that in an average year?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",56
"57","—I cannot tell.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",57
"58","11017. Do you know how much return of oats or barley you get for your seed ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",58
"59","—No, I cannot tell.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",59
"60","11018. Do you thresh the corn, or do you give it in the sheaf to the cow ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",60
"61","—Generally I thresh it, and I give the rest to the cattle.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",61
"62","11019. Do you keep a horse?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",62
"63","—I cannot keep a horse,—harrowing of land by our own labour without any horse. We tried a horse, aud could not keep her.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",63
"64","11020. How do you plough your land?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",64
"65","—With the cas-chrom or crooked spade. We might get a pair of horses to plough for us, if it was a good",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",65
"66","fishing season. Some of the crofters, perhaps, could afford to pay for them.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",66
"67","11021. How much of the croft do you turn over in a year ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",67
"68","—Not the half. They are anxious to leave as much for the cattle grazing as possible. If I had room I would cultivate more. ",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",68
"69","11022. How long do you leave the land in grass, in that case?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",69
"70","—Two years, three years, and sometimes over that. We cannot work with the crooked spade unless the land gets into a condition of lea.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",70
"71","11023. Do you think you get a less return now from your land than you used to get?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",71
"72","—Last year nothing at all out of it. It is getting poorer. The longer it is in lea—the older the land is—the better will be the crop.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",72
"73","11024. But if you are able to leave part out two or three or four years, is that not sufficient to ensure a good crop ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",73
"74","—Yes, much better ; but the place is so small that I cannot leave much out.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",74
"75","11025. What stock do you actually keep? Do you keep only one cow?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",75
"76","—I have three cows, one two-year-old and two stirks, and five or six sheep, but they are chiefly on the neighbouring tack.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",76
"77","11026. You are able to winter those from the produce of your croft?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",77
"78","—Some years I could maintain these.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",78
"79","11027. Do you pay to the tacksman the summering of all this stock?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",79
"80","—They are on the tack till the beginning of harvest, and then they have a little picking at home, but they must go on the tack some portions of each day.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",80
"81","11028. What I mean is : Is there one cow or one stirk kept wholly on the croft, or do they all go to the hill?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",81
"82","—Portions of them.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",82
"83","11029. You are paying for them to the tacksman?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",83
"84","—Yes, in labour.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",84
"85","11030. Do you know how much labour you have paid to the tacksman this last year?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",85
"86","—I don't know. The females about the house oftener did the labour than I did—particularly looking after peats, drying them, and so on.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",86
"87","11031. Does the tacksman take a woman's labour the same as a man's ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",87
"88","—The same.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",88
"89","11032. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",89

"91","—Over forty families.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",91
"92","11033. I understand your complaint, and the complain of the particular township you are in, is this, that you have no positive right to the hill ground. Is that so?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",92
"93","—That is the principal complaint—want of hill pasture and larger holdings altogether.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",93
"94","11034. Do you want an increase of arable land also ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",94
"95","—Yes, that is what we want.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",95
"96","11035. Is there ground upon ths tacksman's land that could be taken in adjacent to your lots?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",96
"97","—Yes.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",97
"98","11036. What is the name of the tacksman?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",98

"103","—Yes.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",103
"104","11039. Going back to the place you came from, you stated you were put out in order to accommodate Mr Chisholm from Moidart. How many families were put away by Dr M'Leod on account of Chisholm?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",104
"105","—I cannot give the number, but I know there were forty full crofts, and on some of these crofts there were two families.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",105
"106","11040. And were all these cleared off for the sake of Chisholm ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",106
"107","—Every one.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",107
"108","11041. Were those people distributed on other parts of the estate, or were some of them obliged to emigrate?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",108
"109","—He squatted them altogether upon other crofts.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",109
"110","11042. Who was the proprietor at the time? Was it Clanranald?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",110
"111","—The late Colonel Gordon.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",111
"112","11043. It was not in Clanranald's time?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",112
"113","—No. A few remained on the farm of Askernish, as servants of this Chisholm the tacksman, but they had",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",113
"114","no lands. ",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",114
"115","11044. Sheriff Nicolson.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",115
"116","Was there ever a better factor than Dr M'Leod in the country ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",116
"117","—He may have been a good man, but he did not do a gentlemanly turn in this matter.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",117
"118","11045. Was there ever a factor in these parts who was considered so kind to the people ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",118
"119","—I cannot say. He was not long in it after that.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",119
"120","11046. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",120
"121","Perhaps it was as well for the country that he was not ?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",121
"122","—I think so.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",122
"123","11047. The Chairman.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",123
"124","Have you anything else to say?",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",124
"125","—What will we do if the neighbouring tacksman stands to-day on his own march, and prevents our cattle going on his own moor? That is the question. I think the man is so gentlemanly that he will not make any difference to-morrow more than any other day, in respect of allowing the cattle to graze upon his tack. I have no particular grievance myself, but I know Ronald Macdonald, Loch Boisdale, has something of the nature of a grievance, and I would like if you would favour him with a hearing.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",125
"126","11048. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",189,"Donald O'Henley","South Uist, Lochboisdale",126
