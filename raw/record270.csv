"1","JOHN MATHESON, Crofter, Upper Barvas (68)â€”examined.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",1
"2","15205. The Chairman.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",2
"3","â€”Were you freely chosen a delegate?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",3
"4","â€”Yes. This is the memorial of the people of Upper Barvas:",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",4
"5","Changes. ",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",5
"6","â€”Before 1833 the crofter tenants were only twelve in number, and paying rent to the minister. About 1833 they and their land were separated from the minister, and their land divided into fourteen lots, at Â£46 rent. A double glebe was left to the minister by law, because of the inferiority of the soil, the same containing 30 acres of the crofters former land. The crofters' fourteen lots consisted of land much more inferior. A small piece of land was promised to them from off Lower Barvas for Â£ 5 additional rent; but it was never given, though the Â£5 are yearly paid by them, and also Â£5 by the Lower Barvas people. Now there are 24 crofter tenants in Upper Barvas, paying Â£58, 7s. (a sum made up of rent proper, and what was for some time kept separate, as 5s. road money and 1s. kain or hen money). School rates, poor rates, and road money are also paid. These different items may be seen in their receipts. ",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",6
"7","Holdings.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",7
"8","â€”Small, and inferior in soil, also rocky, and cannot be worked by horses; best land and pasture in hands of a select few. Some parts left uncultivated, because unprofitable. Stock. Sheep and cattle more in number than can be rightly kept from the people's anxiety to have, through their sale and theÂ  reservemen's and fishermen's earnings, the sum of money needed for rent and rates. The rent never reduced. The people cannot keep out of debt. The paupers are a burden on the crofters; but they delight in supplying them with the necessaries of life, besides paying poor rates. ",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",8
"9","Remedy.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",9
"10","â€”Land-holdings of such size and kind, arable and pasture, and on such conditions as may, with industry and thrift, afford proper and sufficient maintenance.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",10
"11","JOHN MATHESON, DONALD M'DONALD.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",11
"12","15206. How many people were there present at your election?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",12
"13","â€”A great many.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",13
"14","15207. How many people are there in Upper Barvas paying rent directly ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",14
"15","â€”Twenty-four.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",15
"16","15208. How many are there not paying rent directly?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",16
"17","â€”One.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",17
"18","15209. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",18
"19","â€”Does that include the paupers of which this paper speaks?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",19
"20","â€”There is no pauper staying in Upper Barvas except one girl, and perhaps also a young child.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",20
"21","15210. The Chairman.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",21
"22","â€”It saysâ€”'The paupers are a burden on the crofters.' Does that mean those two people ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",22
"23","â€”It is the paupers of the whole parish.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",23
"24","15211. Do you mean the poor people, or the people receiving parochial assistance ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",24
"25","â€”Paupers.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",25
"26","15212. Of the whole parish ",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",26
"27","â€”The whole parish.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",27
"28","15213. There are twenty-four families paying rent, and there were formerly twelve families before 1833. How has that increase taken place ? Have they been brought from other places, or are they the natural increase of the people of the soil ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",28
"29","â€”The people belonged to the place. Few if any outsiders were placed among us. In 1833 in addition to the twelve who were paying rent, there were two who did not pay rent at that time, and who were allowed crofts afterwards.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",29
"30","15214. Have you got a croft?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",30
"31","â€”Yes, a whole croft.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",31
"32","15215. What stock do you keep?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",32
"33","â€”I have too many for my croft this year. I have three cows, three young beasts, about twenty head of sheep, and one horse.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",33
"34","15216. What is your rent?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",34
"35","â€”Â£3, 6s., not including taxes.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",35
"36","15217. You said you have more stock than you should have. What is your summing?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",36
"37","â€”When I said I was overstocked this year, I meant that I had more stock than the croft can properly feed. I have no summing. That has gone out of fashion, and we are none the better for that.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",37
"38","15218. Are you obliged to buy fodder for your stock in winter?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",38
"39","â€”We would require to buy a great deal this year if we could only get it, but it was so scarce that we could hardly get it. We always buy more or less.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",39
"40","15219. How much do you buy on an average?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",40
"41","â€”In a good year we do not buy anything to speak of, but we get a good deal of their provender out of the shoreâ€”sea-ware.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",41
"42","15220. In an unsatisfactory year, how much do you buy?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",42
"43","â€”I would probably almost have to pay about Â£1 in order to maintain my present stock properly in an average year.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",43
"44","15221. You said you gave sea-ware to your animals. To which do you give the sea-ware?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",44
"45","â€”To the whole of them.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",45
"46","15222. Do the sheep eat sea-ware?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",46
"47","â€”No, not the sheep,â€”the cattle.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",47
"48","15223. Does the horse eat sea-ware?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",48
"49","â€”Yes.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",49
"50","15224. Do the cows and the horse thrive on the sea-ware, and what particular description of weed do they get?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",50
"51","â€”It is very good for them when they have other provender along with it It is tangle.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",51
"52","15225. Do you dry the sea-weed before giving it, or do you just give it to the beasts off the shore ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",52
"53","â€”Right off the shore, and they go away down to the sea themselves to eat i t Of course, the people bring it up for them too.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",53
"54","15226. We were told in another place that if the cattle got sea-weed they swooned. Have you observed anything of the kind here ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",54
"55","â€”Yes, and it sometimes kills them; but that is only at a certain time of the year. In the spring of the year we require to be particularly careful when they get this sea-ware lest it may kill them. I saw sixteen killed by the seaware one day; but it is only for a very short period of the year that there is that great danger, and we are very careful at that time.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",55
"56","15227. What do you think is the reason of its being poisonous at one time and useful at another?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",56
"57","â€”The cows are at all times very fond of this sea-ware, and when they get down to the shore and get an abundant supply they take too much; but when the people bring it home to them they regulate the supply to a moderate quantity. At the beginning of spring they are weaker, being worse fed and in worse condition than at any other time, and it is worse for them when they get a gorge of it",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",57
"58","15228. Is it good for cows in the way of making milk?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",58
"59","â€”Yes, it is very good, especially at this time of the year.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",59
"60","15229. What is the best food along with it?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",60
"61","â€”Straw. Potatoes, for example, are not so good along with it as straw is.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",61
"62","15230. Have you plenty of sea-weed?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",62
"63","â€”Yes, generally there is plenty, but sometimes we complain. There are some places better than others. jo nn",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",63
"64","15231. Axe you allowed to gather it freely on your own shore?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",64
"65","â€”Yes.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",65
"66","15232. Is any payment taken for it?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",66
"67","â€”No.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",67
"68","15233. Can you gather it on the shore of the tacksmen, if there are any tacksmen ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",68
"69","â€”The only tacksman in our neighbourhood is the minister of the parish, Mr Strachan, and he and we are upon very good terms, and we are quite free to go upon his foreshore and he upon ours to take seaware.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",69
"70","15234. You say that a small piece of land was promised to you from Lower Barvas for Â£5 additional rent. Why was that additional piece of land never given to you?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",70
"71","â€”In the days of John Munro Mackenzie there was a march between Lower and Upper Barvas, and he stated that Upper Barvas got more than its fair proportion of land. Our arable land was equal, but he assigned a certain portion of pasture land to Upper Barvas. This portion of pasture land we never got. He said that the rent of the property would require to be increased by Â£5 because of this additional bit of pasture land. That was done. The Â£ 5 was placed upon us, but the bit of land we did not get. It remained with Lower Barvas, which had it originally.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",71
"72","15235. Then, perhaps the people of Lower Barvas would not like to part with the ground ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",72
"73","â€”No, certainly not. They got no abatement of rent either.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",73
"74","15236. Would you like to take away ground from your neighbours who do not want to part with it ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",74
"75","â€”No; they never wanted to get any of our ground.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",75
"76","15237. Then what you ask for is increased holdings?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",76
"77","â€”We do not know where we can get more land. We leave that to people wiser in respect to such matters than we are.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",77
"78","15238. You can remember fifty years ago quite well. Do you think the people of Upper Barvas are poorer and worse off than they used to be fifty yean ago ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",78
"79","â€”They are not so well off now. It cannot be, with the number of people there.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",79
"80","15239. Are they worse dressed than they were then ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",80
"81","â€”I cannot very well answer the question. I remember that fifty years ago we were clothed with the wool and home-made cloth of our district. Instead of that they have to-day senseless rags that they buy here and there in other places. ",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",81
"82","15240. But I see the people all around me are well dressed and decently dressed ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",82
"83","â€”Yes, it is quite true, but they are clothed in their best to-day. After all, what is it worth beside a jacket or a coat of home-made cloth, or a pair of trousers of home-made cloth, which I saw in my time ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",83
"84","15241. Are the houses worse than they were in your time, or are they better ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",84
"85","â€”The houses are considerably better. I have myself built a poor house in many ways, but I have built two houses in my time, and it is superior to the house my father had. H my father's house had been better than it was, probably mine would be better than it is.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",85
"86","15242. What about your food ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",86
"87","â€”The food is not half so good. I heard one of the previous delegates speak to the same fact on that matter to-day.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",87
"88","15243. I have heard there are no public houses or places for the sale of liquor in the country except in Stornoway. Do you approve of that?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",88
"89","â€”I quite approve of that regulation. When there were licensed premises nearer me, I was tired enough of them.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",89
"90","15244. But you did not go there yourself?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",90
"91","â€”Yes, there was such a day when I used to frequent them, but even I gave it up entirely.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",91
"92","15245. Are there many temperance people now?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",92
"93","â€”I do not know. I never took the pledge myself, and I am not very sure that I ever regarded that mode of promoting temperance too high. If one who is satisfied in his own mind that it is a proper thing to do so, that is my idea of temperance.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",93
"94","15246. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",94
"95","â€”Are you able to sell anything off your croft ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",95
"96","â€”Nothing.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",96
"97","15247. Do you not sell a beast?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",97
"98","â€”Yes, we sell a stirk.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",98
"99","15248. What did you last sell, and when?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",99
"100","â€”Last October I sold two two-year-olds, and I am rather ashamed to tell the condition in which they were in the presence of gentlemen. I only got Â£5 for the pair of them.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",100
"101","15249. When do you expect to sell another one?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",101
"102","â€”Very soon. I must sell Supposing there were only two, necessity would compel me to sell one of them.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",102
"103","15250. Do you sell any sheep?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",103
"104","â€”I sell a few sheep now and again.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",104
"105","15251. What do you get for the sheep?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",105
"106","â€”Where there is no good pasture there can be no good mutton. We sell our two or three-year-old wedders from 12s. to 20s. I have seen 20s. got for them, but that is rare.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",106
"107","15252. Are these the only tilings that you can sell off the produce of the croft ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",107
"108","â€”I sell nothing else. In a very good year I once sold four barrels of potatoes, but it was an exceptionally good year.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",108
"109","15253. How much are you obliged to spend in a year in the purchase of meal and other necessaries for supporting your family ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",109
"110","â€”My family is now very small; they are scattered here and there ; but when they were gathered together I would consider Â£20 a very moderate allowance for",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",110
"111","what I had to purchase.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",111
"112","15254. Is there a scarcity of milk much more so than prevailed in former times?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",112
"113","â€”Yes, and of butter. We have lost the butter entirely of late in comparison with the day I have seen.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",113
"114","15255. Are you obliged to give your children tea now to make up to some extent for the loss of milk ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",114
"115","â€”Yes. I was the father of a family myself before I could distinguish between tea and coffee. The children now can distinguish between the two articles before they are four years of age. They are not at all so innocent in that respect as I was.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",115
"116","15256. Is your rent altered in any way since 1833 ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",116
"117","â€”It was raised. To begin with, there was that Â£5 of which I have already spoken, and then there was 6s. in the time of Munro imposed upon every crofter.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",117
"118","15257. For what purpose ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",118
"119","â€”For road money and hen money.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",119
"120","15258. It appears that the hens at first used to be delivered in the time of the Seaforths, but do you know how long it was dropped ; how long was there between the time they gave in the fowls and the time the money was paid ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",120
"121","â€”I cannot very well tell. I remember the time myself when the hens were being delivered, and the practice of payment commenced in Munro's time.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",121
"122","15259. Had the giving of the hens ceased so long that when the money was exacted it came upon the people as a new tax or new rent altogether?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",122
"123","â€”They looked upon it no doubt when it was first imposed upon them as a new imposition, but, although I myself was without any hen at the time, I remember when the old people used to say that they would prefer to pay the shilling rather than deliver the fowl.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",123
"124","15260. Do they still go to the shealings ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",124
"125","â€”Yes, regularly.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",125
"126","15261. How many go ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",126
"127","â€”Probably there will be two heads of cattle on an average going to the summer pasture from each house, and a female always accompanies them, but sometimes two neighbours may entrust the care of their cattle to one person. ",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",127
"128","15262. When do they send them ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",128
"129","â€”About this time. ",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",129
"130","15263. How long do they keep them there ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",130
"131","â€”Six weeks. ",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",131
"132","15264. Do the women stay all that time in the sheilings?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",132
"133","â€”Yes.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",133
"134","15265. Is the milk sent home, or do they make butter and cheese?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",134
"135","â€”The milk comes home every day.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",135
"136","15266. Is somebody sent for it?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",136
"137","â€”The milkman comes home every morning with the milk.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",137
"138","15267. How far is it?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",138
"139","â€”From four to six miles distant from the homestead.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",139
"140","15268. Do the women sleep in bothies?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",140
"141","â€”They sleep outside in the sheilings.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",141
"142","15269. Did your ever hear of an old custom of the people of the place to meet and go in a sort of procession singing a sort of chant when they went to the sheilings ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",142
"143","â€”I have heard something of that practice, but I am not able to give any correct opinion about it. I believe it must have been long ago.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",143
"144","15270. What is the tradition you have heard about it ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",144
"145","â€”They used to sing, but it.was not psalms; it was not the Psalms of David, whatever. They had some metrical composition.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",145
"146","15271. Do you think it was so long ago as to date from the times before they were Christians ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",146
"147","â€”I cannot say.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",147
"148","15272. Is there anybody in the place who has any recollection of such a thing ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",148
"149","â€”No.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",149
"150","15273. The Chairman.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",150
"151","â€”Do you remember a factor called Knox?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",151
"152","â€”Very well indeed. Everybody would know him. There was nobody in the whole island like him.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",152
"153","15274. Do you mean he was so good or so bad?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",153
"154","â€”I mean his personal appearance. He was a great, big, fat man.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",154
"155","15275. Did that factor exact a shilling for hen money?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",155
"156","â€”I remember perfectly well of the hens being delivered in his time, and I am inclined to believe that the practice continued during the whole time of his",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",156
"157","factorship.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",157
"158","15276. Did he exact a week's work from the people, and failing that, 5s. instead?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",158
"159","â€”Yes, the service was rendered in his time. I cannot remember the men who paid the 5s., but the service was pretty punctually rendered.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",159
"160","15277. Did you ever hear it said that pottery used to be made by the people in Barvas?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",160
"161","â€”Yes, I both heard and saw vessels of clay being made.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",161
"162","15278. What sort of vessels were they?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",162
"163","â€”All sorts. We have them here yetâ€”a good number of them. There is one person here that makes them yet.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",163
"164","15279. Do they make jars and dishes for milk and butter?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",164
"165","â€”No. She could not make jars with narrow necks, but she would make crocks for butter.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",165
"166","15280. Were they painted, or had they patterns upon them?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",166
"167","â€”I am not aware, but, as to the woman I speak of, some of her work was sent to Edinburgh, and gentlemen who came to the place used to hunt her up and get some of the work she did.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",167
"168","15281. Was this an art which they learned abroad, or was it an old traditional art in the place ?",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",168
"169","â€”Yes, in the days of my grandfather and great-grandfather these clay vessels were in most common use. I cannot accurately say, but my own belief is that this art was of native growth.",270,"John Matheson","Lewis, Barvas ",169
