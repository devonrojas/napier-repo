"13","—Gentlemen, Our first complaint was to be driven away from Lochshell forty years ago. The fire was drowned on the hearths by the officers of the estate. They were fined £50 sterling for not leaving the villages on the appointed day. The people of the two villages were put to a smaller village than either of the two they were driven from. When the people came to Crossbost they had a small village five miles from Crossbost for herding; it was taken from them, and rented to another man, and nothing taken off the rent of the village for it. Another piece of ground was taken from us at the end of the village, rented for £ 5 , 10s. and nothing taken off the rent of the village for that. Four new crofters were set at the end of the village, and paying rent to the estate, and nothing taken off the rent of the village.—Delegates for Crossbost, ALEXANDER MACKENZIE and DONALD MACKENZIE.",323,"Donald Mackenzie","Lewis, Keose",13
