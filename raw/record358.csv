"2","20269. The Chairman.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",2
"3","—Are you a proprietor?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",3
"4","—No; a factor.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",4
"5","20270. Do you occupy any land yourself?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",5
"6","—I do.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",6
"7","20271. Then I may say you are a factor and farmer?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",7
"8","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",8
"9","20272. You have no other factor?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",9
"10","—I am, in fact, lessee of the estate, too —lessee and factor. I pay a free rent to Mrs Edmonston for the",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",10
"11","estate of Buness.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",11
"12","20273. Have you been long resident in the island?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",12
"13","—All my life, with the exception of a few years.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",13
"14","20274. And engaged both as factor on estate management, and in fanning on your own account?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",14
"15","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",15
"16","20275. Have you had any other commerce,—as a fish-curer, for instance?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",16
"17","—Yes; I started business when twenty-one, as a fish-curer and general merchant. I continued that for eight or nine years, and then gave it up.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",17
"18","20276. You have heard what has been stated by the small tenants here to-day?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",18
"19","—I have.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",19
"20","20277. Is there any statement you wish to make in consequence of what you have heard?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",20
"21","—There are one or two statements I might make. When I heard the tenants were to come here to day, I drew up a statement which I shall read:",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",21
"22","Previous to about the year 1820, the land in Shetland was let in small crofts and the rents paid in kind",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",22
"23","—part in fish, butter, oil, and money. The lands were low rated, and the price of produce was also low, so that the proprietors looked for their rents out of the sales of what they got from the people. It sometimes happened that the price of Shetland produce was very low in the southern markets, and in such times the net rentals were very smalL The proprietors generally managed their own estates, compelling the men to fish for, and deliver to them, the whole of the produce, both of sea and land, and were thus fish-curers and merchants. In some cases, however, they let their properties to middlemen, or tacksmen as they were called, getting a slump sum in money, and allowing the tacksmen to make what profit they could out of the people, the tenants of course, being bound to fish for and deliver their produce to them. During last century the population was only about half what it is at present. There were few or no large farms, as the great object was to increase the number of fishermen, and thus the land was sub-divided into small lots; and there being little or no emigration, the population naturally increased very rapidly. Under this old system, the people were generally well to do, and there was little or no debt due on the land. The ground was well-cultivated and almost self-supporting; little or no meal was imported. As intercourse with the South became more frequent, and people began to know the prices of sea and farm produce, the old system engendered discontent, and, forgetting that if they were selling their produce cheap, they also had their farms at a nominal rent, the tenants called loudly for a fairer market value being put upon all. Between the years 1820 and 1830, or in some cases before that time, most of the proprietors had revalued their lands and given up the old system, allowing the people to fish for whom they chose, and sell their produce to the highest bidder, merely asking payment of the rents when they annually fell due at Martinmas. The result of this free trade was that innumerable shopkeepers sprang up, and the people were induced to barter their produce from hand to mouth, for luxuries which they could not afford, thus acquiring a taste for articles which superseded the coarser and healthier produce of their farms; the land was neglected, and refused to produce anything like its former increase. The home-spun and comfortable woollen clothing was superseded by the light and cold cotton textures of the present time, the native wool being made up into finer articles for the southern markets, and bartered for light clothing and eatables, and thus the people were neither fed nor clothed like their ancestors. The consequence of all this was that they got seriously into debt both to landlords and merchants, and one of the largest and first of the free trade proprietors emphatically declared that had he been a younger man, he would have put his ""shoulder to the wheel,"" and gone back to the old and paternal government of his estate, as the best suited at that time for both landlord and tenant. Up to 1867, the crofts on the Buness estate were mostly ""runrig;"" and in that season the whole property was carefully gone over and divided out in separate lots, so that each tenant got his farm by itself. At the same time each holding was valued at what was considered a fair money rent, and the tenants without exception all took their holdings and seemed satisfied. Up to this time the scatholds or hill ground were pastured by the people in common, aud it often happened that the principal stocks belonged to tenants of other proprietors, shopkeepers, and squatters. Those who were not Buness tenants were requested to remove their animals. A certain  proportion of the scatholds were enclosed and let out as sheep farms, but in nearly every case a portion next the town lands was reserved for the crofters. An attempt was then made to induce the people to take leases and improve their holdings, by breaking out more land draining, sub-dividing, and rotation of crops; but while many adopted a sort of rotation, and with the most marked benefit, others have not done so, and in all cases the leases were emphatically refused. Many would have taken them with a clause binding the proprietor, but leaving the tenant free to remove any year he chose; but this one-sided agreement was not granted, and so the crofts on the Buness estate are mostly all held on yearly tenancy. Almost contemporaneous with this rearrangement of crofts, came a run of good fishings and high prices for cattle of all kinds, and so the tenants have generally paid their rents with moderate regularity. Another help to this is the fact that since 1867 the breed of horned cattle has been greatly improved throughout the island. Previous to 1865, the poor rate was voluntary and entirely paid by the proprietors. In that year this rate alone rose to the enormous sum of 7s. in the pound of gross rental; this was owing to all the small proprietors, who hold about a fourth of the parish, refusing to pay their proportion, and in that year the rate fell on Lord Zetland, Garth, and Buness. This was found to be such a grievous burden, that it was resolved to adopt the Rowland Act of 1845 in its entirety, and the rates at the present time are 3s. 6d. for poor and Is. 6d. for school, levied half on proprietors and half on tenants. A large proportion of this rate goes to maintain six pauper lunatics in Montrose Asylum. The whole houses on the Buness estate are built and repaired by the proprietors without charging any interest or additional rent. An average Buness croft may; be stated at £5 rent, which consists of from five to ten acres of town land, a house, peat ground, liberty on the hill for ponies, cattle and sheep, and an average stock that may be kept on such a holding may be stated at three milk cows, two young cattle, three breed mares, and six to twelve ewes, besides pigs and poultry. Whilst many have this stock and more, there are no doubt many who do not have it; this is owing to a variety of circumstances, amongst which is inability to purchase a stock to start with. There has been no rise of rent on the Buness estate since 1867. In 1874-5 the islands were stumped by emigration agents from New Zealand, and a great many people were induced to take advantage of the assisted passages, and went out to that colony. Several of the Buness tenants were of the number, and in most cases each carried with him a clear sum of from £30 to £200 as the result of their savings here. In cases where townships were partially left vacant, several tenants were moved from one place to another and concentrated, in order that something might be made of a whole township, when nothing could be got out of a vacant portion. There is not a croft vacant at present on the estate. In 1867 it had 118 holdings, and at present there are 106. A great portion is expected for trust, in consequence of the new enterprise in fishing which has lately been started by South country as well as native curers. The small native boats are being fast superseded by larger decked ones, and many of the men are hiring themselves as hands in the larger boats.Men, women, aud children are all at present remuneratively employed, and the result is showing itself in many ways. The present rental of the Buness estate, as appearing in the valuation roll, includes sums of over £100 for interest on Government loans of money laid out on the estate. This goes to swell the rental, and is not actual rise of rent.—I prepared this statement hurriedly, and it may be to the point or not.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",23
"24","20278. You spoke of an improvement in the cattle; what was the nature of the improvement which has been effected —has it been an improvement in the native breed by selection, or has a new breed been introduced? ",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",24
"25","—It is a new cross breed; better breeders have been got",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",25
"26","20279. What is the cross which was used principally?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",26
"27","—Principally shorthorn with the Shetland, and it makes a most admirable cross.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",27
"28","20280. A direct cross between a shorthorn bull and a Shetland cow?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",28
"29","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",29
"30","20281. And it produces a good animal?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",30
"31","—Yes; an animal which, if well. fed, comes to be heavy and hardy at the same time.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",31
"32","20282. A good milker?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",32
"33","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",33
"34","20283. Has the improved breed extended to the small tenants, or is it in the hands of the small farmers?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",34
"35","—It has extended to the small tenants.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",35
"36","20284. Is there any export of the young cattle at one and two year old?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",36
"37","—A large export.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",37
"38","20285. What prices are they realising for the one and two year olds?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",38
"39","—I could not say—perhaps from £5 to £9.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",39
"40","20286. £5 for a stirk, and for two-year-olds up to £9?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",40
"41","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",41
"42","20287. What was the original price of a stirk and two-year-old of the old original breed?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",42
"43","—The price has been increasing during the last few years. A stirk is scarcely a saleable animal in Shetland —it is so small; but two and three year olds have been selling at from 40s. to 60s.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",43
"44","20288. Is this improved breed exclusively adopted all over?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",44
"45","—More or less in this island especially.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",45
"46","20289. And is it progressing?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",46
"47","—I should say so.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",47
"48","20290. How do they winter their improved cattle; do they stand out all the winter?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",48
"49","—No, they always house them.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",49
"50","20291. The native cattle go out all winter?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",50
"51","—All the Shetland cattle are housed.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",51
"52","20292. You mean really housed for several months?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",52
"53","—Oh, yes; from October until May all right, I daresay they are run out every good day for a few hours.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",53
"54","20293. What is given to them in winter?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",54
"55","—-Straw principally. ",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",55
"56","20294. Should that not increase the area of the arable cultivation?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",56
"57","—It ought to. ",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",57
"58","20295. And is there no increase in the area of arable cultivation?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",58
"59","—I don't think so; in very few cases. ",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",59
"60","20296. Is the corn which was originally threshed for consumption by the people now given without threshing to the cattle, or do they prepare as much for domestic consumption as ever they did?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",60
"61","—I think they thresh as much for domestic consumption as they used to do. I do not think in ordinary seasons they have to give the corn unthreshed to the animals.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",61
"62","20297. Is there an improvement in the ponies, or a greater demand, or is the demand falling off?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",62
"63","—There is a great demand for them, but there is no change in the breed. In fact they do not want a change, because they cannot be got small enough. The small ones always fetch the highest prices in the market.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",63
"64","20298. Is attention paid to the selection of the breeders?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",64
"65","—I don't think so. It may be by a few of the gentlemen who have pony farms; they may attend a little to selection; but I don't think there is any selection amongst the crofters. In fact, it is the ' halt and maimed ' that are kept for breeders.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",65
"66","20299. We have heard a good deal to-day of the withdrawal of the hillpasture from tenants, and the consolidation of them into sheep farms; has that been the practice upon Buness estate?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",66
"67","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",67
"68","20300. Has that been prejudicial to the condition of the small tenants?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",68
"69","—I don't think so at all.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",69
"70","20301. In the case of the withdrawal of the hill pasture, has there been any proportionate reduction of rent?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",70
"71","—No, because in all the cases where we enclosed hill pasture it was very extensive, and far more than",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",71
"72","our tenants could occupy. It was occupied by the tenants of other proprietors all over the island, and we, in almost every case, left some scathold for the tenants.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",72
"73","20302. Almost in every case?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",73
"74","—Almost in every case.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",74
"75","20303. And when none at all was left, in this exceptional case was a reduction of rent made?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",75
"76","—No, because it was the same year that the scatholds were enclosed that the rents were all gone over and equalised. They had never been looked after for perhaps fifty years, and in many cases they were reduced, and in other cases increased, in order to equalise them. I would find two men sitting in the same town and having the same quantity of ground and advantages, the one paying perhaps half as much as the other, that having arisen no doubt long ago by the demand for land.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",76
"77","20304. When the house of one of your small tenants becomes ruinous or dilapidated, he applies, I suppose, for repairs; in that case, is the expenditure in repairing the house entirely at the charge of the landlord?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",77
"78","—Entirely. About that man Robert Johnston, he applied to me last year saying that the roof of his house was bad. I sent a man, and had it partially repaired, because there was such a demand for labour on the island I could not get men to repair it. On Friday last I got a note from him, to say that the couples of his house were bad, and I am just waiting for a mason to go and get it repaired.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",78
"79","20305. In the case of repairing such a house, what amount of money expenditure does it imply to the proprietor?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",79
"80","—Often three years' gross rent, A new house will cost on an average about £20.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",80
"81","20306. Not more than £20?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",81
"82","—A new cottage.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",82
"83","20307. In the case of a cottage which costs £20, what is the description of building? Is it built with stone and lime?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",83
"84","—Stone and lime. Since I had anything to do with them, I have been building them with lime, because they stand better.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",84
"85","20308. Is it really possible to build a two-roomed cottage with stone and lime walls and a weather-tight roof for £20?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",85
"86","—Either a turf or thatch. The rafters are of wood, and then the turf is put upon the top, and straw over that.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",86
"87","20309. In the case of a house so built, does the tenant pay the first thatch?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",87
"88","—He does first the whole thatching; that is all he does.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",88
"89","20310. Does he also do the divisions in the inside of the house?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",89
"90","—We just build the walls of the house and put the roof on. The tenant puts in box beds, which make a division, and we have nothing to do with that.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",90
"91","20311. There are two chimnies in the house?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",91
"92","—Yes, in a new house, and windows and doors. We supply the doors.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",92
"93","20312. How many years' rental of the croft do you estimate it would cost?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",93
"94","—About four years' gross rental on an average; and that means about eight years, the landlord gets nothing, and his taxes will be well on to 10s. in the £.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",94
"95","20313. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",95
"96","—Have you been in charge of the property since 1867?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",96
"97","—Yes, and before that.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",97
"98","20314. Then it was under your charge when the scathold was taken off the crofters?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",98
"99","—Yes, it was.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",99
"100","20315. The principal complaint we have had to-day seems to be the loss of the scathold. Do you thiuk there is good ground for that?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",100
"101","—There may be in some cases, where the tenants have no scathold at all.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",101
"102","20316. But, on the Buness property, you think they have scathold, generally speaking?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",102
"103","—They have all, with two exceptions, sufficient for their arable land; of course, not to keep 200 or 300 sheep, as they used to do, but sufficient to run out young ponies and cattle, and a few sheep.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",103
"104","20317. But if they used to keep 200 or 300 sheep, won't they feel it to be a hardship to have lost that power?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",104
"105","—They do.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",105
"106","20318. It is an actual loss to them, because they pay the same rent as before?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",106
"107","—-In some cases they do, and in some cases more.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",107
"108","20319. But you have not taken into account, in their new rent, that they have not that power of grazing 200 or 300 sheep?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",108
"109","—No; we valued their croft and the privileges outside, and put on what we considered a fair thing for the man to pay. A man having six, eight, or ten of a family, and paying £3 to £5 of rent, would scarcely be supposed to live entirely on a croft of that size. He must work outside to supplement his living.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",109
"110","20320. Do the women make much money by knitting?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",110
"111","—They have made a good deal in years gone by.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",111
"112","20321. Have they a chance of doing so now?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",112
"113","—Not just now ; Shetland hosiery seems a drug in the market.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",113
"114","20322. There is no demand for it?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",114
"115","—I believe the merchants who have been buying it have great difficulty in selling it, and have stocks which they cannot dispose of. There is so much cheap woven stuff in the market, that people won't give the prices for hand-wrought shawls.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",115
"116","20323. Have they any difficulty in getting Shetland wool for their work?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",116
"117","—I think there is enough Shetland wool for the demand, and for coarser articles of underclothing; they buy a considerable quantity of Cheviot wool, of which we allow them—at least I do —to select the best fleeces at clipping. It is the same time; I get the same price for a fine fleece as for a coarse, and for many years I have been selling it at about Is. per lb., for the last four or five years at least.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",117
"118","20321. What does the Shetland wool sell at?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",118
"119","—I have a few Shetland sheep on the land, and I sell it at Is. 8d. per lb.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",119
"120","20325. Is that white or coloured wool?-",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",120
"121","—White; and 2s. for black.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",121
"122","20326. The yellow wool sells highest?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",122
"123","—I don't know; I have none of it.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",123
"124","20327. Mr Cameron.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",124
"125","—You stated that some of the scathold land was turned into sheep farms; where did the sheep farmers come from who took the land?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",125
"126","—I occupy two. ",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",126
"127","20328. Did any come from a distance?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",127
"128","—Mr Sievewright, writer, Lerwick, took one. ",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",128
"129","20329. Did they find houses on these places, or were houses built for them?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",129
"130","—We don't require a house. There is only a shepherd on the farm, and one of the old cottages did for him.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",130
"131","20330. And they just work it as a sheep farm?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",131
"132","—It was enclosed by the proprietor, and sub-divided, and he wrought it as a sheep farm.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",132
"133","20331. Is there any arable ground attached to these farms,—has the large tenant got arable ground along with the grazing ground?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",133
"134","—Yes; Mr Sievewright got a good deal of the crofters' arable land and it was all laid down in grass.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",134
"135","20332. Does he plough any of the land on the sheep farm now?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",135
"136","—No; he gave it up two or three years ago, and it is let to another tenant.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",136
"137","20333. Have any of the sheep to be wintered away?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",137
"138","—Well, a number of the blackfaced sheep have grass. The grey-faced lambs, from Leicester tups, are all sold; a few have pure blackfaced lambs, and they are kept for stock.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",138
"139","20331. But none of the pure blackfaced stock require to be sent away for wintering?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",139
"140","—No; they are wintered here, both ewes and wethers.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",140
"141","20335. And the scathold which remains to the crofters is equally good land with that which is now occupied by the sheep farmers?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",141
"142","—Yes, it is just a slice off it.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",142
"143","20336. If the land is sufficiently good to enable them to graze blackfaced ewes and Leicester tups, would not the remaining land be able to support a better class than the Shetland sheep?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",143
"144","—I should doubt the crofters being able to support that class of sheep, because in the case of Mr Sievewright and myself, we have old town lands, and keep the ewes with the cross lambs there, and the pure blackfaced sheep on the hill.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",144
"145","20337. Then this ground taken from the crofters was the best?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",145
"146","—No.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",146
"147","20338. Then why should not the crofters use what remains, the same as the sheep fanners does?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",147
"148","—Because with the scathold left him he has no old arable land, whilst the large farmer has.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",148
"149","20339. Then where .does the large farmer get this arable land?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",149
"150","—It is included in the scathold; it is attached to the scathold.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",150
"151","20340. That would show that the large farmer got the best of the scothold, because he got this town land with it?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",151
"152","—The town land was not scathold.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",152
"153","20341. What was it then?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",153
"154","—That is where the emigration took place from when the tenants left.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",154
"155","20342. But he got the vacant crofts?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",155
"156","—Yes, and he keeps the cross sheep on these places.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",156
"157","20343. Speaking generally, do you consider that the crofters might work their common land in conjunction with their crofts in a more profitable manner that they do now?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",157
"158","—I think they could. I think they could get much more out of it if they were to put blackfaced sheep on it, and employ one man to herd them all. The native sheep are so very wild, that really I do not think there is much profit in them.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",158
"159","20344. Although the wool of the native sheep appears of a higher class than that of the blackfaced sheep, don't you consider that the difference would be more than made up for by the price they would get for the mutton?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",159
"160","—No, I do not; because the few Shetland sheep I have will only average about 1½ pounds of wool, whilst the blackfaced would be more.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",160
"161","20345. What I meant was, even supposing the Shetland wool to be more valuable than the blackfaced, would it not be more profitable for a crofter to keep blackfaced sheep in respect of the price which he would get for the carcase?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",161
"162","—I think so.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",162
"163","20346. And besides that advantage he would also reap a benefit in the greater weight of the wool which he would get from a blackfaced sheep ?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",163
"164","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",164
"165","20347. Do you consider there is anything in the climate or soil to prevent him growing average blackfaced stock?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",165
"166","—No; I think the blackfaced stock improve here on similar land.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",166
"167","20348. Have any of the crofters, so far as you know, through Shetland, adopted this mode of pasturing their land with blackfaced sheep?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",167
"168","—I don't think so, so far as I know. Some of them have crossed them with the Shetland, but they do not make a good cross.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",168
"169","20349. You say that iu 1875 many people went to New Zealand; have good accounts been heard of those who went?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",169
"170","—A number of them have done well.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",170
"171","20350. Have they written home any good accounts to their friends?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",171
"172","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",172
"173","20351. Has that encouraged more people to go?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",173
"174","—No.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",174
"175","20352. The population here does not require thinning?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",175
"176","—No; because it is not the land they depend upon, but the sea. We don't want the population to decrease, and never did.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",176
"177","20353. Is there any disinclination on the part of the people to take leases when they are offered to them?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",177
"178","—Yes; they will only take them on one condition, so far as I can speak to, and that is that they shall be at liberty to leave when they like.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",178
"179","20351. That there is to be a break in favour of the tenant, and not in favour of the landlord?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",179
"180","—Exactly.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",180
"181","20355. Why do they object to leases in the ordinary way?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",181
"182","—They just say that something may occur, and that they would like to leave, and would not like to be bound for five or seven or ten or nineteen years. That is the invariable reply.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",182
"183","20356. Besides the ordinary fishing which the people occupy themselves with, do any of them go to the whale fishing?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",183
"184","—Not many from Unst.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",184
"185","20357. Did they use to go?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",185
"186","—Yes; perhaps forty or fifty years ago.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",186
"187","20358. Not subsequent to that period ?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",187
"188","—Not in my memory; very few.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",188
"189","20359. Do any of the whaling vessels come to Lerwick to pick up crews?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",189
"190","—Yes, from Peterhead and Dundee.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",190
"191","20360. Have you any idea how many whaling seamen go from Lerwick?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",191
"192","—No, I could not say; perhaps ten or fifteen ships call to pick up crews",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",192
"193","20361. Do they engage them through a broker, or do the people engage themselves?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",193
"194","—They engage through an agent in Lerwick.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",194
"195","20362. And do they settle with this agent for wages on their return?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",195
"196","—I believe so. They got so much in advance, and then they are paid a stated wage by the month, and so much oil money.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",196
"197","20363. That is all done through the broker?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",197
"198","—It is all done through the broker and captain.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",198
"199","20361. Where are the ships paid off—at Peterhead or Dundee?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",199
"200","—They generally call and leave the Shetland portion of the crew where they can.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",200
"201","20365. Do they settle immediately for what is due?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",201
"202","—They go to Lerwick and settle with the broker.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",202
"203","20366. Immediately?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",203
"204","—I don't know whether or not it lies for a little time.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",204
"205","20367. Does the broker supply them with clothes or other articles in advance?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",205
"206","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",206
"207","20368. Have you ever heard any dissatisfaction expressed with the method of engaging these whaling fishermen?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",207
"208","—No, I have not.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",208
"209","20369. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",209
"210","—You have had charge of this property since 1867?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",210
"211","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",211
"212","20370. You seem only to have been twenty years old then ?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",212
"213","—No, I was thirty; but I have had the management of the property since 1860. ",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",213
"214","20371. What relationship is there between yourself and the proprietor?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",214
"215","—First cousin. ",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",215
"216","20372. Explain what you mean by stating you are the lessee of the estate?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",216
"217","—I have a long lease of the whole estate from Mrs Edmonston. I pay her a free money rent annually for it, and take my chance of the rates; I do all the building of the houses, and meet all the expenses on the property, and give her a free money rent annually.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",217
"218","20373. Does the return in the valuation roll show all that is received from the tenants?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",218
"219","—I return all the rents I receive to the valuation roll.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",219
"220","20374. What advantage do you make then by holding the lease?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",220
"221","—I have a proportion of the rental; I have something off it.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",221
"222","20375. You derive no rental from the occupation of the crofters?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",222
"223","—An average was taken, and I pay so much a year and make the best of it; and I hold two farms in my own hand.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",223
"224","20376. Do the returns of the valuation roll show the full rent the crofters pay to you?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",224
"225","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",225
"226","20377. You mentioned the number of holdings in 1867 upon the estate?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",226
"227","—118; and 106 now.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",227
"228","20378. Can you inform us how many people were shifted in 1866 in order to constitute the two new tacks?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",228
"229","—I could not say really.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",229
"230","20379. Would there be as many as sixty families?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",230
"231","—No, not the fourth of that.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",231
"232","20380. At any time since 1867 there has not been that number?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",232
"233","—Not that number; but I could not say how many, unless I were referring to the books.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",233
"234","20381. What was your object in making that change; was it to benefit the condition of the people then on the estate, or with the object of introducing the sheep farms?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",234
"235","—No; I was factor on the estate, and the fact was that Mr Edmonston was not getting a couple of hundred a year out of the estate, and something had to be done in order to give him something to live upon.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",235
"236","20382. And the rental is now £900 ?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",236
"237","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",237
"238","20383. You have mentioned the price of Shetland wool as Is. 8d. to 2s. for black; what is the price of the blackfaced wool?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",238
"239","—What I have sold was sold at 7d. per lb.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",239
"240","20384. And how is it you say the blackfaced would be more profitable than the native?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",240
"241","—Because there is no comparison between the carcases of the two—of the blackfaced and Shetland sheep. The blackfaced is worth, perhaps, four times the amount of the Shetland, or five times as much.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",241
"242","20385. Can you give us any idea of the number of acres of land once under cultivation, but which is now out of cultivation, in the farms occupied by yourself and the other tenant?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",242
"243","—No, I can scarcely tell; I do not know that I could give anything like an idea. Do you mean what was held by crofters and cultivated?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",243
"244","20386. Yes?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",244
"245","—A considerable lot; but I could not tell; several hundred acres, I should say.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",245
"246","20387. That is lost, then, to the island for producing grain ?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",246
"247","—I do not know that it is lost; I am producing grain on one of the large farms where it was not producing grain before.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",247
"248","20388. How many acres have you under cultivation?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",248
"249","—About sixty; but it is under rotation of crop of course.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",249
"250","20389. But on the other farm the tenant was non-resident, and had no cultivation?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",250
"251","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",251
"252","20390. With regard to these small crofters, don't you think it was expected that they should make their living out of it, or that they must make their living elsewhere?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",252
"253","—I said so. I do not think a man with a large family could expect, with a £3 or a £5 croft, that he should be able to live on. ",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",253
"254","20391. Did it never occur to you that it would be better to increase the crofts of these people to such an extent that they might live on their produce?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",254
"255","—Yes; they had full liberty to get as much land as ever they wanted. The reason why we laid out sheep farms was that a number of the men had been lost by boat accidents, and a number had died, and there were no young men coming up wanting crofts. We had crofts vacant over the whole estate and we had to concentrate; the proprietor was getting very little rent, and we had to concentrate, and we removed tenants—perhaps two or three from one town—and put them into vacant places in another town, and then utilised these vacant towns by enclosing them for sheep.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",255
"256","20392. In the case of these removals, did you increase the holding?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",256
"257","—If they wished it we did.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",257
"258","20393. How do you mean—did you give then a larger area?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",258
"259","—Some of them took two crofts.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",259
"260","20394. And are in possession of them now?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",260
"261","—Yes; and some may have taken one and a half and so forth, if they wished.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",261
"262","20395. Are you satisfied that these operations which were carried through have been for the material benefit of the people?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",262
"263","—I don't think it has done them any harm.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",263
"264","20396. You don't think they have any ground of complaint?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",264
"265","—I don't think so.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",265
"266","20397. Are you aware that they did complain?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",266
"267","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",267
"268","20398. Would you give us a little information about the small property called Hammer; is there not such a place?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",268
"269","—Yes; on the north side of the Sound.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",269
"270","20399. It seems to be going to wreck, and the farm house to lie in ruins?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",270
"271","—The proprietrix, Mrs Spence, was a widow lady who emigrated with her two daughters to New Zealand, and left it in the hands of her nephew in Edinburgh, who is a lawyer.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",271
"272","20400. I want the reason generally of this state of things?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",272
"273","—Asking too much rent.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",273
"274","20401. Were the tenants removed against their will?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",274
"275","—No, none; it was a home farm, and not occupied by tenants at all.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",275
"276","20402. Not towards Haroldswick?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",276
"277","—No tenants have been removed between this and Haroldswick.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",277
"278","20403. There are considerable ruins of houses?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",278
"279","—People have died or left; none have been dispossessed.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",279
"280","20404. You made use of an expression which I should like you to reconsider; you said that Shetland hosiery was a drug in the market ?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",280
"281","—Just now.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",281
"282","20405. You don't mean that to apply to pure Shetland wool? ",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",282
"283","—I mean it to apply to fine articles, such as shawls and veils.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",283
"284","20406. Which are entirely of Shetland wool?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",284
"285","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",285
"286","20407. Not mixed?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",286
"287","—I understand so; I mean in market buying and selling. I hear people coming, for instance, to Mrs Edmonston with things and asking very low prices; they will take anything almost, because they cannot get them sold; and I am told by merchants that they have large stocks and cannot dispose of them in the southern markets.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",287
"288","20408. Have you heard any complaint by those who knit them that they have great difficulty in getting wool?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",288
"289","—I cannot say that I have.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",289
"290","20409. Have the prices of pure Shetland wool products fallen or net of late?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",290
"291","—I believe they have fallen.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",291
"292","20410. In consequence of overproduction?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",292
"293","—I do not know what it is the consequence of. I rather think it is from the fact of machine goods being made. I see fine Shetland shawls selling for Is. 6d. and 5s.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",293
"294","20411. But you know these are machine made?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",294
"295","—Yes, I do. ",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",295
"296","20412. In fact, the Shetland people have to complain of these machines? '",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",296
"297","— Certainly; I think they have no right to mark these things Shetland; they never saw Shetland at all. ",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",297
"298","20413. Are there any arrears of rent upon your estate, or do the tenants pay pretty well?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",298
"299","—They pay pretty well, but there are always some arrears.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",299
"300","20414. Are most of them engaged in fishing as well?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",300
"301","—-A number are.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",301
"302","20115. Do you find those engaged in fishing pay you better than those who are not?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",302
"303","—I don't think they do, but they have paid with fairly good regularity for a number of years back.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",303
"304","20416. Is there any land in Unst occasionally for sale in small portions, whereby the people who have a little money may become proprietors?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",304
"305","—There is; there is some for sale just now—small pieces.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",305
"306","20417. Do they sell high or low?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",306
"307","—Last year there were one or two small pieces sold here very high. Perhaps that was owing to the situation; but I have seen small properties in the market for a long time without a purchaser.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",307
"308","20418. What would be a fair purchase taking it by so many years—what do you consider a common thing?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",308
"309","—Twenty years used to be considered a fair rate.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",309
"310","20419. No more than that?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",310
"311","—No.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",311
"312","20420. Are you speaking of net or gross rental?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",312
"313","—Gross rental; there is a very great difference between net and gross rental in Shetland.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",313
"314","20421. So that, when you say twenty years, you speak of gross rental?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",314
"315","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",315
"316","20422. Is this locality of Balta Sound coming into considerable importance?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",316
"317","—It is, owing to the fishing.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",317
"318","20423. Is there any intention, upon the part of the proprietor or yourself, of erecting any harbour or quay accommodation?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",318
"319","—I don't think so; not at present.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",319
"320","20424. Would it not pay you to do so?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",320
"321","—I think it would, if we had the money, but we have not the money to do it. I would do it at once if we could get money cheap, and it would be a very great accommodation to the fishermen and fish-curers.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",321
"322","20425. Supposing anything were done in the way of accommodation—that Government should do something by making a quay for vessels coming in here—would there be sufficient revenue to pay a fair interest upon it?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",322
"323","—I think there would, if the fishing held good; and I think there is every prospect of the fishing increasing instead of the contrary.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",323
"324","20426. Within your own knowledge, during the last few years, it has increased considerably?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",324
"325","—Very considerably.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",325
"326","20427. Is the number of boats we now see up to the average or beyond what was here last year?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",326
"327","—They are far beyond. There were only eleven here last year, and there are something like 180 just now.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",327
"328","20428. Sheriff Nicolson.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",328
"329","—I think you stated that, at the time of Mr Edmonston's death, he drew only £200. Does that mean that the rental was only £200?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",329
"330","—Clear rental; he had only that to spend for some years.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",330
"331","20429. What was the rental in the valuation roll at that time?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",331
"332","—Between £500 and £600.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",332
"333","20430. So that it has been nearly doubled since then?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",333
"334","—Not nearly.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",334
"335","20431. Is it not £962 now?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",335
"336","—But that is including the fishing stations. There was a lot let off for fishing stations last year.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",336
"337","20432. At what rate is the charge for fishing stations?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",337
"338","—£10 to £12.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",338
"339","20433. Upon whom is the charge levied for these stations—-how is the money raised?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",339
"340","—From the curer; I let them so much ground for a station.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",340
"341","20434. Whether is the bulk of the rent paid by the sheep farms or the smallers farmers or crofters?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",341
"342","—The bulk is paid by the crofters, I should think.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",342
"343","0435. Has there been any considerable increase of their rents since 1867?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",343
"344","—No increase since that time.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",344
"345","20436. So that the whole increase of rent was at that time?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",345
"346","—It was put on at that time.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",346
"347","20437. What is the rental of these two sheep farms?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",347
"348","—I have not the valuation roll, and can hardly say. There are four large farms on the estate.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",348
"349","20438. What proportion of the total rental on the estate was paid by the crofters?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",349
"350","—I cannot very well tell from memory; the valuation roll, of course, shows.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",350
"351","20439. Sheep farming on a large scale is quite recent in this island?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",351
"352","—Since about 1867 or 1868.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",352
"353","20440. Were there no large sheep farms in Shetland before that?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",353
"354","—Yes, a few, but none in this island.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",354
"355","20441. You removed a good many people from the south side of Balta Sound?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",355
"356","—Not many.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",356
"357","20442. How many, do you remember?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",357
"358","—I don't remember; we removed some.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",358
"359","20443. Against their will?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",359
"360","—No, they went quite readily. There was a boat accident happened there, and a lot of men were lost, and people gave up their crofts; and then some others emigrated, and two or three gave them up and wanted to take a small place, and the place became almost vacant, and we removed the remainder.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",360
"361","20444. You have not removed any against their will?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",361
"362","—No.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",362
"363","20445. Or put them into a worse place than that they were in before?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",363
"364","—I don't think so. In fact we paid some of them for removing, and gave them lower rents in consequence.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",364
"365","20446. Perhaps your idea of a better place might be different from theirs?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",365
"366","—Of course it might.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",366
"367","20447. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",367
"368","—There is not one upon Balta Island now?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",368
"369","—No, and has not been for a couple of centuries.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",369
"370","20448. Is that part of your tack?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",370
"371","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",371
"372","20449. The Chairman.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",372
"373","—You stated that you were lessee of the whole estate?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",373
"374","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",374
"375","20450. So that you stand, in reference to the tenantry, very much in the position of a proprietor?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",375
"376","—I do.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",376
"377","20451. The whole administration of the estate is left to you without any restriction?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",377
"378","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",378
"379","20452. It is open to you to raise rents or diminish them, or shift tenants in holdings, or do anything you like?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",379
"380","—So far as that is concerned, I am in place of the proprietor.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",380
"381","20453. There is no restriction put upon your action?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",381
"382","—None in the least.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",382
"383","20454. Are you permanently interested in the welfare of the estate?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",383
"384","—I am the next heir after Mrs Edmonston.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",384
"385","20455. Professor Mackinnon.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",385
"386","—You said the fourth of Unst was in the hands of small proprietors?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",386
"387","—I think so.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",387
"388","20456. Do you know if there are any of them here to-day?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",388
"389","—Yes, I see one; not one I would apply the statement I made about the payment of poor rates to; but I see a gentleman here who has lately purchased land.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",389
"390","20457. Is he a native of the island?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",390
"391","—No, but he has been a long time in the island.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",391
"392","20458. Is he a native of Shetland?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",392
"393","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",393
"394","20459. What is his name?-",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",394
"395","—Mr Sandison, of Uyea Sound. ",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",395
"396","20460. The Chairman.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",396
"397","—Have you any other statement you wish to make?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",397
"398","—In regard to the statement of Robert Robertson, I would say he was turned off the mainland—I think he said he was put off for sheep. He was a moving blade. He moved several times of his own accord, and seemed never at rest. He was not put off; he asked to be moved, and took another croft, and he got what he thought a better bargain and went to it.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",398
"399","20461. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",399
"400","—He had only been five years there?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",400
"401","—I forget how long.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",401
"402","20462. The Chairman.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",402
"403","—What more? Another statement was that he was keeping a daughter and the family of a son-in-law, whereas the daughter and whole family have been kept by the parochial board, and I am not sure that they are not getting something yet.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",403
"404","—I wanted to state that, because it seemed rather hard that he was keeping a family of orphans, when he was not.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",404
"405","20463. Professor Mackinnon.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",405
"406","—He said he had to take charge of them and provide for them, but they are now doing work; at least, it implied that?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",406
"407","—It seemed to me that he was supposed to be keeping them. The only thing else I might say is with regard to the merk of land, as they are speaking so much about it. A merk is not measurement at all. It is a shene, an old Norse portion or share. In some towns a merk may not be an acre; in others it may be an acre, and in others it may be three. It is a most indefinite thing a merk.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",407
"408","20464. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",408
"409","—It was a value of land?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",409
"410","—Yes, a share.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",410
"411","20465. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",411
"412","—It is a portion of a town?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",412
"413","—Yes. There may be two townships of 100 merks each, and the one may measure 300 acres and the other not 100.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",413
"414","20466. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",414
"415","—It is the value at the time?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",415
"416","—Yes. And thus when scatholds are divided, they are divided according to the merks of land. One may hold twenty, another forty, and another ten, and so forth, and it is all divided into merks; a town having say 100, the whole is divided into l00ths, and each man gets so many hundredths per merk.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",416
"417","20467. Does the property descend here to the eldest son?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",417
"418","—Yes.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",418
"419","20468. Professor Mackinnon.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",419
"420","—A merk has a value with reference to the scathold ?",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",420
"421","—Yes, and stipend; a great many things are paid by the merk; and some of the crown taxes are paid by merks also.",358,"David Charles Edmonston","Unst, Baltasound",421
