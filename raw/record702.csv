"1","WILLIAM MACDOUGALL, Merchant, Grantown (40)—examined.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",1
"2","43039. Mr Cameron.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",2
"3","—How long have you been established at Grantown?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",3
"4","—I have been there for twenty-five years.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",4
"5","43040. What does your business chiefly consist in ?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",5
"6","—In drapery principally, and in grocery and ironmongery, and the different things that are kept in large stores.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",6
"7","43041. You are well acquainted with the inhabitants of Grantown and the neighbourhood, I presume?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",7
"8","—Yes.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",8
"9","43042. You have dealings, I suppose, with all classes of persons —with proprietors, with shooting tenants, with farmers, and with small farmers and crofters?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",9
"10","—Yes. I did not come here as a delegate, but by invitation of the Commissioners.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",10
"11","43043. I am aware of that. The Commission asked you, as they thought you would be able to give some evidence about the condition of the people and the business in which you are engaged. Now, with which of these classes do you deal to the greatest extent?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",11
"12","—With the farmers of the strath.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",12
"13","43044. Are there many of what we call small crofters in the neighbourhood of Grantown?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",13
"14","—There are a good many small farms, but I could not say about the size of them. There are a number of farms from thirty to eighty acres in the country round about",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",14
"15","43045. Do you have many dealings with those small farmers?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",15
"16","—Yes.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",16
"17","43046. What has been the result of your observation for the last fifteen years with respect to the condition of those small farmers?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",17
"18","—I should say they are better now than they were fifteen years ago; and they were getting on very well till about seven years ago, but since then they have had very bad years, and it has been up-hill work.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",18
"19","43047. Has your business shown a falling off in consequence?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",19
"20","—We do a large business outside the strath, but I should say it has not improved in Strathspey in that time.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",20
"21","43048. I am confining my observations to the small farmer; what has been the cause of the diminution in the volume of business?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",21
"22","—I do not suppose there is any. It is very much the same as it was seven years ago.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",22
"23","43049. I thought you said their condition was not so good?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",23
"24","—No, they have had bad years, but if good times were coming again I should say our trade will increase with them.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",24
"25","43050. But so far as your trade is concerned, have you noticed any falling off in the trade between you and the small farmers in the last seven years?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",25
"26","—Well, the trade is very much the same, but they do not pay so well as they did.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",26
"27","43051. You have more bad debts?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",27
"28","—More bad debts.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",28
"29","43052. But you believe that is caused chiefly by bad seasons?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",29
"30","—Yes.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",30
"31","43053. And you believe a recurrence of good seasons will mitigate that evil, if not altogether remove it?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",31
"32","—Yes.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",32
"33","43054. I want to ask you some questions regarding your dealings with shooting tenants; do you have much to do with them?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",33
"34","—Yes.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",34
"35","43055. I suppose you find they are a pretty good class of customers. You have not many bad debts so far as they are concerned?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",35
"36","—No.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",36
"37","43056. What class of goods do you supply to those shooting tenants?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",37
"38","—Tweeds principally, but we do a good deal in grocery goods also.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",38
"39","43057. But we were told at Inverness that the shooting tenants of late years had been in the habit of obtaining their groceries more from stores in London and elsewhere than in the district?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",39
"40","—A great many of them do, but they all buy largely in Grantown.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",40
"41","43058. Have you found the disposition to take groceries from stores increase of late years or not, or has it been much the same?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",41
"42","—I cannot say—I think very much the same.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",42
"43","43059. But has the volume of your business with shooting tenants increased of late years, and is it increasing?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",43
"44","—I should say it was increasing.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",44
"45","43060. A gentleman made a statement, which I could not quite understand, that not only were the shooting tenants in the habit of employing stores more than formerly for groceries, but they also got cloth from the south instead of from Inverness; is that your experience?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",45
"46","—They purchase furnishings and carpets from those stores.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",46
"47","43061. But I am talking of cloth?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",47
"48","—I am not aware.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",48
"49","43062. You mentioned cloth as one of the principal commodities with which you supplied them?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",49
"50","—Yes; l am not aware of their getting tweeds or cloths of any kind from the stores.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",50
"51","43063. Now, what is your opinion generally as to the effect of these shooting tenants upon the bulk of the population —the native inhabitants—do you think it is a beneficial effect, or the reverse?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",51
"52","—I should say a beneficial effect. During the two or three months in autumn they leave a great deal of money in the country.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",52
"53","43064. Have you ever noticed that the employment of the people, of the servants connected with the shooting lodges—gillies, and so on —has any demoralising effect upon their characters?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",53
"54","—I have often heard it said it has, but I am not aware it is so, and I cannot mention an instance.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",54
"55","43065. Have you heard it said by any person upon whose judgment you would be apt to rely, such as a minister, for instance?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",55
"56","—No.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",56
"57","43066. You do not recollect any instance of a minister telling you he noticed anything demoralising in the effect of contact with the shooting tenants by the people?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",57
"58","—No.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",58
"59","43067. I suppose they do employ a good many people of one sort or another?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",59
"60","—They do. In one lodge there are seven or eight gamekeepers employed.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",60
"61","43068. And how many gillies?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",61
"62","—I cannot say.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",62
"63","43069. Have you ever heard any general complaint made as to the conduct of any of these shooting tenants— any exercise of hardship or unfortunate misunderstandings between them or their keepers and the farmers or natives?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",63
"64","—I cannot recollect of any just now.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",64
"65","43070. Of course, you have often heard of damages done by game?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",65
"66","—Yes, but I am not in a position to mention them.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",66
"67","43071. But your impression, having mixed largely with the small farming class, is that they are well satisfied with the state of things that exists and the relations which subsist between them and the shooting tenants?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",67
"68","—I should say so.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",68
"69","43072. And they would not like to see them disappear?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",69
"70","—They would not. There is no feeling against them. For instance, in regard to the grouse shootings, there is no unkindly feeling that I ever heard.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",70
"71","43073. And with regard to the deer forests, is there any feeling about them?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",71
"72","—There might be more in the case of deer forests.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",72
"73","43074. But is there; have you heard of any?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",73
"74","—I am not prepared to mention any particular case.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",74
"75","43075. When I talk of shooting tenants, I include deer forests as well as grouse shootings, and your dealings are with both?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",75
"76","—Yes.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",76
"77","43076. And the deer forest tenants as a rule are the wealthier of the two?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",77
"78","—Yes.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",78
"79","43077. Though not so numerous?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",79
"80","—No. In Strathspey we have only two, I think.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",80
"81","43078. What is done with the venison which these deer forest tenants kill?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",81
"82","—Well, I think it is sent away in presents by the sportsmen to their friends.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",82
"83","43079. Do they give much of it away to the farmers in the neighbourhood, and innkeepers?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",83
"84","—Not in the neighbourhood where I am. They give it to the poorer crofters.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",84
"85","43080. They use it all somehow or other?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",85
"86","—They use it all.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",86
"87","43081. Do they kill hinds in the winter?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",87
"88","—I am not sure.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",88
"89","43082. Do you never see any hind venison about?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",89
"90","—No, I have never been in the forests, and am not posted up about the way they do.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",90
"91","43083. Have you any cattle shows in Grantown?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",91
"92","—Yes.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",92
"93","43084. Any other festive gathering of any sort?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",93
"94","—I think there is only the cattle show.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",94
"95","43085. Have you not games?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",95
"96","—Yes; they used to be held at Castle Grant at one time, and were very successful, but they have not been so successful latterly. ",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",96
"97","43086. Are there any games held at Abernethy now?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",97
"98","—-Yes, and the people turn out very largely.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",98
"99","43087. Do the shooting tenants at all subscribe to the festivities of the district and assist in the amusement of the people?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",99
"100","—Yes, but there is not very much money required. I know they all give cheerfully, and at our cattle show they give prizes very handsomely.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",100
"101","43088. Do they subscribe to the local charities at all? Perhaps there are none?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",101
"102","—Well, I am not very sure about that.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",102
"103","43089. Have you had anything to do with contracts for wire fencing?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",103
"104","—Yes.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",104
"105","43090. There is a great deal of wire fencing employed in connection with these deer forests, is there not?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",105
"106","—Yes, a great deal.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",106
"107","43091. You have had something to do with these contracts?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",107
"108","—Yes, we have had a good deal to do with several forests for ten or fifteen years.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",108
"109","43092. Can you tell me the number of miles of wire fencing erected in connection with these deer forests within the last ten years?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",109
"110","—No.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",110
"111","43093. But you have had something to do with these contracts?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",111
"112","—Yes.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",112
"113","43094. Are a good number of people employed in connection with these wire fences?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",113
"114","—Yes, a large number.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",114
"115","43095. Is that still going on?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",115
"116","—Yes.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",116
"117","43096. Do they make many roads and paths up to the tops of the hills, or partly to the tops?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",117
"118","—Well, occasionally; but there is not very much work in that way, I daresay.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",118
"119","43097. Perhaps the ground is sound, and they do not want paths?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",119
"120","—Yes, in many places they do not require paths.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",120
"121","43098. Sheriff Nicolson.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",121
"122","—-I have heard that people used to gather cranberries a good deal in Strathspey?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",122
"123","—Yes.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",123
"124","43099. And that they are prevented in some places by the shooting tenant?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",124
"125","—I have not heard of a shooting tenant ever keeping them back from gathering them, but I have heard that this year some of the keepers kept them back. I do not know whether it was with the consent of the tenants or not.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",125
"126","43100. Was that prejudicial to the industry of the people?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",126
"127","—It would have been this year, but for four years back there was no crop.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",127
"128","43101. I suppose gamekeepers can do a good many things disagreeable to people which are not ordered by their masters?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",128
"129","—It is in the interest of the masters. They wish to behave as kindly to the natives as is possible.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",129
"130","The people, however, gathered a great many. I am sure that several cartloads have been gathered in the different parts of Strathspey this year.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",130
"131","43102. But do you know any instance in which they have been actually prohibited?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",131
"132","—No, but I know the gamekeepers do not wish to allow them inside certain parts of the forest.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",132
"133","43103. Then it would be a loss to some poor people?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",133
"134","—Yes, but they would not make very much money out of them.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",134
"135","43104. Where do these cranberries grow?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",135
"136","—Just on the hill sides, always where there is heather, and it is only one year in three or four that there is a crop.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",136
"137","43105. At what time of the year are they gathered?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",137
"138","—From the middle of August to the middle of September.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",138
"139","43106. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",139
"140","—Are there any complaints in your district on the part of the crofters, do you hear, in the district of Strathspey?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",140
"141","—No. They have not had good years the last six or seven years, but they are certainly a contented class of people, and have been all their time looking forward to bad years.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",141
"142","43107. Have you heard any complaints about some of their hill grazings being taken away partly for planting and partly enclosing in forest?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",142
"143","—There have been instances, but I am not prepared to speak of them, because I am not a farmer, and from a business point of view I cannot speak.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",143
"144","43108. I wish to know whether people complain to you when they come to your shop?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",144
"145","—No, they would not make a complaint to me in a case of that sort.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",145
"146","43109. Supposing you were dunning them for a past due account, would they not give the reasons why they did not pay?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",146
"147","—They just speak of the bad years, and hope times will improve.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",147
"148","43110. Has there not been a forest within the last few years created in the parish of Abernethy ?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",148
"149","—Yes, a good many years ago.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",149
"150","43111. How many years ago?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",150
"151","—About twelve or fifteen years ago.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",151
"152","43112. How was that occupied before?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",152
"153","—-I cannot answer that. I was not the least interested in farming, and cannot answer.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",153
"154","43113. You are not able to give an opinion?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",154
"155","—No; I thought you would only ask questions of me in a business way.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",155
"156","43114. Are you acquainted with Badenoch and Strathnairn?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",156
"157","—Yes, I am a native of that district.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",157
"158","43115. What are the people there saying?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",158
"159","—I have not been there twice in seven years.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",159
"160","43116. Are they better off than in Strathspey; do they pay more readily?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",160
"161","—We have no accounts in Strathnairn.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",161
"162","43117. Which is the more flourishing district—Badenoch or Strathspey?",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",162
"163","—I cannot give any comparison upon that.",702,"William Macdougall","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",163
