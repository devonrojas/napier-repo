"1","JOHN LAWSON, Salmon Fisher, Portree (58)—examined.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",1
"2","9640. The Chairman.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",2
"3","—Will you endeavour shortly to make a statement of your own opinions with reference to the salmon fishery connected with the Isle of Skye?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",3
"4","—I am very sorry to say that I am not prepared to do anything of the kind, for I did not know that I was to be called forward. If you ask me any questions that I can answer I will be very glad to do so.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",4
"5","9641. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",5
"6","—We have been told that Mr Johnston has for the last two or three years conducted these fishings at a loss, but he says he thinks they may be improved by some form of legislation?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",6
"7","—That is, by extending them round the island. What we have on lease we cannot improve much more, but what he means to say, as I understand—I never knew anything about that till I heard Mr Darroch read it—is that if he was lessee of more of the Skye shores, he would extend the fishing still",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",7
"8","further, and that would give more employment.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",8
"9","9642. Is he not able to take more fishings?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",9
"10","—He would take them if he could get them, but proprietors are not willing to go into the affair,",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",10
"11","9643. The shores are not all fished?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",11
"12","—No,",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",12
"13","9644. And Mr Johnston wishes to fish them?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",13
"14","—Yes, because I know he has tried. ",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",14
"15","9645. Professor Mackinnon.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",15
"16","—To what extent does your lease extend?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",16
"17","—We have Major Fraser's shore, Lord Macdonald's shore, and part of John Lawson, Macleod of Macleod's.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",17
"18","9646. Have you Mr Macallister's?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",18
"19","—No.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",19
"20","9647. Nor round the other shore between?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",20
"21","—No.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",21
"22","9648. And you would want to have the whole complete round of the island?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",22
"23","—We might slip parts of the island.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",23
"24","9649. Has any one else got the other shores?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",24
"25","—No, there is no fishing on the island but ours.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",25
"26","9650. How many people are employed?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",26
"27","—We employ one hundred and ten fishermen.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",27
"28","9651. Are they mostly natives of this place?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",28
"29","—They are all natives, except myself and my son.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",29
"30","9652. Supposing you got the whole fishings of Skye, how many would you employ?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",30
"31","—I cannot say exactly in the meantime. It would depend upon our success in opening up those fishings.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",31
"32","9653. Roughly, how many would you say?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",32
"33","—We employ one hundred and ten, and we might perhaps add another fifty or perhaps another",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",33
"34","hundred.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",34
"35","9654. By getting the rest of the shores you could improve the fishing of the whole place?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",35
"36","—It would only improve the shore that is lying waste.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",36
"37","9655. You would not increase the number of fish by your mode of fishing in any way?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",37
"38","—We would have to bring more to the ice-house, as we would be putting out more expense.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",38
"39","9656. It is just to stretch the length of your shore?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",39
"40","—That is all. We do not consider that we would diminish the fish on the ground we are",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",40
"41","fishing.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",41
"42","9657. Don't you think the limited ground you have is better, because there is no other person fishing?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",42
"43","—No, I don't believe that.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",43
"44","9658. So there would be no diminution of your profit even supposing another lessee took it up?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",44
"45","—No, supposing there were other one hundred and ten men fishing as strong as we do.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",45
"46","9659. You think the salmon could supply you all?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",46
"47","—Oh, the sea is wide between here and America.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",47
"48","9660. So it is just in proportion to the extent of the shore that you would develop the fishing?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",48
"49","—Yes ; besides the men I have mentioned, we have four carts driving to us and a small steamer.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",49
"50","9661. There would be more fish and more men?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",50
"51","—Yes, and more material put out.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",51
"52","9662. More fish caught over the island?",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",52
"53","—Yes.",169,"John Lawson","Skye, Portree",53
