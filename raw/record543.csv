"2","32330. The Chairman.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",2
"3","—Have you a statement to make?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",3
"4","—Yes. 'My name is Donald Stewart, blacksmith and crofter, Little Galder. About sixty-five years ago all this glen was inhabited, there being twelve or thirteen townships. All these were deprived of their holdings. The most of them emigrated to America. The rest of them were put close together near the sea-shore, namely Galder. There were about twenty crofters in Galder, having an acre or two acres each of arable land, with hill pasture for one or two cows and their followers, but no sheep. At the time of the famine thirty-four years ago, these crofters petitioned the proprietor for assistance, who gave them their choice of a free passage to America, or to have their crofts free of rent till the famine ended; but the then factor concealed from them the fact that they might have the land free for a time, and thus they had no choice but to emigrate. Those that remained were in possession of Galder. About two years after the emigration, Mr Mitchell, the large sheep farmer, who was very intimate with the factor, and wishing to enlarge his farm, asked the whole of Galder, which the factor at once granted him, much against the will of the people, and of my father who had a large share in it, and who reasoned with the factor about the loss the people suffered by taking the land from them, and their rent paid. The factor gave no hearing to this, but gave it to Mitchell; and we believe all this was done quite unknown to the proprietor. Since then, a person cannot get pasture for any beast in Glenelg, unless he can get it in Skye. But still my father was left in possession of Little Galder, for which he paid £14 of rent, until he died twenty-two years ago. Then I succeeded him, and paid the same rent. Sixteen years ago I reclaimed two and a half acres of land; since then I built a barn, byre, and stable, and built an addition to our dwelling house which my father built. I spent more money on the property than any other crofter in it. Five years ago the present factor Mr Mollison, in June 1878, took from me the largest half of my croft, and charged me £10, 10s. for the remaining half, saying Mr Mitchell, the farmer, who had already twenty miles stretch of land, by in some part adding townships together, was offering £12 for it. I wrote to Mr Mitchell and. reminded him of how his father took from us Big Galder, and that I thought it a hard matter if he was again coveting the small piece left me, by which I supported a large family and aged mother. He replied stating that he never asked any of my land. I showed Mr Mollison unwillingness to the alteration, at which he became haughty, saying he was commissioner of the estate, and if I would say a single word, he would take the whole from me, and drew out a form in writing and made me sign it to that effect, and promised me more land in a short time. Likely he was afraid the proprietor would hear of it, of whom we had never any reason to complain, for if the factors had acted according to his orders, the crofters here would have been as well off as any in Scotland, for it was a rule on the estate that the land was not to be taken from any man as long as he paid the rent. But as he was not coming to the place, the factors did as they liked. The half taken from me would keep four cows, from which I took a profit of between £15 and £20 a year. Next Whitsunday the factor mentioned that he would require to raise my rent again, for he said the half given to Mitchell was worth only £4, 10s. to him, but he did not follow his demand. I  calculated on Mr Mitchell's large farm, which should contain upwards of 5000 sheep, at £800 rent, the pasture of fifteen sheep which the half taken from me should keep, would come to £2, 8s. which it is worth to Mitchell, and now of less value, for it is already overgrown with rashes and coarse grass, where I had good crops of corn, potatoes, and ryegrass. Many of my neighbours who have no land would thankfully give £ 6 for it. Being thus deprived of the best half of my croft, I was unable to keep my family and mother in the same circumstances as formerly, and became under the necessity of breaking an agreement made with my mother at my father's death that I would support and give her a cow's grazing as long as I could. This change made a great injury on my mother. I am not afraid of the factor this year. If I was as little afraid of him five years ago, I would have my croft yet. We got a new proprietor, who is very kind to the people, and seeming to have a great interest in them, and who will not, we trust, allow the same as the foregoing usages. My circumstances was now so much reduced that I had to begin the herring fishing. This is only one instance of many others of a far worse kind done to my neighbours, and some of these carried on yet by Mr Mitchell. I have no pleasure in running down any person, but merely to show how we are treated as slaves, misrepresented and befooled continually, that suffering under these grievances. We want as much land as will keep us comfortable, which is our inheritance, at a fair rent; that the Government would buy good slices of these sheep runs, going into waste for want of cultivation and stock; that we pay the rent to  Government, so as to enable us to look upon ourselves as free men, for we are tired of this tyranny. Another of my neighbours, who has a large family, and aged father and mother dependent on him, has a cow's pasture on Mr Mitchell's sheep pasture, for which he charges £3, 10s. The man asked to be allowed to keep the calf, for which he offered 10s. more, to enable him to pay the pasture. This was refused ; the man complained, and said he was afraid ho would require to sell the cow, for the wintering with the pastnre was too heavy on him. Mr Mitchell replied that was what he liked. So there is no sympathy with the aged or infant; sheep and the love of money is the whole go, and so on with every other person.'",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",4
"5","32331.

"72","—I have not heard that said.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",72
"73","32365. Mr Cameron (to Donald M'Leod).",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",73
"74","—What statement have you to make?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",74
"75","—'Statement in behalf of the Township of Galder, Glenelg.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",75
"76","The inhabitants of the district of Galder, Glenelg, wish to say to the Royal Commissioners, that in their district there are seventeen families consisting of eighty souls, ten of whom are paupers. Seven families of these have not an inch of ground except what their houses stand on. Their houses were erected by themselves, and they pay a ground rent of five shillings a year for their stances. Six families have from one to four acres each. The fences surrounding their land have been put up by themselves, but as they cannot afford to lay out money on wire fences to the extent required, their crops are much injured by the sheep of the farmers whose land surrounds them. Two of the crofters kept dogs for a short time, to help to keep off the trespassing sheep; but the farmer sent them word that unless they sent away their dogs, he would get them turned out of their crofts. These have to say, however, that the farmer has given them wire this summer, with which they intend, as soon as it can be done, to improve their fences. The district of Galder, over thirty years ago, was wholly occupied by crofters, when they had the whole of the hill pasture, and so were able to keep a sufficient number of cattle to provide milk for their families. Now, only three of the seventeen families are able to feed their cow on their own croft. Three others have a cow each, for which they have to pay £ 3 to the  farmer for hill pasture. Owing to the unnecessary shutting up of an old road, which existed from time immemorial, these three cows have to be driven over two miles before they get to their pasture. If they come to the gate on this old road they are hunted by the farmer's dogs, to their great injury. This gate is not 200 yards from the crofters' houses, - and they consider it a great hardship, especially when it does not interfere with any crop, to have to drive their cattle such a round. One of the crofters said to the manager that he would lay this grievance before the Royal Commission. The reply was that neither he nor his master cared for the Royal Commission. These crofters trust that the Royal Commission will be the means of their getting their crofts added to, so that they may be enabled to support themselves and their families decently. There is a good deal of land in the parish at present available for their purpose, and they are willing to give a fair rent for any portion assigned to them. Another grievance which affects the whole parish is, that there is no money order office, and no telegraph office, nearer than Lochalsh. The post road to Lochalsh is merely a sheep track over the hill, and in wet weather it is absolutely dangerous, owing to the boggy nature of the ground. The want of proper postal and telegraph communication is most felt during the herring fishing season, when messages often cannot be sent in time to command a proper market for the herring, thereby entailing great loss on the poor people, many of whom go to Lochourn for the fishing.' ",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",76
"77","In addition to the foregoing, we have to state the following facts:",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",77
"78","—That we went peaceably to Mr Mitchell, and asked him to be kind enough to open the gate for our cows. He answered, the argument is not at an end, it will be the case that you will not get a cow's grass at all, and he swore not to anger him. This was for making an opening for the cows to come home at a very late hour. Having got no satisfaction from Mr Mitchell, we went to Mr Mollison the factor, to consult with him about our trouble. He replied it was tormentable to drive the cattle up the hill and that round ; "" but you must keep quiet, or else I ""will put the snatches on you."" Then we gave up getting any justice. Twenty-nine years ago we were put out of our houses, and every article we had put out on the main road, until we acknowledged to give up our land for another man, being three days and three nights outside until we consented to give up the land. Ever since that time we had no land until last Whitsunday, we got one acre each from the present factor. We believe all the hardships we suffered, was never known to the proprietor.'",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",78
"79","32366. Do you represent the people of Galder?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",79
"80","—Yes.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",80
"81","32367. Who wrote this paper?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",81
"82","—Mrs Macdonald, the minister's wife, wrote the first part.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",82
"83","32368. And who wrote the last part?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",83
"84","—One of the scholars.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",84
"85","32369. The same person did not compose both parts?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",85
"86","—Upon the first occasion I told Mrs Macdonald what to put down, and she put it down in her own language; and I dictated some to the boy, and the boy put it down in his own language too.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",86
"87","32370. Is it the boy's composition or your own?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",87
"88","—It is my own language.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",88
"89","32371. You dictated it to a boy, who wrote it down?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",89
"90","—Yes.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",90
"91","32372. You say that the farmer has given some of them wire this summer, with which they intend, as soon as it can be done, to improve their fences. Does that mean all, or only some?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",91
"92","—That is some of them who have more land than I and my neighbour have. We have only a small portion, and our cows graze upon Mr Mitchell's place; and I had to sell my own, because of the way it was being used by the shepherds, and I have only a quey now.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",92
"93","32373. Is the whole township enclosed with a wire fence, or is each croft separated from the other by a wire fence?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",93
"94","—There are only two crofts that are fenced round; the others have no fence to separate them from Mr Mitchell's farm.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",94
"95","32374. And these two are the crofters who have got the wire with which they intend to repair the fence?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",95
"96","—Yes; and they have got it in order to prevent the farmer's sheep trespassing upon their arable ground, with which they had been very much bothered.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",96
"97","32375. What common grazing have these crofters got?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",97
"98","—We have no common grazing at all. My neighbour and I have nothing except the grazing upon the farm, and the other two have only the grazing within the fence.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",98
"99","32376. Then the pasture to which these three cows have to be driven is the pasture belonging to the farm?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",99
"100","—Yes.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",100
"101","32377. Can Mr Mitchell not give them pasture a little nearer than two miles?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",101
"102","—The pasture is near enough, if he would only let us through that gate ; it would only be 200 yards from the houses, but he compels us to make a circuit of two miles to get to it.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",102
"103","32378. Did the manager give any reason, when he was asked to allow the crofters' cattle to go through the gate, why he would not do it?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",103
"104","—No, he would not.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",104
"105","32379. Have you any idea what the reason is?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",105
"106","—I cannot tell; no reason in the world, unless that he would have better pasture for his sheep.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",106
"107","32380. But, as I understand, the cows get the pasture once they are on the other side of the fence, only you have to drive them round to the fence. They would not eat any more grass although they went through the gate?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",107
"108","—We have to take them round a circuit of two miles, morning and afternoon. He has reserve pasture within the fence, and which he does not like us to go over, and so he compels us to make the circuit. The public road is on one side, and there is a gate, but there is a rock, and the cattle have to go round this ; the wire fence ends at the rock, and the cattle have to go round.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",108
"109","32381. But there is no pasture along the road that they could injure or destroy?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",109
"110","—No; the fence is quite close to the road.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",110
"111","32382. Mr Mitchell said the argument was not at an end,' what did you understand by that?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",111
"112","—We got a chance one night of the gate being open, and we brought the cattle through it, and that was the reason why he commenced to talk.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",112
"113","32383. You talk about the telegraph and post, and you say the post road to Lochalsh is merely a sheep track over the hill. Is the post sent by a foot messenger?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",113
"114","—By a foot messenger.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",114
"115","32384. How many days a week?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",115
"116","—Three days a week.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",116
"117","32385. Are you aware that a new parcel post opened yesterday or the day before? ",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",117
"118","—Oh yes, I know of it ; and the man is carrying parcels.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",118
"119","32386. Have you received any parcels at Galder since it was opened?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",119
"120","—No.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",120
"121","32387. Have you sent any away?",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",121
"122","—No. It would be very necessary to have improved communication during the fishing season to Loch Hourn.",543,"Donald Stewart, Donald Mcleod","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",122
