"2","30116*. Mr Cameron. ",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",2
"3","—Is your father alive ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",3
"4","—Yes. ",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",4
"5","30117.  And holding a croft and paying rent ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",5
"6","—Yes. ",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",6
"7","30117*. Does the summing of the crofters correspond with the head of stock kept by the tenants ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",7
"8","—Yes, undoubtedly ; our own statement.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",8
"9","30118. Is it according to the stock they are entitled to keep?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",9
"10","—Yes, undoubtedly.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",10
"11","30119. How many tenants are there?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",11
"12","—Five tenants in that small village.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",12
"13","30120. In Avernish?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",13
"14","—No, there are other three besides that, and the mill croft.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",14
"15","30121. How many tenants are there altogether?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",15
"16","—Nine.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",16
"17","30122. Your father's name is George Finlayson. What is the number of cattle he keeps ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",17
"18","—One cow, a follower, and a calf some years, and some years not.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",18
"19","30123. At the present moment?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",19
"20","—One cow and one calf.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",20
"21","30124. And a two-year-old or one-year-old?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",21
"22","—It is only two or three months.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",22
"23","3012.5. He has only a cow and a calf ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",23
"24","—Yes.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",24
"25","30126. No other beast ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",25
"26","—No.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",26
"27","30127. Do you know how many cattle are kept in the township altogether?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",27
"28","—Some of them keep more in the winter, and put them to grass with the sheep farmer in summer time.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",28
"29","30128. Do people keep more stock in winter than they do in summer?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",29
"30","—Yes; some of them.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",30
"31","30129. What do they do with these extra cattle in summer?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",31
"32","—Send them to grass to the big farms wherever they can get grazing.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",32
"33","30130. So that you have wintering for more cattle than you have summering for?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",33
"34","—Some of those who keep the extra stock have to buy winter keep for them in addition to their own produce.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",34
"35","30131. Are there any of the crofters who keep extra stock in winter?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",35
"36","—Some buy cattle and others rear them; and then they buy from neighbouring tenants, in order to feed them in winter.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",36
"37","30132. So that the arable ground is more than sufficient to winter the stock allowed by their summing to be kept on the hill pasture ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",37
"38","—Nobody need understand that; although there is land for them to stand on, it will feed them in winter without buying.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",38
"39","30133. But in point of fact the arable ground is more than sufficient to winter the stock which you are allowed by your summing to keep on the hill pasture ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",39
"40","—No, it is not the fact that we have more arable land than will support our proportion of cattle for the summer grazing.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",40
"41","30134. If you buy cattle to keep in winter, surely that implies that you are able to keep extra stock in winter?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",41
"42","—We have byre room for them and outrun room for them to stand on, but not to feed them; but we are entitled to buy food for them.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",42
"43","30135. Do you think the rents which you pay are too high?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",43
"44","—I say that the rents are too high in comparison with the big sheep farms or tacks; but, per se, I don't consider they are too high.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",44
"45","30136. That is, compared with the usual crofting rents in the district?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",45
"46","—Yes.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",46
"47","30137. I suppose what you really want is this additional farm to enable you to summer more stock ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",47
"48","—Yes.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",48
"49","30138. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",49
"50","—Is it not really the fact that the value of an animal may increase from the time you purchase it until the time you sell it, and that you buy cattle and keep them in order to turn an honest penny ? Is not that what you mean by taking in these pasture beasts and paying for their food?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",50
"51","—Yes.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",51
"52","30139. And the croft itself really affords nothing to that animal except the standing room of the byre ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",52
"53","—The summing of the place is one cow and calf, and the extra cattle have no right to be there; only we agree among ourselves to tolerate each other for having an extra one.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",53
"54","30140. Does it harm the proprietor or anybody in any way when you buy a beast and buy its food from other quarters ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",54
"55","—I am not aware that it is any loss.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",55
"56","30141. What is the name of the small farm adjoining what you would like ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",56
"57","—Knockgorm.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",57
"58","30142. Do you know what rent is paid for that farm by Messrs Brown ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",58
"59","—£60.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",59
"60","30143. Have the Messrs Brown got a great deal of land in this country ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",60
"61","—They have land in Kilellan, but not so much as they used to have; part of it was made into deer forest.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",61
"62","30144. Have they a good deal yet?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",62
"63","—I believe they have",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",63
"64","30145. Quite enough to enable them to dispense with this small piece at any rate ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",64
"65","—Yes, if they were so inclined.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",65
"66","30146. Do you think that you or your father and the other crofters are quite able, if you get this land, to take it and do it as much justice as this non-resident sheep farmer?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",66
"67","—Yes, if we got it at a reasonable rent.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",67
"68","30147. How would you like to get this reasonable rent fixed?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",68
"69","—By comparison with the big sheep farms about.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",69
"70","30148. You are willing to give acre for acre?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",70
"71","—Yes, according to the rental paid by the big sheep farms in the parish.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",71
"72","30149. You don't want to hurt the proprietor by this request ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",72
"73","—No, it cannot hurt him.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",73
"74","30150. You would not like to hurt him ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",74
"75","—No.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",75
"76","30151. Is he a good landlord ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",76
"77","—Yes ; but I would hardly know him although I met him on the road.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",77
"78","30152. What is the name of the son of the factor who wanted to get the farm from your predecessors ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",78
"79","—I think it was William M'Lennan.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",79
"80","30153. Where is he?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",80
"81","—He went abroad, I think.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",81
"82","30154. Did he ever get the farm ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",82
"83","—No.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",83
"84","30155. Who got it when the people lost it?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",84
"85","—Mr Brown of Kilellan.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",85
"86","30156. Was that all before Sir Alexander Matheson came ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",86
"87","—It was for some years in the hands of the proprietor himself, and I believe it is since Sir Alexander came that Mr Brown got it.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",87
"88","30157. Did the people in the township make any direct application to the proprietor or factor when they heard that Mr Brown was willing to give it up ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",88
"89","—They went to the factor, Mr Watson, who promised to represent their wish to the proprietor, but whether he did so or not we have not heard since.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",89
"90","30158. What do you do yourself besides farming—are you a fisherman?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",90
"91","—Yes.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",91
"92","30159. Do you earn most of your living by the sea ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",92
"93","—The whole",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",93
"94","30160. The Chairman.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",94
"95","—Do you remember the trees being planted upon the hill ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",95
"96","—Yes.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",96
"97","30161. Did that give a good deal of employment to the people?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",97
"98","—Yes, they did get a good deal of employment then ; but there were local factors in this district who would give them employment. But since then matters are chanced, and now no one can get employment of any importance except strangers.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",98
"99","30162. Was there any draining done in connection with the planting ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",99
"100","— Yes.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",100
"101","30163. Has there been any employment given in connection with keeping the drains open and thinning the wood ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",101
"102","—Yes, thinning the wood. ",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",102
"103","30164. Is the wood well fenced, or has the fence been now thrown down ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",103
"104","—It is up round some parts of the wood, and in other places it is broken down.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",104
"105","30165. Is the ground inside the wood pastured?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",105
"106","—There was one part taken from us formerly, and we have got authority this year to pasture cattle inside that part of the wood.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",106
"107","30166. Is the pasture inside the wood as good as outside on the hill ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",107
"108","—No.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",108
"109","30167. Are you paying additional rent for pasture in the wood, or do you get it gratis?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",109
"110","—I cannot say ; we only got it at the last term.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",110
"111","30168. What stock did you put into the wood?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",111
"112","—Nothing extra.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",112
"113","30169. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",113
"114","—At what fishing are you engaged ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",114
"115","—The east coast fishing at Peterhead.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",115
"116","30170. Is that fishing not going on at this moment ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",116
"117","—Yes, but I did",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",117
"118","not go.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",118
"119","30171. What employment are you engaged in this year?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",119
"120","—Nothing.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",120
"121","30172. Is it from want of health that you are not employed?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",121
"122","—I am quite healthy.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",122
"123","30173. If you are not living by your croft, nor by fishing, how are you living?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",123
"124","—That is a question I am not bound to answer to anybody.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",124
"125","30174. You come here as a crofter's representative; what have you to do with the croft ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",125
"126","—That I work it every year.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",126
"127","30175. Have you any brothers working at it too?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",127
"128","—My other brother was working along with me on the croft",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",128
"129","30176. Professor Mackinnon.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",129
"130","—You have between you in the eight crofts and the mill croft forty acres of arable land which you cultivate: how much has your father ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",130
"131","—Three acres, as far as I am concerned.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",131
"132","30177. There are three who pay a higher rent than the others; how much arable land will they have ? ",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",132
"133","—Something about the same, or maybe four acres.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",133
"134","30178. How do they pay higher rent ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",134
"135","—They have more pasture.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",135
"136","30179. Is not the pasture common?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",136
"137","—No, the pasture is separate.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",137
"138","30180. And is the pasture of each separately enclosed?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",138
"139","—Yes.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",139
"140","30181. Whether is your pasture ground or arable ground the larger and wider?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",140
"141","—They are much about the same.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",141
"142","30182. And your summing is one cow and a stirk ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",142
"143","—Yes.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",143
"144","30183. Do you sell the stirk ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",144
"145","—Yes, sell it when it is a year old.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",145
"146","30184. And you never keep more than that stock on the summing?-",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",146
"147","—Some years they keep them on the sheep farm.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",147
"148","30185. I mean within your own pasture?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",148
"149","—No.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",149
"150","30186. But if your own ground is separately enclosed it does not really very much matter whether you keep extra stock or not; it is your loss if you don't keep it, and not your neighbours' loss ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",150
"151","—They are divided into two sections, and each has not a separate pasture at all ; the pasture is in common in two divisions.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",151
"152","30187. But you don't keep more than your summing in summer upon the common pasture ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",152
"153","—No, it would not carry them.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",153
"154","30188. How about the wintering? Your crofts yield a crop that could winter more beasts than there is summer pasture for?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",154
"155","—Yes.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",155
"156","30189. In that respect, if you had more summer pasture you would go on with the crofts as you are and winter more cattle ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",156
"157","—They would keep as much again as we have summer grazing for.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",157
"158","30190. There was a far greater amount of stock upon the ground last winter than there was summer grazing for; were the people of Avernish able upon their own crofts, without going outside to buy anything, to winter the whole of their stock ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",158
"159","—No, some of them had to buy; that is according to the labour they do in the spring time in the way of putting on manure, sea-weed, &c.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",159
"160","30191. But if the crofts were well cultivated in an average year, would they winter the stock yon had last year?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",160
"161","—I could not say.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",161
"162","30192. Off and on?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",162
"163","—Well, the place is so small that nobody hardly can wait to lose that much time in the spring as to put the place in order.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",163
"164","30193. Suppose you got the place you are wanting, is it sheep stock you would put on, or cattle and sheep ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",164
"165","—Cattle altogether, as far as I am concerned.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",165
"166","30194. Is there arable ground upon the farm you wish to get?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",166
"167","—It is all arable land; the most of it is arable land.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",167
"168","30195. What stock is on it just now?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",168
"169","—200 sheep, I believe.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",169
"170","30196. But you would turn it into arable ground?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",170
"171","—Part of it.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",171
"172","30197. And put cattle upon the grazing?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",172
"173","—Yes.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",173
"174","30198. You don't mean to keep sheep?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",174
"175","—Not so far as I am instructed by the rest.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",175
"176","30199. You expect there is as much ground capable of cultivation upon that place as would winter well the cattle that would graze upon it in summer ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",176
"177","—[reply illegible]",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",177
"178","30200. And you think you and your neighbours would be prepared to give the rent for it that is at present given by one man?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",178
"179","—No, by no means.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",179
"180","30201. Supposing you got it at a reasonable rent, you would be able to stock it ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",180
"181","—We would try and do it.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",181
"182","30202. The whole eight ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",182
"183","—What would become of the four cottars who had none ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",183
"184","30203. I thought you said the crofts you have are not too highly rented looking at themselves alone ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",184
"185","—I don't know whether you would call them highly rented or not; they are very small.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",185
"186","30204. Do you think that this farm is too highly rented?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",186
"187","—I am thinking it is.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",187
"188","30205. Does Mr Brown think it is ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",188
"189","—I don't know; I never asked him.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",189
"190","30206. How would you arrive at what you call a fair rent ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",190
"191","—Take the crofts acre for acre with Auchtertyre or other places.",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",191
"192","30207. You think at present the farm is over-rented ?",511,"Kenneth Finlayson","Ross-shire, Balmacara",192
