"1","DONALD MACRAE, Crofter, Camuslongart (56)—examined.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",1
"2","31162. The Chairman.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",2
"3","—Were you elected a delegate ?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",3
"4","—Yes.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",4
"5","31163. Have you any statement to make on behalf of your township?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",5
"6","—Yes.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",6
"7","—' Statement by the Crofters of Camuslongart, in the Parish of Lochalsh. In this place there are eight crofters and two cottars, occupying each from three and a half to four and a half English acres or thereabouts of land of very inferior quality. Before our fathers were removed to it, it formed a part of a township occupied by small tenants. It is composed partly of moss and partly of gravelly soil and rock, and was mostly covered with heather. When Lettre, Conchra, and Braigh-an-tratha were, in the time of Sir Hugh Innes, given to one man, some of the people were removed to this poor place. Our Complaints.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",7
"8","—The smallness of our holdings, and, considering the poor quality of the soil, and the improvement made was by ourselves, and also that we have no claim for compensation, the rent is too high. We have no outside grazing for cows or any other beast. We keep a cow each on the crofts; but during the summer and autumn seasons they must be tethered or herded, each his own cow, which requires eight individuals. No followers can be kept. We pay 7s. 6d. for peats either in money or labour, and 9s. to neighbours for sea-ware for planting potatoes. All burdens must be carried on our backs—doing horses' work. The remedy for this is to grant more land, especially more pasture, where we could keep cows with their followers, and a few sheep, which would be of great benefit to families. Emigration has not, in any case we know, improved the condition of the remanent population or those who remained in the country. The reverse was the result. In many they were reduced to poverty, their lands being added to large sheep farms.'",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",8
"9","31164. Who was this letter written by?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",9

"14","—-It was written by instructions of the people.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",14
"15","31167. After the minister had written the paper did he read it over?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",15
"16","—The people could not understand it in English; but they believe it is according to what thay wished him to put in Gaelic.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",16
"17","31168. Did the minister translate it into Gaelic to you?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",17
"18","—He had no time to re-translate back to the Gaelic what he put in.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",18
"19","31169. But you have faith that the minister has written what you said ?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",19
"20","—Yes.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",20
"21","—[Rev. Mr M'Call, Free Church minister, Lochalsh]. ",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",21
"22","That statement was dictated by the people, and I explained to them in Gaelic, and asked if that was all they wanted.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",22
"23","31170. Your demand is for more land ?—where can you get more land ?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",23
"24","—[Donald Macrae]. There is plenty of land in Conchra.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",24
"25","31171. Could it be given near your own place, or would you have to be transported with your family to another place ?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",25
"26","—We are near enough it already.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",26
"27","31172. Do you mean adjacent to it?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",27
"28","—Adjacent.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",28
"29","31173. Is it to be taken off the farm?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",29
"30","—Yes, off the big farm. There is no other place.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",30
"31","31174. But the factor said it would spoil the big farm to give it off?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",31
"32","—It is certain it would make a change upon it.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",32
"33","31175. But do you think that some of the farm would still be left ?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",33
"34","—Yes, plenty would be left for the man.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",34
"35","31176. You say that emigration has not, in any case that yon know of, improved the people's  condition ; when the people emigrate and go away, what becomes of the land they leave behind them?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",35
"36","—The bulk of it has been given to one man, and put under sheep.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",36
"37","31177. Did you ever know any case in which the land of an emigrant was added to the land of somebody who remained behind ?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",37
"38","—Yes, some in Ardcloe.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",38
"39","31178. Then emigration sometimes does some good to those who remain behind ?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",39
"40","—Very little good it has done to us as yet.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",40
"41","31179. Do the emigrants not sometimes do well in the new country?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",41
"42","—Very few have come back to help the country of those who have left.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",42
"43","31180. But perhaps they don't come back because they are so well off in the other country ?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",43
"44","—Although they would return they would get not a turf of land for a site for a house.",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",44
"45","31181. If you were a young man again, and had a good chance, would not you go to Australia or America ?",522,"Donald Macrae","Ross-shire, Balmacara",45
