"1","RODERICK M'SWEEN, Crofter, Steinish (77)—examined.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",1
"2","16616. Professor Mackinnon.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",2
"3","—You have a statement to submit to the Commissioners ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",3
"4","—Yes.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",4
"5","—Statement of Crofters. Grievances from the Township of Steinish, in the parish of Stornoway, for submission to the Royal Commission, 6th June 1883.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",5
"6","—Gentlemen, We are poor ignorant men, and would humbly lay our grievances in brevity before you for redress and remedy. These are, viz., that the proprietor deprived us of 120 acres of agricultural ground and moor pasture, of which he gave, without any reduction of rent to us, 19 acres to Mrs Houston, a large farmeress at Melbost, and 50 acres to one Mr Simon Fraser (who came here a total stranger), who rents the same at £11 sterling. Roderick M'Sween, the eldest man in the said township, and the longest crofter paying rent for forty-three years past, remembers well of the previous rent having been £30, 17s., whereas it is now £41—thus giving an increase in rental of £10, 3s. (see Appendix A. XL). After the deprivation of the great extent of land taken from us, the proprietor has given the best part of our township to others without our consent, namely, 8 acres to J. Leadingham, 30 acres to George Mackenzie, besides the Tongue of Tong, the best grazing we had, to Mr Grant, a large sheep, &c, farmer. These are only a few out of many of our grievances, which we would humbly submit to your Commission; but as brevity must be observed, we will presently close with the last but not least hardship to which we have been subjected, and which is a shame and disgrace in a Christian country—that is the bona fide fact, the impossibility of getting a road to our burial ground without trespass and scaling a dyke six feet high with our dead for interment, although we have been paying taxes and road assessment for the whole period of our occupancy of our present crofts or lots. We shall be glad to appear before you, and in our own humble and illiterate manner answer any questions you may be pleased to ask us; and hoping you will be the cause of redressing our grievances and ameliorating our poor condition, we have the honour to be, gentlemen, your most obedient servants, the crofters of Steinish, near Stornoway. Per RODERICK M'SWEEN and MURDO M'LENNAN.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",6
"7","16617. Who wrote the paper you now submit ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",7
"8","—Mr Walter Rose.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",8
"9","16618. Was it read to you before?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",9
"10","—It was the people of the place who put down what was put into that paper by Mr Rose.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",10
"11","16619. So that you know yourself quite well what is in the paper?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",11
"12","—Yes.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",12
"13","16620. How many people are in that place paying rent ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",13
"14","—Fourteen at present pay rent",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",14
"15","16621. How much rent do they pay ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",15
"16","—Upwards of £40. I came there forty-three years ago, and there were eight lots then.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",16
"17","16622. You say that 120 acres of agricultural ground and moorland pasture were taken from you first, and you got no reduction of rent for that. When was this done ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",17
"18","—It is thirty-three years at least since most of it was taken from us.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",18
"19","16623. And then there were nineteen acres given to Mrs Houston ; when was that ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",19
"20","—About the same time. I was at sea at the time.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",20
"21","16624. And the fifty acres given to Mr Fraser,—was that at the same time ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",21
"22","—All at the same time.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",22
"23","16625. And in none of the cases was there any reduction of rent ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",23
"24","—No.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",24
"25","16626. Now, you say the rent has been increased by £ 10 during the last forty-three years. Does that mean that the £ 10 includes taxes ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",25
"26","—Yes.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",26
"27","16627. So the actual rent has not increased so much as that ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",27
"28","—No.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",28
"29","16628. You said that the proprietor gave without your consent eight acres to Mr Leadingham; when was that?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",29
"30","—A long time ago. I cannot mention the date. I was at sea at the time.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",30
"31","16629. And thirty acres to Mr George Mackenzie; and no reduction of rent ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",31
"32","—Eight acres of the thirty were given to Mr Mackenzie in Lady Hood's time, and the rest in Sir James' time.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",32
"33","16630. With regard to the grievance about the churchyard, it is stated in the paper here that there is no road to the burial ground except by scaling a dyke six feet high with your dead for interment. Is that the only place where the people of your township bury their dead ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",33
"34","—Our burying place is at Uy.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",34
"35","16631. But is this place also used by the people for burying their dead ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",35
"36","—The complaint is not that the chuchyard is surrounded by a six feet wall without a gate, but that there is a six feet wall near our own house on the road—the only road we can conveniently go to the churchyard. ",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",36
"37","16632. But suppose there was a gate on that wall, you would require a road through the farm to the churchyard ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",37
"38","—Yes.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",38
"39","16633. Was that the way you used to go long ago?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",39
"40","—Yes; that was the regular burying place.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",40
"41","16634. Is this a grievance that affects other people as well as your township ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",41
"42","—It affects only our township. The others can go by another way.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",42
"43","16635. Did you endeavour to get a gate put upon the wall to allow you to go to the churchyard?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",43
"44","—There was a gate, but in order to prevent the possible access of a beast through that gate into the parks, the gate was broken down, and the entrance closed up.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",44
"45","16636. Have you made any endeavour to get that gate restored ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",45
"46","—I did not like to trouble the factor, but the ground officer was spoken to this year about it.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",46
"47","16637. What did he say?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",47
"48","—I do not know what he said. It was somebody else who spoke to him and not myself. The conversation occurred at a funeral at which the ground officer was present.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",48
"49","16638. In regard to your crofts, what is it the people in your place would wish to be done ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",49
"50","—When I came to Steinish forty-three years ago, I was paying £4, 4s. of rent. I had four milk cows then. It is thirtythree years since the pasture I have mentioned was taken from us, and now I can scarcely maintain one cow. Two cows are the most that any crofter in the place keeps, and it is as much as they can do to keep them.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",50
"51","16639. How would you put these matters right?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",51
"52","—What the people want is more grass for their cattle, and the arable land which they lost. They require kitchen with their food as well as the food itself—milk and butter, and clothing to clothe themselves.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",52
"53","16640. Do you think the place is large enough to support the whole fourteen of you—the land you had before?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",53
"54","—We would be very well contented with it.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",54
"55","16641. The rent has increased, but chiefly by taxation. You don't complain that the rent is too high ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",55
"56","—I know it is too high.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",56
"57","16642. You yourself pay £4 ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",57
"58","—I pay £4, 12s. 6d. besides taxes.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",58
"59","16643. What rent do you think would be a fair rent for your croft without taxes ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",59
"60","—If it was at the same rent at which we had it before we  would be content that is £4, 4s. with the pasture land restored.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",60
"61","16644. Is it good land that you have?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",61
"62","—It is not bad land at all; we are not complaining of the land.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",62
"63","16645. Would it be easy to give you back what you had before?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",63
"64","—It is easy enough, if they liked to give it to us.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",64
"65","16646. Why was it taken away ; was it that the boundaries would be easier marked, or what ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",65
"66","—I cannot answer that.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",66
"67","16647. You know the boundaries of the place well enough; were the boundaries more natural in the old time than now ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",67
"68","—The boundaries that are now between us and the tack were made at the time when the tack was erected. The dyke was made close to our doors when that land was taken from us. A boy standing at any of the doors in our township, in the centre, could easily throw a stone to the boundary on the one side and to that on the other.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",68
"69","16648. So if the old boundaries were renewed again, do you think the fourteen families could live upon the old land in comfort in your place ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",69
"70","—Yes.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",70
"71","16649. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",71
"72","—What is the name of the tack on the one side ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",72
"73","—Goramclete.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",73
"74","16650. And what is the name of the tack on the other side?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",74
"75","—The other tack is Mr Simon Fraser's, and it has no other name than that of Steinish.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",75
"76","16651. Was that fence put up entirely for the advantage of those two tacks, and to the loss of the crofters?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",76
"77","—These dykes were erected entirely for the benefit of the tacks on each side. We were deprived of our peat moss at the same time.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",77
"78","16652. In regard to this wall keeping you from the churchyard, is the road on the other side of the dyke along to the churchyard destroyed ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",78
"79","—It is not destroyed, it is as good as ever.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",79
"80","16653. That is on your own side, but on the other side what is it?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",80
"81","—There is a part of the ground on that side—the tacksman's side—where there never was a road ; but beyond that the road is as it was.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",81
"82","16654. Is it a very old burial ground?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",82
"83","—The oldest churchyard in Lewis. It is called Aignish.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",83
"84","16655. Do you know it is illegal by the law of Scotland to shut up any road leading to a churchyard or to a church ?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",84
"85","—I believe it is.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",85
"86","16656. And if so, why did you permit this?",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",86
"87","—Because we were very peaceable, and preferred to bear it rather than put other people to trouble.",302,"Roderick Mcsween","Lewis, Stornoway",87
