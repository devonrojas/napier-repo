"1","JOHN MAXWELL, Crofter, Housebay, Stronsay, assisted by DAVID SMITH, Housebay, Stronsay (42)—examined.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",1
"2","23021. The Chairman.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",2
"3","—Make your statement.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",3
"4","—First, as to living.We are bound to furnish a woman hirer for each croft, to work on the farm of Housebay for six months in the year. The wages each hirer earns is paid to herself, while we have to find her in board and lodgings during that time, with the exception of about five weeks in harvest when they are furnished with their ""cost"" by the tenant of Housebay. Again, we are each bound to furnish the tenant of Housebay with a man labourer during the harvest weeks, when he receives his wages and ""cost"" from Housebay, while we are bound to find him in lodgings. Again, we are each bound in addition to the above to find during the harvest weeks a third hirer, to cook food and carry the same to the other two to the field, as the distance from the crofts is such as not to admit of time for the other two to come home to their meals, the time allowed for each meal being one hour, the labourers thus having to take their meals in the open air. This third hirer we have both to pay lodgings and board at our own cost. The Commissioners will thus see how hard this system of hiring must press on us in our small crofts, when we with a few exceptions have to buy meal for ourselves, families, and the Housebay hirers for most of six months in the year. Second, as to rent: The crofters are well and - all highly rented, in fact the rents have been several times raised, and we have been told by the factors, that we either had to take them at the rents or leave them.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",4

"16","23027. How were you allowed to take in from the common?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",16

"44","23041. Are you able to raise sufficient food for your family and your cattle?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",44

"46","23042. How is it you can keep only one cow?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",46

"68","—Yes, but we require to be at home well and to manage our crofts. ",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",68
"69","23053. Are you all able to live off your crofts without fishing?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",69
"70","—Scarcely, I suppose. My family is quite small now, and I put by with the bread I have; but everyone does not do that.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",70
"71","23054. Do you hold the land from the tenant for whom you are obliged to work?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",71
"72","—No, but these labourers work to the tenant.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",72

"77","23057. Do you consider it a grievance that the labourers have to take their meals in the open air?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",77
"78","—Yes, it is the usual custom.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",78
"79","23058. And do you complain of it?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",79
"80","—I cannot say much about it.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",80
"81","23059. Is it not the custom all over Scotland and England for outdoor labourers to take their food in the open air?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",81

"85","23061. It is having to carry food?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",85

"88","—I never took that to a close account.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",88
"89","23063. What would you give to be freed from this burden —how much money?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",89
"90","—If we were freed from that, we would still be high enough rented.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",90
"91","23064. Would you rather than a couple of pounds be freed from this burden?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",91
"92","—It would be better.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",92
"93","23065. Do you all complain of your rents?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",93
"94","—I think the most of us have reason to do so.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",94
"95","23066. Is your rent one of the highest?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",95
"96","—Well, I reckon that myself.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",96
"97","23067. Is there any one who pays more rent than you?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",97

"104","exceptions.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",104

"106","—[Maxwell]. Yes.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",106
"107","23071. For whom do you make it?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",107
"108","—The proprietor.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",108
"109","23872. How are you paid?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",109
"110","—We have £2, 5s. per ton.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",110
"111","23073. What time does it take you to make a ton?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",111
"112","—It is altogether according to the weather; in dry weather we may make it in a short time, but in wet weather it may lie a month on the beach.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",112
"113","23074. What have you made this year?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",113
"114","—Very little. The weather was wet, and it wastes away, and does not come to anything in that case.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",114
"115","23075. Mr Cameron.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",115

"117","—Yes.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",117
"118","23076. When were they last raised?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",118

"121","—Maybe six or seven years.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",121
"122","23078. What was the reason given for raising the rents at that time""!",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",122
"123","—They thought we had too good a bargain.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",123

"132","23083. You got no additional land and no house built?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",132
"133","—No.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",133
"134","23084. And nothing was done for you when the rent was raised?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",134
"135","—Nothing.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",135
"136","23085. Is that the case with the other crofters?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",136
"137","—Yes.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",137
"138","23086. What do you sell off the croft each year?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",138

"140","23087. What do you get for the two-year-okl?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",140

"146","23090. What do you get for it?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",146

"148","23091. That is about all you sell off the croft?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",148

"153","—That differs very much.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",153
"154","23094. Do you think that you are high rented because you don't get enough out of your croft, or is it that you think you are high rented compared with the rent you paid sometime ago?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",154

"161","23097. How much?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",161

"184","—I do. ",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",184
"185","23109. If you had to pay it at all would you prefer to pay it in money? ",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",185
"186","—I pay the greater part of it in money. ",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",186
"187","23110. But you would prefer to pay it to the landlord directly?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",187
"188","—I do pay it to the proprietor or his factor.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",188
"189","23111. I mean the money you have to pay for the servant for the big farm, would you not prefer to compound with the landlord?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",189
"190","—It would be far better.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",190
"191","23112. You don't like this burden at all?",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",191
"192","—No, I don't.",399,"John Maxwell, David Smith","Orkney, Sanday",192
