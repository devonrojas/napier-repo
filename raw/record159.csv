"1","JOHN ROBERTSON, Esq., Farmer and Factor, Grishornish (60)—examined",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",1
"2","(See Appendix A. XVII) ",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",2
"3","8746. The Chairman.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",3
"4","— You are a factor?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",4
"5","—I am factor for my son and for the Glendale trustees.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",5
"6","8747. Do you wish to make any statement to us?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",6
"7","—Well, I have taken some notes. At the meeting at Skeabost there was a case mentioned by John Bethune, who stated that when I was factor at Skeabost a man was fined £4, 10s. for the keep of a horse. I want to explain that I was not factor for the late Mr Macleod of Grishornish at that time, but I occasionally gave him assistance. I am not aware of any case of the kind. I believe there was a case where a man was charged £1 a year for the grazing of a horse, and that is the only case I am aware of. I would like to refer to the matter of Edinbane and what happened at Dunvegan.Murdo M'Lean made several complaints as to my management of the Grishornish property, to which I wish to reply. I may preface it by stating that I have had charge of the property for fourteen years. During that time I have not increased the rental of this township. I have not evicted a single tenant. I have not encroached upon the hill grazings nor taken an inch of their arable lands from them. M'Lean states that I increased the rent of one crofter for taking a lodger, who he admitted was a hawker. He should have added, that it was for harbouring tinkers and becoming a nuisance to the neighbours that the rent was raised. He next charged me with increasing the rent of another crofter 10s. for quarrelling with his neighbour. He should have said fighting with his neighbour, and being otherwise troublesome to the crofters adjoining his land. Both crofters in 1882 had this increase taken off, and the rents made the same as before. The crofter who had his rent slightly increased for selling part of his crop ofF the property knew that by the rules of the estate he could sell it to any of the crofters or to any one on the property, and he had no excuse for refusing to comply with the rules. This crofter and four others had been paying less rent than the other eighteen crofters who had half lots, and as they had about the same quantity of arable land, and were allowed the same summing of cattle, and received an equal share of the sheep profits, I considered they were bound to pay the same rent; and as two or three of the crofters had been complaining of paying more than the others, I reduced them, and made all as nearly as possible alike. These changes reduced the rental of the township £ 1 , 4s., as will be seen by comparing the valuation roll of 1881 with that of 1882. I may here state that the late Mr Macleod of Grishornish, about twenty years ago, assisted six families to emigrate from the township, purchasing lands for them in America. He then removed the crofters of Kerrol, taking the vacant lands of Kerrol and Bendhu into his own hands. He expended a large amount of money in draining and trenching parts of these lands, and put up houses for the cottars of Bendhu. The rest of the lands he had under cultivation; and I may also mention that he erected on these lands the Gesto Hospital, and left it handsomely endowed for the benefit of the people of Skye, and Murdo M'Lean's brother lately received some of its benefits. This was the state of matters when I received charge of the property for my son, who is a minor, and as I have said, I have made no change on the croftersholdings since. The houses were built by the crofters, and I have not interfered with them, nor have I interfered with the cropping of the land, but I have interested myself in the management of the stock of sheep. I purchased shares of these sheep, and I gave shares to those who had none, or who had not a full share, so as to make all equal in holding half or whole shares; I assisted at sales of their sheep and lambs, not even charging outlays, and the result is that for fourteen years the average profit has been £6 per share. A complaint has been made relative to the bank interest. The payments for sheep and lambs are as often made after the term as before it, as you will see by the past year's account, which I now produce. Besides, the bank only allows 1 or 1½ per cent, on current account, and though all the money was paid in two months before the'account closed, the interest would not amount to more than 5s. This year the difference is on my side. M'Lean states also that only 100 or 120 lambs are usually sold.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",7
"8","That is not correct. As you wLU see from the paper, 192 lambs were sold last year, and seldom under 180. Horses are not included in the summing, and no rent for them is paid. The charge of 10s. for each is divided amongst the crofters. I do not interfere in the sale of their cattle, and though I frequently ask them to give me the first offer of any animal they have for sale, it makes no difference whether they do so or rot. I can buy from strangers as a rule on better terms. My keeping a meal store also appears to be a grievance, but as I expend in labour £600 or £700 annuaHy, I require a store to supply my engaged servants and other workers with their ordinary allowance of meal The store is open to any of the tenants who may want a supply, but I never asked any one of them to take meal from the store, and I have often cautioned my manager not to give them so much. Our prices for the past two years have been 20s. or 21s. per boll cash, and 22s. credit —except for four months —last July, August, September, and October—when it was 6d. per boll more, owing to the prices in the south being higher. Another delegate from Edinbane says that the crofters there had only four boats. I find, however, they have fourteen good sea-going boats. I think I have shown that the complaints made are groundless, and are not correct. I may just state that Murdo M'Lean and his brother have got upwards of £70 from me for draining during the last three or four years. These are my statements in reply to the complaints made, and I exhibit a letter from the banker showing the rate of interest.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",8
"9","8748. We understand from you that for the last fourteen years there have been no evictions?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",9
"10","—For a much longer period, but that is during my time.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",10
"11","8749. And during the same time there has been no increase of rental Robertson, on the crofters?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",11
"12","—None; as a whole, there have been a few shillings put on to equalise lower rents.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",12
"13","8750. And during that period has there been any subdivision of the crofts?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",13
"14","—No.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",14
"15","8751. You mentioned that at a previous time six crofters were supplied with the means of emigration, and provided with land in America. Will you kindly state what intelligence you have respecting the fate of these people since they settled in America?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",15
"16","—They have been successful.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",16
"17","8752. All the six?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",17
"18","—So I understand.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",18
"19","8753. In what part of the country did they settle?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",19
"20","—In Canada. There is a gentleman here who can tell all about them.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",20
"21","—Rev. Mr Darrock. I have only to say that I happened to be in Canada at the time, and I saw the parties. They landed there, stopping on farms purchased for them by Mr Macleod of Grishornish, and most of them remained there in my time, but some of them were going further west, and getting land for themselves. They settled there on lands provided for them by Mr Macleod until such time as I understood they could purchase laud for themselves, and they seemed to be very much pleased indeed with the country.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",21
"22","8754. Did they ever express any regret that they had left this country?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",22
"23","—No, never.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",23
"24","8755. Were they supplied with clothes and passage money by the proprietor?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",24
"25","—Mr Robertson. They were.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",25
"26","—Rev. Mr Darrock. They seemed to be well clothed at all events.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",26
"27","—Mr Robertson. We purchased the lands in addition.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",27
"28","8756. Have you any statement to make about Glendale?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",28
"29","—No, unless you have any questions to put to me in reference to it.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",29
"30","8757. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",30
"31","—One of the complaints by the people who were here was, that they did not know the proper state of the accounts. You have now handed in an account; did you always give a copy of this to the people?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",31
"32","—Yes.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",32
"33","8758. I do not observe the interest you refer to credited here?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",33
"34","—There is no interest in the account, except against some advances for wool.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",34
"35","8759. But they seem to think that there was some interest coming to you from the bank?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",35
"36","—No part of the money for the sheep was paid to me till 13th March, so that the account is rather in my favour than against me.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",36
"37","8760. The interest is in your favour?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",37
"38","—Yes.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",38
"39","8761. The Chairman.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",39
"40","—You mean there ought to be a payment to you rather than to them?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",40
"41","—Quite so.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",41
"42","8762. Sheriff Nicolson.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",42
"43","—There was also a complaint about a prohibition to take shell fish?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",43
"44","—There was none except against taking oysters. I have a lease of the beds of oysters and mussels, and they make a handle of that.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",44
"45","8763. You don't forbid them to take mussels?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",45
"46","—I don't forbid them, but I have a lease for the two.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",46
"47","8764. Is anybody at liberty to take bait off the shore there ?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",47
"48","—Anybody. I do not interfere with them if they do not touch the oysters. I pay a rent of £ 10 to the Board of Trade.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",48
"49","8765. For the oysters?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",49
"50","—Yes.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",50
"51","8766. Have the oysters been increasing since the people were prohibited from taking them?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",51
"52","—Yes, they are increasing.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",52
"53","8767. I suppose before your prohibition they were taking them indiscriminately?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",53
"54","—They were taking them all away at that time.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",54
"55","8768. The Chairman.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",55
"56","—Do you think they would have been exterminated if the people had retained the power of taking them away?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",56
"57","—I believe they would. ",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",57
"58","8769. Are they increasing to be a source of profit?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",58
"59","—They are increasing slowly, and last year was very much better than previous years. ",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",59
"60","8770. Do you offer any for sale?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",60
"61","—I have not offered any for sale yet. I intended to send some to the Exhibition, but I was rather late in doing it.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",61
"62","8771. What is your object? Is it to try to find a new source of profit in the country?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",62
"63","—Yes, an oyster shore ought to be very valuable.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",63
"64","8772. Sheriff Nicolson.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",64
"65","—Is the right to gather periwinkles free to the people?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",65
"66","—Free to the people.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",66
"67","8773. Is there any profitable oyster bank about Skye?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",67
"68","—A great number. There are a great number of oyster banks about Skye.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",68
"69","8774. You do not say they are profitable now?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",69
"70","—I do not think they are very profitable now. They have been cleaned off very much.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",70
"71","8775. Is there a good oyster bed at Skiniden?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",71
"72","—I do not remember.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",72
"73","8776. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",73
"74","—I observe one complaint is that you have two shares of sheep on the hill, and that you do not pay for the grazing?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",74
"75","—I have two shares on the hill, but they belong to that part of the Edinbane township called Kerrol. They have the same right to these two shares that the rest of the town has. There has been no change made by me.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",75
"76","8777. With regard to these two shares?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",76
"77","—No change whatever.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",77
"78","8778. The Chairman.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",78
"79","—I do not distinctly understand about the two shares. The delegates who spoke seemed to imply that you derive a full measure of profit from these shares, and that you do not participate in an equal degree of the expenses?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",79
"80","—I stand in the same position as any one of them. I pay the same share of the expenses, and I hold the arable land of Kerrol in my own hands.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",80
"81","8779. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",81
"82","—How many shares are there altogether in this hill farm?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",82
"83","—Twenty-nine.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",83
"84","8780. And you have two?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",84
"85","—I have two.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",85
"86","8781. And they complain, I understand, that you don't pay for a certain portion of the grazing, and you say that is a separate matter altogether?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",86
"87","—No, the grazing of Kerrol is enclosed. The late Mr Macleod made a sort of model farm, and he kept part of it in grass and cultivation, and had part of it planted. I just keep it in the same way.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",87
"88","8782. Is that the portion they complain of?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",88
"89","—That is the portion they think they should have the run of.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",89
"90","8783. When was that taken from them?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",90
"91","—About twenty years ago, but they were removed from the lands of Kerrol to Edinbane when he sent",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",91
"92","the six away to America, and they got lands that became vacant there instead.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",92
"93","8784. If you have that portion reserved, how is it pastured? You have sheep in common?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",93
"94","—Well, there is a part of it given to the doctor of the hospital, but the sheep go on the hill where all the rest of the sheep are. The sheep don't come down there at all. It is the same as part of the crofts",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",94
"95","—exactly two crofts.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",95
"96","8785. This part, then, you consider exclusively your own?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",96
"97","—It is exclusively the proprietor's. I am acting for my son.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",97
"98","8786. Have they got any grievance, in reality, about this matter?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",98
"99","—I don't think so. I was not aware of it till I heard of it at Dunvegan.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",99
"100","8787. The Chairman.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",100
"101","—You never heard of this grievance before? They never made any representation to you?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",101
"102","—Never. Each share pays £ 10 rent, and receives the same advantages in the hill grazing as the other",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",102
"103","croft that pays £8 rent.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",103
"104","8788. There is another matter, namely, that you raised the rents for the purpose of qualifying them as voters?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",104
"105","—That is nonsense. The election was over before anything of the kind happened, and I had no inducement to do so. It was to equalise them, and, as you will observe from the paper, the changes reduced the rent £1, 4s., and did not, as a whole, increase it. They were all deriving the same amount of profit from the different lots. They had all the same arable land, and received the same summing of cattle.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",105
"106","8789. Do you mean you took it off some and put it on to others?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",106
"107","—I took it off some and put it on to others.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",107
"108","8790. And it is those on whom you put it that are complaining?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",108
"109","—Yes.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",109
"110","8791. And it is incorrect to attribute any such motive to you?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",110
"111","—Quite incorrect.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",111
"112","8792. One of the delegates stated that you distinctly said you put it on because you wanted to make a gentleman of him?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",112
"113","—It is quite possible I may have chaffed him, because at that time there was a little excitement about the election.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",113
"114","8793. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",114
"115","—Where do the common stock winter?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",115
"116","—Over all the ground,",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",116
"117","8794. And do they winter on your arable ground as well as on the crofters arable ground?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",117
"118","—No the lands of Kerrol are fenced off.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",118
"119","8795. That is the complaint of the crofters perhaps —that you do not share in the wintering of their sheep?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",119
"120","—That must have given rise to it.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",120
"121","8796. The Chairman.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",121
"122","—If you wish to make any further statement you are at liberty to do so?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",122
"123","—I have no other statement to make, unless I am asked in reference to Glendale.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",123
"124","8797. Sheriff Nicolson.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",124
"125","—Perhaps you could tell us something about Glendale ",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",125
"126","—I have had very little to do with it.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",126
"127","8798. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",127
"128","—Do you wish of your own accord to make any statement about Glendale?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",128
"129","—There is not very much that I have got to say.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",129
"130","8799. The proprietor, Mr Macpherson, is here to-day; does he wish to make any statement?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",130
"131","—I am not aware.",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",131
"132","8800. You do not wish to volunteer any statement?",159,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",132
