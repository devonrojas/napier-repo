"5","1282. Do you agree with him ? have you the same opinions, or do you wish to add anything ?",21,"Allan Mathieson","Skye, Skeabost",5
"6","—I agree with what he said. I saw my neighbour letting out two stirks in the morning, and these stirks were taken home dead at night owing to the badness of grazing.",21,"Allan Mathieson","Skye, Skeabost",6

"11","—Where is that grazing? is it above or below the road ?",21,"Allan Mathieson","Skye, Skeabost",11
"12","—It is below our crofts in the big moss. Is it not very hard now to be paying heavy rent in such a place as that?",21,"Allan Mathieson","Skye, Skeabost",12
"13","1285. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",21,"Allan Mathieson","Skye, Skeabost",13

"17","—Drowned?",21,"Allan Mathieson","Skye, Skeabost",17
"18","—Yea. I have seen the same man getting a beast out on another occasion, and bringing it home dead from the same place.",21,"Allan Mathieson","Skye, Skeabost",18
"19","1287. The Chairman.",21,"Allan Mathieson","Skye, Skeabost",19

"27","1290. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",21,"Allan Mathieson","Skye, Skeabost",27
"28","—Have you anything else to say?",21,"Allan Mathieson","Skye, Skeabost",28
"29","—We are so much confined in the place; we are so bounded that we have no elbow room on any side, and I may say there are four tacks about us. We are surrounded by four tacks, and shut in by them, so that we have no escape on either side, as if we were shut up iu a fold. We want a slice of hill pasturage that we may have a sheep stock. I have been nearly forty years in the place, and I have not fleeced a sheep, and sometimes I am reduced to twine a thread to darn my stockings for want of wool. It would be very unfair if we do not get a piece of hill pasture.",21,"Allan Mathieson","Skye, Skeabost",29
