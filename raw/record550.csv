"5","The Strath, or village, of Arisaig contains about twenty-six families of very poor people with grievances of its own—such as utter landlessness, excessive rents, and want of constant employment. People do not expect any one to give employment for the mere sake of the labourers ; but these people urge that the families to which many of them belonged were turned out of the better lands where they could employ themselves ; and that, thus, they have a moral right to constant employment at good wages. They would have preferred the freedom to live by the land, and they have a hankering after the land still. But the majority of them are so poor that they cannot face the expenses of a croft without assistance. Cottagers who have strong families might, with the assistance of their friends, make a bold effort to get once more established on the soil. Some say that they could make a shift in their present houses for a time if they got crofts on the near lands. As it is they go far to their precarious employment; and if they got crofts they would go as far to them until they are able to build houses on the ground. This claim of theirs to be allowed to take a living out of the land is supported, in their case, by the circumstances that the very lands which their fathers occupied are just now, in great part, lying in a comparatively unproductive state —some of it under nothing more productive than deer. They make distinct reference to the places which were cleared under the names of Ceann-Coid, Gaoideal, Ardghasairidh, Sandaig, Tor-beithe, Rumach, Acha-gharbh-alt, Auch-na-creige, Am Blàr, Ard-nam-fuaran. The rents on the cottages and houses of these people are exorbitant. If there were plenty of employment and enough of trade people could afford to pay; but with poor trade £12, £13, and £14 are quite out of the question for the houses of the little dealers, and £4, 10s. for bare walls.",550,"Alexander Mcpherson, Alexander Mceachran","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",5

"122","—That is what we desire, according as people can take the land.",550,"Alexander Mcpherson, Alexander Mceachran","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",122

"164","—We have; I have spoken to the whole of them about it.",550,"Alexander Mcpherson, Alexander Mceachran","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",164
