"1","HEW MORRISON, Schoolmaster, Brechin, Forfarshire (33)—examined.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",1
"2","26121. The Chairman.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",2
"3","—Are you a native of this district?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",3
"4","—I am the son of a crofter in Torrisdale, Tongue.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",4
"5","26122. Have you got any written statement?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",5
"6","—I have, but I am afraid it is too long, and the delegates, of whom there are seven, here, asked me to",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",6
"7","make a short statement.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",7
"8","26123. You were elected a delegate?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",8
"9","—I was compelled to become one besides being elected for Tarrisdale and for the Skerray district",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",9
"10","26124. Be so good as to make your verbal statement?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",10
"11","—One  time there were just about twenty crofters in this district of Skerray,  before the general evictions. Now there are eighty. When these twenty  crofters occupied the place they were all very comfortable, and in  evidence of that I may say that my grandfather paid a rent of £14, which  was raised afterwards to £21, which he was very willing to pay, and  paid for many years until the estate passed into the hands of the  Sutherland family when the rent was reduced by thirty per cent. But on  the lotting of the lands three years later he only got oue-fourth of the  holding he previously had, because there were other crofters put into  the same place. He paid £4 for that reduced croft, a rent which has been  paid for the croft ever since. I have been asked to say a few words  regarding the condition of the people. Many of them as they stand at  present have come from Strathnaver, from the farms of Ribigill and  Borgie and were settled on the lands that the original crofters held,  and were told that they could reclaim this land which they could get at a  nominal rent. There was no reduction of the rent of the former tenants  when those people were settled down upon the lands. Fourteen families  were sent from Borgie and Ribigill and got land at the nominal rent of  one shilling. They improved the lands and now pay rents varying from £2,  10s. to £3, 17s. Their condition is wretched, always verging upon  poverty, and they could not keep themselves alive were it not that they  have young men who go to the east coast fishing and elsewhere in the  south, and send home money to pay for meal and provisions which they  require over and above what they are able to raise upon their crofts.  They are hardly able to raise anything on their crofts except in one  way. A crofter who has a horse can hardly make any meal; the only way he  can make meal is when he works the land himself, and turns it with what  is called the casdirach. That instrument—I should like to have shown it  —is the most primitive of all agricultural implements and much  inferior to the caschrom. The soil is poor and the people are not able  to make much of it. Those who till nu the way I have mentioned make a  little meal, but the meal they make is the produce of what they ought to  have given to the horse which ought to work the land. They apply a  great quantity of sea-ware to the land. Then a harbour is greatly wanted  at Skerray. It is a fishing place, and I believe the fishermen there  would be better without crofts, if they were settled simply as a fishing  community.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",11
"12","26125. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",12
"13","—You say Skerray. Is that the same as Port Skerra?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",13
"14","—No,  this Skerray is eighteen miles to the west of Port Skerra. Skerray has  advantages which none of the other two places which have been mentioned  as harbours have. I am anxious there should be harbours in other places,  and I recommended them in a guide book which I published. But Skerray  had advantages as a harbour, and is about an equal distance between Port  Skerra aud Talmin. The number of acres tilled in Skerray is 246; the  number of crofters eighty; and the average rent of each crofter is £3,  7s. The average rental per acre is £1, 2s. During the last forty-one  years there has been no valuation. There has been no rise on the average  rental per acre since, although rents in several cases have been  raised. The people don't complain as Mr Mackay, Tongue, said, of the  amount of the rent so much as of the want of land. There are only among  the eighty crofters 383 sheep, 39 horses —half a horse to each  croft—and 182 head of cattle. In regard to steamboat communication I may  say that I had a correspondence with Mr M'Brayne, and Messrs Langlands,  and both parties said there were no proper landing places on this coast  and that it would not pay to send steamers round, or to add to their  present routes.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",14
"15","26126. Did they give as a reason that there were no piers?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",15
"16","—Mr M'Brayne said that there were no landing places.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",16
"17","26127. We have had some correspondence with the working men's Association at Skerray; what is the nature of that association?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",17
"18","—I  believe that was an association set on foot very much in the same way  as we have debating or literary societies in the south, just for the  sake of getting gentlemen here and there to give public lectures upon  passing subjects and to take up any question and debate it or consider  it among themselves. I believe it was started more with a view to enable  a few of the young men to adapt themselves, or try to adapt themselves,  to public speaking in a better way than they could have done before.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",18
"19","26128. Is English generally spoken in the district?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",19
"20","—Not spoken.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",20
"21","26129. Is it generally understood?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",21
"22","—Yes.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",22
"23","26130. Is there a large centre of population at Skerray where the people can meet together for mutual purposes of cultivation?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",23
"24","—Yes, the population is about 700.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",24
"25","26131. And close together?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",25
"26","—Very close.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",26
"27","26132. Are you a representative of that association or of the crofters?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",27
"28","—Of the crofters.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",28
"29","26133. Has this association sent any delegate here?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",29
"30","—Not as an association.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",30
"31","26134. They have been merely corresponding on behalf of the crofters?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",31
"32","—So I understand.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",32
"33","26135. It is entitled a working men's association; does it mean a labourer's association?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",33
"34","—Anybody may become a member of it in the place; that it is simply a name.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",34
"35","26136. Are there any large farms in the Skerray district?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",35
"36","—Borgie farm is in the district.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",36
"37","26137. And it would be admirably suited for crofters to go back to?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",37
"38","—Very much so, in great measure.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",38
"39","26138. The farm your grandfather had was worth £24; was that arable or pasture land?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",39
"40","—Both, he had not very much arable land, but he had a large outrun of hill pasture extending to the present farm of Borgie.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",40
"41","26139. Was it common pasture?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",41
"42","—Yes, common pasture.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",42
"43","26140. Were other tenants rented at about the same rate as he was?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",43
"44","—Some more and some less.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",44
"45","26141. Have you any idea what stock they kept at that time and what was the character of the stock, of cattle or sheep?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",45
"46","—They kept cattle and sheep and horses, and sometimes they had three or four hill ponies, not very serviceable I should think.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",46
"47","26142. What did your grandfather's sales consist of?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",47
"48","—Cattle and sheep, principally cattle.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",48
"49","26143. The sheep farming was not conducted on the modern system?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",49
"50","—No, on the old crofter system.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",50
"51","26144. If the lands were given back to the crofters would they revert to the old system or would they adopt improved methods?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",51
"52","—I think they would adopt improved methods.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",52
"53","26145. And by doing that you think they could pay as good a rent as the large farmers?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",53
"54","—I think they could pay more.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",54
"55","26146. What reason have you for supposing that?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",55
"56","—I  look upon it in this way, that Strathnaver, for instance, could  accommodate, perhaps, two hundred tenants. Mr Sellar's farm pays a rent  of £1750 or thereby. I believe that two hundred tenants could be  accommodated on that farm who could pay £20 each, including in that the  land of Auchnaburin.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",56
"57","26147. Without outlay on the proprietor's part?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",57
"58","—No, certainly not.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",58
"59","26148. What sort of outlay would the proprietor have to incur in order to get that rental?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",59
"60","—The  outlay would be in lending money to the crofters. If they got money at a  reasonable rate of interest, —and as one of the delegates stated, it  would be far better to give it to them, because they would lay it out to  the best advantage.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",60
"61","26149. But £20 would include interest on this money?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",61
"62","—-Yes, I include that.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",62
"63","26150. How much of the £20 would be interest, and how much for rent?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",63
"64","—Many  crofters could go to Strathnaver —a few from the district of Skerray—if  they got £300 at three per cent, interest, and could improve the land  and build a sort of comfortable residences.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",64
"65","26151. Two hundred tenants, you said, at £20?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",65
"66","—Yes.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",66
"67","26152. If they had each £300 advanced at three per cent.?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",67
"68","—Yes.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",68
"69","26153. That would leave £11 of rent for each?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",69
"70","—Yes.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",70
"71","26154. £2200?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",71
"72","—Yes.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",72
"73","26155. What do Mr Sellar and the other farmer pay for the ground?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",73
"74","—Less than £2000, I understand, but taking the two farms it will be upwards of £3000. There are two sides to the strath.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",74
"75","26156.  Then, after all, as you put it now, the 200 tenants would pay £2200 of  rent, and the rest would be interest on the money advanced, and at a low  rate?",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",75
"76","—Yes; but I think Strathnaver could afford more than that. I am putting it at a very low estimate.",437,"Hew Morrison","Sutherland, Bettyhill",76
