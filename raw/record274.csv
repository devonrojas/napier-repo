"1","ANGUS CAMPBELL, Crofter, North Bragar (57)â€”examined.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",1
"2","15434. The Chairman.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",2
"3","â€”What statement have you to make to the Commission?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",3
"4","â€”That the poverty of the people was caused by overcrowding.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",4
"5","15435. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",5
"6","â€”How many crofters are there on North Bragar ?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",6
"7","â€”Forty-three.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",7
"8","15436. How many were there when you first recollect ?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",8
"9","â€”Twenty-eight crofts. In my father's time there were twenty lots.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",9
"10","15437. How many families ?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",10
"11","â€”Twenty. In my recollection there were twenty-eight crofts, but probably abont thirty-three families.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",11
"12","15438. How did the increase to forty arise?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",12
"13","â€”The greater number of them belonged to the place. A few were sent in upon us from Galston.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",13
"14","15439. How many people came from Galston?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",14
"15","â€”Two.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",15
"16","15440. How long is it since that clearance took place?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",16
"17","â€”About twenty years ago.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",17
"18","15441. Who has got the land?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",18
"19","â€”I do not remember who got it twenty years ago, but at present it is vacant so far as I know. The old tenant has not yet been succeeded.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",19
"20","15442. Is it a big place?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",20
"21","â€”About four miles broad.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",21
"22","15443. How many families would it keep comfortably?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",22
"23","â€”It would keep sixty families comfortably.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",23
"24","15444. Without any hill ground except itself ?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",24
"25","â€”With its own hill pasture just as it is. There are four townships.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",25
"26","15445. What became of the people in these townships?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",26
"27","â€”The greater number of them went to America. Others of them were scattered here and there.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",27
"28","15446. Does this crowding deteriorate the soil?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",28
"29","â€”Yes; we are quite convinced of that. I believe just now the two Bragars are only two miles broad, and there are over 600 souls on them. ",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",29
"30","15447. Is the pasture very much over-eaten ?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",30
"31","â€”The pasture is necessarily injured by over-eating, and it is necessarily exhausted. ",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",31
"32","15448. Do you think your stock has deteriorated in quality in your lifetime?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",32
"33","â€”Yes: it is very nearly worse than if it did not exist at all.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",33
"34","15449. Do you really think that the stock is worse than it nsed to be; is it poorer in quality ?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",34
"35","â€”Yes; it is of worse quality than when I was young.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",35
"36","15450. Is that due to any extent to the fact that you use bad bulls ?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",36
"37","â€”That accounts for it partly, and the inferior pasture accounts for it too. The best of the pasture land we had was settled upon six crofts. Then there was an additional 6s. added on from 1841 to 1843. It has not been put on the last two additions to the township, which were made during Mr Mackay's time. Everything contributes to over-stocking. As the rent is increased, over-stocking follows of necessity. ",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",37
"38","15451. And what you want is that a certain number of families in this township should be removed to other places ?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",38
"39","â€”My croft is only twentynine yards broad, and is about one mile long. ",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",39
"40","15452. But what I want to know is whether you think a certain number of the crofters at North Bragar should be sent to another township or another place ?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",40
"41","â€”That is the only way in which those who remain can be made comfortable.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",41
"42","15453. Would you like to be one of those who would go for the good of their neighbours, or would you rather stay and get ground?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",42
"43","â€”My opinion is that if we had to face such a contingency we would cast lots and deal fairly.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",43
"44","15454. But you wish to have such a contingency to face?",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",44
"45","â€”Yes, we do.",274,"Angus Campbell","Lewis, Barvas ",45
