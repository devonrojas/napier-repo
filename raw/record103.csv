"1","DONALD MARTIN, Crofter, Kylerhea (65), assisted by MALCOLM MACPHERSON (about 60)—examined. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",1
"2","5443. The Chairman.",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",2
"3","—Are you a fisherman ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",3
"4","—Sometimes I fish. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",4
"5","5444. Were you freely elected to be a delegate ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",5
"6","—Yes. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",6
"7","5445. Have you a statement to make on the part of those who chose you?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",7
"8","—That we had at one time our land very much cheaper than we have to day. Our rents were raised twice upon us, and the reason why we had the land less at first was that we were engaged at the ferry at Kylerhea, and all the cattle leaving Uist and Lewis and Skye were ferried across this Kyle. Our land was then rented at only 25s., as we had to be in constant attendance at the ferry. At that time there were neither steamers nor ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",8
"9","trains to relieve us of that work, but now there are both, and we have no work at all; and our land was after that raised twice. Our summing is two cows, but we have to keep one of these upon the stance of the droves, and we can only winter one of them with what grows on our own land. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",9
"10","5446. Have you any horse or sheep ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",10
"11","—Neither. We have to be out 16s. in sea-ware to plant our potatoes. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",11
"12","5447. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",12
"13","—Each of you ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",13
"14","—Yes. There is no seaware on our own land at all. What we have of sea-ware on our land would not plant a bag of potatoes. This man and I are furthest out of our townships, and it is very little of either corn or potatoes or clover that grows on our land that is not consumed by the deer. I may say this is the case with three of us. Our township is not fenced, and we are not able to fence it. The proprietor will not do it. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",14
"15","5448. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",15
"16","—How much has your rent been raised",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",16
"17","— Corrie increased our rents 15s. and Tormore 15s. Our rents are thus double what they were then, and we have only a small bit of ground. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",17
"18","5449. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",18
"19","—How many families are there ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",19
"20","—Thirteen families have land. There are eleven crofters in our township, and the innkeeper has another croft or two. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",20
"21","5450. You stated as a reason why the original rent was so low that you had to work the ferry. Did those who worked the boats draw the toll of the ferry ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",21
"22","—We were getting 6d. for every head of cattle we ferried, and the half of that went to the innkeeper. There were five of us manning the boat, and the threepence was divided among us, except what was charged for grass and oats. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",22
"23","5451. What do you make in a day in the average ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",23
"24","—Since the trains began to take away the stock we get little or nothing. There was one time when we would make £13 or £14 in the year, and now we will not make more than £5. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",24
"25","5452. Are you compelled, at this moment, as part of your condition, to serve at all times at the ferry ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",25
"26","—We must always attend to the ferry. We must be in constant attendance at the ferry. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",26
"27","5453. Whether there are passengers or not ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",27
"28","—We have to be in constant attendance for the ferrying of stock, but not for the ferrying of passengers. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",28
"29","5454. Then, I presume, that does not mean daily attendance ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",29
"30","—There is only ferrying to be done at the market times. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",30
"31","5455. Are you compelled, all the year round, to be present, traffic or no traffic ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",31
"32","—Yes. We have to be in attendance, whether there are markets or not. We are the crew of the boat. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",32
"33","5456. Then your grievance is this, that formerly, before the steamers were coming regularly, when there was a good deal of traffic of that kind, you drew a good deal of wages, and the rents were low; whereas now your rents are high, and the traffic has almost disappeared? ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",33
"34","—Yes. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",34
"35","5457. Mr Cameron.",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",35
"36","—Who pays you for attending to the ferry ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",36
"37","—We are paid just according to the income of the ferry. We get half the dues. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",37
"38","5458. Supposing you refused to attend on those terms, what would happen ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",38
"39","—He would put another person in my place, and he might expel me from my land. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",39
"40","5459. The innkeeper ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",40
"41","—Yes. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",41
"42","5460. Do you hold from the innkeeper ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",42
"43","—We are tenants of Lord Macdonald. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",43
"44","5461. Then how can the innkeeper expel you?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",44
"45","—He might bring in another man who would do his work. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",45
"46","5462. But how would he have power to expel you from the croft, if you hold from Lord Macdonald and not from the innkeeper ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",46
"47","—He had only to say one word to the proprietor that I would not do my work, and another would be put in my place. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",47
"48","5463. Have you ever explained to the proprietor that you are expected to attend constantly at the ferry, and get £5 a year only ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",48
"49","—No. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",49
"50","5464. Don't you think Lord Macdonald would listen to your complaint, and remove the grievance ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",50
"51","—I cannot say anything about that. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",51
"52","5465. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",52
"53","—Would you make more if you were not thirled,—if you were allowed to be a free man, and to work as you liked ? ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",53
"54","—There is no one who is able to work for wages who would not earn more than £5. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",54
"55","5466. Mr Cameron.",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",55
"56","—In regard to the grievance as to the deer, could a fence be erected so as to keep the deer from eating your crops ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",56
"57","—Yes, very easy. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",57
"58","5467. How long would it be ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",58
"59","—About half a mile. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",59
"60","5468. Would that do the whole ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",60
"61","—Yes. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",61
"62","5469. Would that protect the other eleven crofters as well as yourself?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",62
"63","—I do not know but it would need more than that, but the half mile would be scanty. I t would fence our three lots. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",63
"64","5470. Do you think a mile would do the whole township ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",64
"65","—Yes, and less than a mile ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",65
"66","5471. Have you ever asked the factor about this]-",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",66
"67","—I did; I asked Tormore. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",67
"68","5472. Would you be willing to pay a small rate of interest on the cost of the fence ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",68
"69","—Yes, we would. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",69
"70","5473. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",70
"71","—How long is it since the deer began to attack you ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",71
"72","—Twenty or twenty-one years. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",72
"73","5474. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",73
"74","—Are they getting worse ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",74
"75","—Yes, they are coming in tens and twelves about our houses. They are just coming to our doors. They were not there twenty years ago. They consume our corn quite as much as if it were consumed by the muir bird. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",75
"76","5475. The Chairman.",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",76
"77","—Did you ever get any compensation for it ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",77
"78","— No, never. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",78
"79","5476. Did you ever pay anybody to herd the land or protect it ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",79
"80","—No. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",80
"81","5477. What sort of a fence would suit you best,—a stone wall or a wire fence ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",81
"82","—A wire fence. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",82
"83","5478. Do you consider that a wire fence is a better fence for the protection of arable ground than a stone fence ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",83
"84","—With reference to the deer, a wire fence 7 feet high would be a better protection against the deer than a stone dyke. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",84
"85","5479. If a stone dyke were made, 5 feet high, would that be a protection against deer ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",85
"86","—Doubtless it would. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",86
"87","5480. Do you consider generally that a stone fence or a wire fence is better for the protection of arable ground ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",87
"88","—I myself would say that a wire fence was a better protection. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",88
"89","5481. You both concur in that ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",89
"90","—Yes. ",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",90
"91","5482. If the proprietor should put a wire fence to protect your arable ground, would you assist by bringing the materials to the grout, and by assisting so far as you could in placing the fence ?",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",91
"92","—Yes, we would be very glad to do that.",103,"Donald Martin, Malcolm Macpherson","Skye, Isle Ornsay",92
