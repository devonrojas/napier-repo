"1","HUGH CAMERON, Cottar and Sailor, Killean (45)—examined.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",1
"2","37034. Professor Mackinnon.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",2
"3","—How many people in Killean pay rent?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",3
"4","—Ten crofters.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",4
"5","37035. And how many families are there that don't pay rent?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",5
"6","—About twenty-five.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",6
"7","37036. Is there a village?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",7
"8","—No, they are scattered here and there, and are on the roadside, as close to the road as possible.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",8
"9","37037. Among the crofts?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",9
"10","—Separate from the crofts, on the public roadside, where they don't tramp on any grass.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",10
"11","37038. Do they pay any rent at all?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",11
"12","—Some of them do, but they refuse to take any rent from others.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",12
"13","37039. What is the meaning of that?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",13
"14","—I don't know; because the houses are not worth it, I suppose; that it would be a shame to take rent for them.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",14
"15","37040. But don't you think the people in the houses might think it a shame to offer it ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",15
"16","—They would be glad to offer it rather than be evicted.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",16
"17","37041. Do they wish these people to leave the place ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",17
"18","—Yes, if they would go away quietly.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",18
"19","37042. Are you able to speak about the crofters who are on that place ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",19
"20","—Well, I know the general run of them.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",20
"21","37043. Are they very comfortably off?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",21
"22","—Indeed they are hard pushed to pay the rent; the rents are very high.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",22
"23","37044. What is about the rent?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",23
"24","—They were telling me they average from £ 5 to £6 and £6, 10s. for each cow they keep on the croft.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",24
"25","37045. What is the rent of a croft now in Killean, off and on ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",25
"26","—Those  who have two cows and scant to keep them pay £ 10; there is one beside  me and he has just one cow, and he keeps that cow comfortably and pays  £7.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",26
"27","37046. And have they horses ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",27
"28","—No, none.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",28
"29","37047. Have they sheep ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",29
"30","—No sheep.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",30
"31","37048. How do they get the land ploughed?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",31
"32","—They employ one of the large farmers to plough it in the spring time.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",32
"33","37049. What stock do they keep",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",33
"34","—Highland cattle ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",34
"35","—Highland cattle generally, but some of them are sometimes not able to afford to have any kind of cattle.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",35
"36","37050. Does your neighbour who pays £7 work the whole year upon the croft ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",36
"37","—No; he is a smith, and works at his trade.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",37
"38","37051. What do the crofters do who don't work upon their crofts?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",38
"39","—They all work upon their crofts.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",39
"40","37052. But don't they work somewhere else besides ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",40
"41","—There  is no employment for them unless Mr M'Intyre, who keeps the lime  quarries going, employs them. That is the only means of living in this  island, quarrying.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",41
"42","37053. And do any of the crofters work there ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",42
"43","—Yes,  there is one just now beside me who pays £16 of rent, and who has two  cows, and I believe the place would keep three if he had them. But he  had no way of living this summer if it had not been for M'Intyre, who  has given employment to many persons in distress.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",43
"44","37054. The land is good in this place ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",44
"45","—Very good indeed.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",45
"46","37055. The potatoes are excellent ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",46
"47","—Excellent potatoes and all kinds of crops ; if the land is laboured it yields a good crop of whatsoever kind.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",47
"48","37056. Do they sell potatoes every year ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",48
"49","—Generally they do.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",49
"50","37057. Where do they send them to ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",50
"51","—They sell them to different persons who come round and buy them.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",51
"52","37058. Irish people ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",52
"53","—No, they buy them at home; the Irish never come over here. Oban people take them.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",53
"54","37059. Were the crops much spoiled by the storm last year ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",54
"55","—No.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",55
"56","37060. Were they so good as they had been in former years ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",56
"57","—No.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",57
"58","37061. In a very good year how many barrels of potatoes would a barrel of seed produce ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",58
"59","—From twelve to sixteen and eighteen, and, if the seed crop is good, they give twenty-five barrels.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",59
"60","37062. Of course twenty-five barrels is a very exceptional crop, but it sometimes reaches that ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",60
"61","—Since the new seed came here, the ' Champion ' has been yielding twenty-five barrels in a good year.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",61
"62","37063. I suppose that will be one of the reasons why the rent is so high, that the soil is so good ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",62
"63","—The  soil is good, but it is not left to the people who are inclined to work  it ; there are so many independent people who want the land just now  for grazing purposes that those inclined to work the land do not get the  chance of doing it. If you seek a piece of the land you work it and  make yourself comfortable you will be just left out. ",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",63
"64","37064. How do the cottars live ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",64
"65","—Some of them are boating, and some are shoemakers, and some carpenters, and some masons, and others at different work.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",65
"66","37065. And some of them quarrymen ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",66
"67","—Yes.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",67
"68","37066. Are many of them sailors ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",68
"69","—Yes, there are two or three.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",69
"70","37067. Do they trade about the coast or go to foreign ports?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",70
"71","—Well,  I was going to foreign ports in my young days, but then I settled down  and got married and stayed at home, and got a little smack, and am  supporting myself and family.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",71
"72","37068. And do you trade about here just as Mr M'Coll did ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",72
"73","—I work for Mr M'Intyre generally.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",73
"74","37069. About here ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",74
"75","—-To the Isle of Skye, and Coll and Tyree, and Morven and Arisaig and Moidart, and in all directions.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",75
"76","37070. Have you much steady work ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",76
"77","—Sometimes  we have no reason to complain, and at other times there is not much.  The county is now going so much under grass that there is not so much  demand for lime as there used to be.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",77
"78","37071. Have any of these cottars a garden about the house?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",78
"79","—No.  There are four houses on the estate, which were built by Mrs Cheyne for  those who were on the roll; but shortly after that she was advised to  take these houses, because they were thought too good for the paupers,  and let them to cottars, and she then got them let and put £4 of rent on  each house, and there is just a little short bit of ground, about the  breadth of the house, with a garden laid out in front. The rest of the  houses had no gardens at one time ; and now, those who were evicted at  the other end and got houses here, have become old people, and the  younger ones being away working throughout the country, the gardens went  down and the walls were destroyed, and never rebuilt, and still the  crofters claim these gardens, and the cottars cannot get them. I made an  arrangement with the under factor, and the Duke was for building me a  house, and I was to get £8 from the Duke. Well, I was giving that to the  factor to do the quarrying, and I was to build the house and do all the  rest of the work, and yet pay a rent of 32s. 6d.; and when I asked for a  garden he told me I would get a spot for a midden at the back of the  house, but no garden.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",79
"80","37072. Can the cottars have a cow?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",80
"81","—No; I have one on another farmer's ground.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",81
"82","37073. How much do you pay for grazing ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",82
"83","—I was told yesterday that he was paying £6 of rent foment every cow that he has, and that I would have to pay likewise.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",83
"84","37074. He feeds her well for you in winter, and gives you good grazing in summer ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",84
"85","—He feeds her, I suppose, as he does his own.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",85
"86","37075. And you are the only one of that number who has a cow ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",86
"87","—Yes, I believe so.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",87
"88","37076. But I suppose there is plenty of milk in the place to buy ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",88
"89","—No,  that is the great evil. The farmer has been in the place altogether for  these twenty years back, and the markets are so good that they are  feeding the calves and giving them all the milk, and there is none left  for the cottars.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",89
"90","37077. So that the calves get the milk that the children used to get?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",90
"91","—Yes, we used to get the milk liberally to buy ; if we do buy it now it is not worth carrying, just sour milk.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",91
"92","37078. There is plenty of land, is there not, if it were given to you ? ",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",92
"93","—Plenty.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",93
"94","37079. Are there many of these people so well off that they could take a very small croft if they got it ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",94
"95","—The  whole of them could. There are those who were evicted off the land.  They were not evicted because they had no means; tbey had the means, as  they have yet.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",95
"96","37080. And they wish to get back to their former places ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",96
"97","—Yes, they would be glad to take the land back at a reasonable valuation—twenty families of them.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",97
"98","37081. How many are employed in the quarry ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",98
"99","—Mr  M'Intyre keeps, generally, from twelve to sixteen, and more if he could  get them. He would get as many as he liked in spring time.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",99
"100","37082. They are all people of the place ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",100
"101","—Yes.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",101
"102","37083. They are quite well up in that kind of work now ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",102
"103","—Yes.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",103
"104","37084. The quarry has been open for a long time ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",104
"105","—Yes, this is the third generation that is working in it.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",105
"106","37085. Have you a school down in your place ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",106
"107","—We have.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",107
"108","37086. Do the children attend school well ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",108
"109","—Yes.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",109
"110","37087. Are they good scholars ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",110
"111","—They do generally attend the school.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",111
"112","37088. Do a large number of young people go south ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",112
"113","—They all go south ; there is nothing here to keep them.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",113
"114","37089. Do they succeed well in the south?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",114
"115","—Some of them do. Some of them prosper very well, and some don't.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",115
"116","37090. Is the school so good there that they are able by their education to do well in the south ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",116
"117","—No,  there were better scholars made in my time in that school than there  are now; because the rule is now that the children must stick in the  school until they get to standard six,' and then away they go. The  teacher allows them to remain in school after that, but she don't like  them to come after that. But all she is under an obligation for she  teaches them.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",117
"118","37091. It is a lady who teaches down your way?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",118
"119","—Yes, we had a very good teacher indeed ; but she has left us now.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",119
"120","37092. It was not a lady who taught in your time ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",120
"121","—It  was old Mr M'Gill, the parish schoolmaster; and supposing we were away  labouring or at farm service in the summer time and spring time, we  could all go to school in the winter, and he would be glad to receive  us.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",121
"122","37093. There were very big boys in the school in those days?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",122
"123","—Yes.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",123
"124","37094. And good scholars ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",124
"125","—More scholars than there are now.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",125
"126","37095. They don't come back now after having passed the sixth standard?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",126
"127","—No, because the teacher don't care for them over that age.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",127
"128","37096. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",128
"129","—Does the Duke of Argyll show any interest in the crofters and cottars about you?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",129
"130","—He  will just come once in the year, and he just comes ashore out of his  yacht, and goes into the machine and drives right along to the end of  the estate, and drives back, and gets on board the yacht, and then away  he goes. We never get the pleasure to say one word to him at all.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",130
"131","37097. It would appear then that Mr M'Intyre is the benefactor of the place ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",131
"132","—He is the person upon whom the whole island relies, especially the poor and working class.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",132
"133","37098. It might be well if he had some land of his own in Lismore ? A good deal of land ?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",133
"134","—It would be a gracious thing if the like of him had the land between them.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",134
"135","37099. You think if the like of Mr M’Intyre had the land the poor people would be better off?",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",135
"136","—They would be, for he would take an interest in the people, and wish to see them all employed and comfortable",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",136
"137","—[Mr  Buchanan]. The witness Cameron said the average produce of a barrel of  potatoes in Lismore was from 8 to 16 returns. The average, to people  well acquainted with cultivation as I have been, is 8 barrels.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",137
"138","Sometimes the return is 12, 14, and 15, but that is not the average. The average, I consider, would be 8 barrels.",614,"Hugh Cameron","Argyll, Lismore",138
