"2","4077. The Chairman.",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",2
"3","—You have a croft?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",3
"4","—I have a croft, but I do not live by the croft. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",4
"5","4078. Are you a fisherman ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",5
"6","—I am a sort of a tradesman. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",6
"7","4079. What is your trade ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",7
"8","—A tailor. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",8
"9","4080. How long have you been resident in Roshkill ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",9
"10","—Twenty-seven years. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",10
"11","4081. Do you gain your subsistence more by your croft or more by your trade as a tailor ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",11
"12","—It is the tailoring that is keeping me alive",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",12
"13","—the sort of a living that I have. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",13
"14","4082. Have you any statement to make on the part of the people of Roshkill ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",14
"15","—I have nothing to say about them, but that they are tradesmen like myself. They number only a merchant and a shoemaker. There is another man who has got a bit of ground. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",15
"16","4083. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",16
"17","—Are you a Kilmuir delegate ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",17
"18","—I have nothing to do with Kilmuir. We have a little village to ourselves, which belongs of right to Harlosh. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",18
"19","4084. As a dealer or tradesman, you will be able to tell us something about the way in which the people are dressed ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",19
"20","—I am able to tell about that. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",20
"21","4085. In former times were the people more substantially and better dressed than they now are ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",21
"22","—Yes, and clothed much warmer. They are now clothed in south country rags. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",22
"23","4086. Did they use more cloth made of their own wool in former times than is now the case ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",23
"24","—I have seen about thirty-five years ago, when I was a boy, the webs of cloth—twenty yards to twenty-seven—which had been manufactured by the women of the household. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",24
"25","4087. What is the reason there is less home-made cloth now than there was when you were young?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",25
"26","—The want of wool; and the want of the mother of the wool—the sheep—to us poor people. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",26
"27","4088. Is it because the people have less pasture for their sheep than they formerly had ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",27
"28","—Yes, what else ? ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",28
"29","4089. Do you find that the people are less able to pay you now for making their clothes than they formerly were ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",29
"30","—In the beginning of my days it was very much easier for them to pay than it is now. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",30
"31","4090. Do they bring fewer clothes to you to make now than they formerly did ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",31
"32","—It is very little that I am seeing now-a-days of Highland cloth at all. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",32
"33","4091. Have you more bad debts now than you formerly had?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",33
"34","—They are doing their utmost to pay me. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",34
"35","4902. But still, is it more difficult for them to pay than it formerly was ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",35
"36","—Very much more difficult. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",36
"37","4093. Has the fashion in favour of south country rags, as you call them, something to do with the diminished business of the country ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",37
"38","—Many of the people would have nothing to do with the south country rags if they could do otherwise. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",38
"39","4094. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",39
"40","—Do they buy their south country clothing ready made up, or do they bring the webs to you to make ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",40
"41","— They buy the cloth mostly, for they don't consider the south country clothes so well 0r so strongly made as in our country. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",41
"42","4095. Mr Cameron.",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",42
"43","—Do the crofters who have got sheep sell the wool, as a rule, or do they manufacture it into clothes?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",43
"44","—The people on my side of the country have no wool themselves. The people who have sheep stock, as we have heard to-day, may possibly get a share of the wool. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",44
"45","4096. But is their share of wool, whatever it is, sold to brokers in the south, or is it manufactured into cloth, as appears to have been the custom in old times?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",45
"46","—Some of them send wool to the south —perhaps one in a hundred—to be made up into cloth. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",46
"47","4097. And the rest?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",47
"48","—They have not it. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",48
"49","4098. But the rest of those who have it?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",49
"50","—I do not know anything beyond the M'Leod country. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",50
"51","4099. Sir Kenneth Maclcenzie.",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",51
"52","—Do you mean to say that when people have their sheep in common, and the wool is sold in one lump, they have not any wool for themselves ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",52
"53","—No, unless they buy as strangers would buy. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",53
"54","4100. Mr Cameron.",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",54
"55","—But you say you know nothing about any country outside of the M'Leod country?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",55
"56","—-1 know about outsiders from hearsay. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",56
"57","4101. Well, will you answer about the wool from hearsay ; whether it is still the custom for those who have sheep to make their wool into cloth, for to send it to the south ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",57
"58","—Their wool would do little for them with us. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",58
"59","4102. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",59
"60","—Do you think the people about here are generally poorer now than they were in your younger days ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",60
"61","—I am sure of that. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",61
"62","4103. Are your circumstances better or worse 1",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",62
"63","—Worse; I have a large family. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",63
"64","4104. Professor Mackinnon.",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",64
"65","—How many are there in Roshkill paying rent ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",65
"66","—Four. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",66
"67","4105. What rent do they pay?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",67
"68","—William Campbell pays the highest rent; I think it is about £3. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",68
"69","4106. And the others?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",69
"70","—Another is near that, and I myself pay 39s. of bare rent, and the dues come to 3s. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",70
"71","4107. What stock are you allowed to keep?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",71
"72","—One cow. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",72
"73","4108. Anything else?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",73
"74","—And a stirk, by buying some feeding. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",74
"75","4109. No sheep?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",75
"76","—No sheep. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",76
"77","4110. Are there no sheep in the township at aU?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",77
"78","—No, but the Harlosh people claim our place. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",78
"79","4111. And they have sheep?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",79
"80","—They have a few. One may have one or two, and others have none at aU. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",80
"81","4112. Can you buy wool in the country from the other tenants who have sheep ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",81
"82","—Yes, we buy wool for clothes and stockings. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",82
"83","4113. And why don't those people who have sheep make country clothes as they did long ago ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",83
"84","—-Where I was born, which was in Bracadale, there were comfortable crofters there. They were in comfortable ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",84
"85","circumstances. They had cattle and sheep and horses. They had a great stretch of hill pasture. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",85
"86","4114. But, even as things are, woidd it not be more profitable for the people of the place to buy wool in the place, and make clothes of it than to buy south country clothes ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",86
"87","—Not now, because the wool is so dear. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",87
"88","4115. Is that the reason why they don't buy it?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",88
"89","—Those who are able to buy are buying now for the manufacture of bed clothing. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",89
"90","4116. Don't you think it would also be profitable for them to buy it for day clothing ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",90
"91","—The way the prices of sheep go, it would come very dear to them. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",91
"92","4117. Mr Cameron.",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",92
"93","—Who told you the wool is dear?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",93
"94","—-My own experience. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",94
"95","4118. Professor Mackinnon.",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",95
"96","—Do you buy it for your own clothes ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",96
"97","—No. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",97
"98","4119. Would it not be better to buy it, and get it done in that way?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",98
"99","— A man has enough to do to attend to his family. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",99
"100","4120. Mr Cameron.",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",100
"101","—Do you ever remember wool cheaper than it is now?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",101
"102","—Yes. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",102
"103","4121. In what year?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",103
"104","—Forty years and more ago. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",104
"105","4122. Within the limit of forty years, have you ever known wool cheaper than it is now?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",105
"106","—No, not much since then; but I could get, at that time, a good fleece of which I could make two or three pairs of stockings for 2s. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",106
"107","4123. The Chairman.",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",107
"108","—Do you go round from house to house, and work in the different houses, or do the people bring the cloth to you always?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",108
"109","—I used, at first, to go from house to house, but I ceased doing it. I ceased that about seventeen years ago. I have, since then, gone very little among the houses. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",109
"110","4124. How do you think the little boys are clothed, compared with what they were when you were young ?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",110
"111","—In my young days the children would have beautiful shirts on them of white blanketing, and a little kilt and a jacket, and went barefooted. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",111
"112","4125. You don't make clothes for the girls, but you may be able to state whether the young girls are as well dressed as they used to be?",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",112
"113","—At that time the young girls were clothed equally well with the boys, but now they wear cotton rags, ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",113
"114","4126. Do you think that all the manufactures which are brought hero from the Lowlands are rags, or of a bad quality ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",114
"115","—Some of them are good enough. ",71,"John Mcdonald","Skye, Dunvegan",115
