"59","11076. Have you any idea what the rent is these two brothers pay between them ?",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",59
"60","—Perhaps they don't themselves know, as the lots were only cut out last harvest.",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",60
"61","11077. Was the factor willing to give land to enlarge the crofts to the whole of the people if they were able to take them?",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",61

"66","—Our land is so small that we cannot live upon it. If the land we had was sufficiently large, as our parents had it, and from which our parents took their food, it would be then worth while to work upon it, and we would also take our food upon it, and we would not be necessitated to labour out of the country.",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",66
"67","11080. But my question was, seeing you have the prospect of getting land, is it not worth while to go and labour in the south and gather money for the purpose ?",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",67

At home even at this time of the year, and after this time. ",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",70
"71","11082. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—Was the size of your lot changed this year?",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",71
"72","—My lot was made less this year. ",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",72
"73","11033. Do you know if your rent has been reduced, or to what extent it has been reduced ?",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",73

"75","11084. Did you not expect, when the size of your lots was changed, to be told the amount of change that would take place in the rent ?",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",75
"76","—I cannot tell. I believe that the rent will be less on account of the reduction.",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",76
"77","11085. You say your forefathers were accustomed to have plenty of food. I suppose you allude to the time before the potato disease came into the country ?",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",77
"78","—Yes, before the potato failure.",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",78
"79","11086. Even the same land would not produce the same crop at the present day?",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",79
"80","—Yes, it would yield as much crop.",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",80
"81","11087. Are you getting as good potato crops as you used to get in the old time ?",190,"Donald Mckinnon","South Uist, Lochboisdale",81
