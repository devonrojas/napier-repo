"1","DONALD M'LELLAN, Crofter, Garra-na-mony (about 52)—examined.",198,"Donald Mclellan","South Uist, Lochboisdale",1
"2","11674. The Chairman.—Have you been freely elected a delegate?",198,"Donald Mclellan","South Uist, Lochboisdale",2
"3","—Yes.",198,"Donald Mclellan","South Uist, Lochboisdale",3
"4","11675. You have a written statement to lay before the Commission?",198,"Donald Mclellan","South Uist, Lochboisdale",4
"5","—Yes.—[Reads.] 'Garra-na-mony, South Uist, May 28, 1883. My Lord and Gentlemen, in the first place, Garra-na-mony crofters try their best to work their land, but it is impossible for them to take their supply out",198,"Donald Mclellan","South Uist, Lochboisdale",5
"6","of it. Now the only thing we want is to get more land, if we could get ' it. We have seen Garra-na-mony with sixteen crofters, and it is now divided among twenty-six. Some of them possess about two acres just now, and taxes are rising higher every year. It is impossible for us to work the small piece of land we have got, because we have never got a road made through the town. The land was rented first when the kelp was as high as £ 3 , 10s. per ton. There is no kelp made in this country since several years—but little of it last year—and the rent is as high as it was before. The people here are keeping little of stock, but the most",198,"Donald Mclellan","South Uist, Lochboisdale",6
"7","1 of it belongs to Mr Donald Fergusson, merchant, who keeps food to the people since the famine came. There is plenty of land in the country that was cultivated and brought to use by crofters once. Now this land is settled on farmers. Likely this country was made for themselves, for the poor crofters were thrown to the worst part of the country. If we had plenty of land, as it is possible for you to give us, our stock would be our own. There is a person here, who goes as one of the three witnesses, says that his grandfather kept 600 sheep and 30 head of cattle. The farmer took this stock by catching them on the grass, and locked them up in a fold till the greatest part of them became his own stock. The father of the witness was put out of this place, and a place was given to him three miles distant from the first place. He was in this place for six years, and he was then thrown out of this place by the order of Colonel Gordon, to give room to the stock of the farmer who got the place, and other seven besides him. We then went away with boats to a place twelve miles from the first, where there were no people, no houses, but heavy heather; sleeping in shore dens, with frost and snow covering our beds for five days and five nights, until they made turf cottages. We then made better houses in summer; and six years after that my father and other thirteen families were thrown out of that, and a place was given to us in Eriskay, on the south side of the island, that was never cultivated. My father and his neighbour got eight acres between them—four acres each. It is no wonder that this country is so poor, for I took thirty-seven years between Ireland, England, and Scotland on the sea. It is a poor thing for me after all my troubles, and keeping myself clear and my land paid. My two sons are gone away, because they have no land to make their living upon; and just now, for to let you know that I and my father was selling food as long as we had plenty of land, and it is the want of land that is making the people so poor. Now I hope that you will give land to us, if you please, that we can make our living upon. Another of the witnesses says that he was put out of his land. The ground officer took spite to us because we did not kill the dog we had. I took three years' paying twenty-five shillings for every year for the house, because it was on the land of another person, until I got a small piece of land. Although this was cruel, it was more cruel when my brother was bound, and put out of this country without any fault, with a weak family. Some of the wituesses are here that saw this sight. You see that now before you, whether that was good or not. If they are going to keep up that law iu this country, this country will be very poor. The third witness says that he was put out of his land, without any fault, by the ground officer; and a place was given to me near the hill, with a weak family, to give place to another person, with about two acres of land and nothing else. I am in this condition yet since sixteen years ago; aud it was Mr Ferguson, farmer, Kilbride, who was giving me place, and the rest of the crofters in Garra-na-mony, for to make the potatoes. All my sons, as they grew, went away to make their living, and to help me as best they could, because they had no place to live upon. The most of the crofters in Garra-na-mony suffered nearly as much as we suffered. If they get plenty of laud, and lease upon it, we will pay great attention to it in draining the land, instead of being in danger every year iu throwing me out of my land without the least fault. —GARRA-NA-MONY CROFTERS.'",198,"Donald Mclellan","South Uist, Lochboisdale",7
