"14","â€”Yes, indeed. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",14
"15","4318. Have you any additional statement to make on your own part? Not much. In our townships we have no peat moss. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",15
"16","4319. Sheriff Nicolson.",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",16
"17","â€”Where do you get your peats?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",17

"21","4321. Is the peat moss far from you?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",21
"22","â€”Yes, but many of the people have not that privilege. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",22
"23","4322. How far is the peat moss from where you get your peats?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",23
"24","â€”It is a mile from the man who is farthest away from it. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",24
"25","4323. Have you horses?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",25
"26","â€”Yes. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",26
"27","4324. Has every crofter a horse?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",27
"28","â€”Yes; there is a horse allowed to every full croft. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",28
"29","4325. Do you use the horses for ploughing, or do you use the cas-chrom?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",29
"30","â€”Those who have land suitable for ploughing use the horses, and there are others who have not been able to use a horse at all in cultivating their land. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",30
"31","4326. Do you fish for cod and ling?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",31

"33","4327. Do you fish for herring regularly when they are to be got?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",33
"34","â€” Yes, a few families who have nets. There are many of them who have no nets. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",34
"35","4328. Were any of your boats destroyed in the great storm the year before last?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",35
"36","â€”Yes. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",36
"37","4329. Did you get new ones ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",37
"38","â€”Yes, every one of them. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",38
"39","4330. Much better than they had before?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",39
"40","â€”Yea. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",40
"41","4331. Has there been any positive destitution in Elgoll this season?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",41
"42","â€” I have not seen such destitution for the past forty years",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",42
"43","â€”such want of food. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",43
"44","4332. Do you refer to the great potato failure in 1846 ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",44
"45","â€”Yes. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",45
"46","4333. Have you got any relief from the committee1?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",46
"47","â€”Yes, many of us got that.",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",47
"48","4334. Were they satisfied with the way in which it was distributed ? ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",48
"49","â€”There were not many who went to ask relief, and who needed it, but got it; but there are many who are still needy, and who have not got it, but these did not, I think, ask for it ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",49
"50","4335. Mr Cameron.",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",50
"51","â€”Do you go to the Loch Hourn fishing?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",51
"52","â€”Yes; those who have nets go, but there are not many in our townships who have nets. They are not able to buy them. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",52
"53","4336. Do they make much profit out on the fishing at Loch Hourn ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",53
"54","â€” Yes. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",54
"55","4337. Would the people go more to the fishing in Loch Hourn if they had more nets ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",55
"56","â€”Yes. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",56
"57","4338. Have you any complaint to make in regard to the mode in which the fishing is conducted in Loch Hourn?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",57
"58","â€”The south country people are spoiling itâ€”fishing it in. daylight and trawling, and so spoiling it on the poor peopleâ€”trawling even on the Sabbath day. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",58
"59","4339. Have there been any cases of steamers from other places carrying away the fishermen's nets ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",59
"60","â€”I have not noticed anything of that. The steamers are very careful. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",60
"61","4340. You did not hear any cases of that kind last year?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",61
"62","â€”No, I did not hear; but another might have heard of it. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",62
"63","4341. What was the price of herring per cranlast year?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",63
"64","â€”From 2s. 6d. to 18s. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",64
"65","4342. It varied according to the supply ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",65
"66","â€”Yes, according to the means of getting it to market. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",66
"67","4343. Could you suggest any means which might be adopted so as to equalise the prices, and avoid getting such a small price as 2s. 6d. ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",67
"68","â€” Yes, if the poor people had an opportunity of salting them, they would get a better price for them, and steamers would have less to take with them in great hauls, and the poor people would then get a better price. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",68
"69","4344. What do you mean by having better opportunities of salting ? ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",69
"70","â€” If they had money wherewith to buy barrels and salt, they themselves could sell the herring when they had cured them. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",70
"71","4345. You don't cure the fish yourselves ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",71
"72","â€”No, we have no means of doing it. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",72
"73","4346. They are taken away by the steamers to cure?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",73
"74","â€”Yes; and if the steamers would not take them, perhaps a poor man would lose twelve crans and more, and then their nets along with them. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",74
"75","4347. Do they lose anything in consequence of the want of telegraphic communication ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",75
"76","â€”Yes, people would be the better of the telegraph. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",76
"77","4348. How would they use the telegraph ? For what purpose ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",77
"78","â€”We could know all about the state of the market, and when the fishing was in he loch. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",78
"79","4349. So as not to lose a good opportunity of salting your fish or selling them?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",79
"80","â€”Yes. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",80
"81","4350. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",81
"82","â€”The previous witnesses stated that they wanted more land, which had been possessed by their forefathers. If you got that land which you want would you pay a fair rent for it ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",82
"83","â€” Yes, and thankful to do that. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",83
"84","4351. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",84
"85","â€”What do you understand by a fair rent ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",85
"86","â€”If I would know how much land I was to getâ€”what summing I could keep on it. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",86
"87","4352. Do you think that the present tacksman pays a fair rent for his tack ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",87
"88","â€”We do not know what his rent is. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",88
"89","4353. And you cannot say whether the crofters of Elgoll would be Norman willing to pay the same rent as the tacksman does, if that land were given to them?-",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",89
"90","â€”No, as we don't know what the tacksman is paying. We would pay a fair rent if we would get the land. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",90
"91","4354. A former witness stated they turned over part of the ground twice in the year ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",91
"92","â€”If he lifts his potatoes early, he may be able to plant cabbage. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",92
"93","4355. He also stated that for three bolls of oats sown sometimes he only reaped one boll. Is that also your experience?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",93
"94","â€”Yes, that is my experience also. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",94
"95","4356. Would it be better rather not to cultivate that piece at all, and give it rest for a year ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",95
"96","â€”If it could be left out of cultivation two years, we could get a double crop out of it. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",96
"97","4357. How do the seventeen cottars live that are in Elgoll ? Do they pay rent to the crofters ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",97
"98","â€”No. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",98
"99","4358. How do they live at all?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",99
"100","â€”Going away to their earnings and getting help at home here and there,",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",100
"101","â€”getting a few bits of land from such of the crofters as can afford to give them it. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",101
"102","4359. And the crofters don't charge them any rent?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",102
"103","â€”No. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",103
"104","4360. Do they give them any assistance in work ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",104
"105","â€”No, not to speak of, as the crofters have no work to be done for them. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",105
"106","4361. I should like to hear what your idea of a fair comfortable croft would be ? What would be the summing of a reasonably-sized croft ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",106
"107","â€” Four or five cows, forty or fifty sheep, and a horse or two. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",107
"108","4362. And of arable land which would winter these black cattle and horses ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",108
"109","â€”Ten or eleven acres. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",109
"110","4363. Now, on the estate on which you are, what would you think a fair rent for that croft?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",110
"111","â€”I would say Â£8. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",111
"112","4364. Of course, you are not able to say whether it pays more just now? ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",112
"113","â€”No, as I do not know what the rent is. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",113
"114","4365. You would not think it would be worth more than that to a crofter ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",114
"115","â€”I do not know, but it might be worth more, according to the demand and the quality of the land. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",115
"116","4366. But you would be willing to give a reasonable rent for itâ€”such as any other man could afford to give ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",116
"117","â€”Yes, according to what valuation could be made for it. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",117
"118","4367. Are there any sheep in Elgoll just now?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",118
"119","â€”I don't believe there are more than two for each lot. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",119
"120","4368. You say the people are very poor. Do you think there are many among them who could take such a croft if they got it ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",120
"121","â€”Yes, plenty. They are spending in meal in the half-year as much as would pay for such a croft. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",121
"122","4369. How long have you been paying rent in Elgoll yourself ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",122
"123","â€”I am forty-seven years paying rent. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",123
"124","4370. How many people were in Elgoll paying rent in that old time when your father began to pay rent?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",124
"125","â€”I cannot remember exactly, but I will guess about sixteen or seventeen. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",125
"126","4371. And there are now forty-five ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",126
"127","â€”Yes. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",127
"128","4372. And the increase has taken place, partly at least, by other people being thrown in upon them?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",128
"129","â€”Yes, they were taken from Keppoch. Those of the Keppoch people who would not go to Australia were settled down among us. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",129
"130","4373. How many sheep did your father keep on his croft ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",130
"131","â€”He had fifty sheep, at least. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",131
"132","4374. Do you remember his rent at that time ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",132
"133","â€”That was before they lost the hill. He was paying Â£3, 10s. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",133
"134","4375. Of course, your memory can go back long before the potato-disease 1",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",134
"135","â€”Yes. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",135
"136","4376. Were the people very much better fed at that time than they are now?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",136
"137","â€”Yes, they had plenty of food then. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",137
"138","4377. What kind of food had they?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",138
"139","â€”They were making food from what they grew themselvesâ€”making meal of their own oats, and using their potatoes. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",139
"140","4378. I suppose you have quite a distinct recollection of the years from 1846 to 1851â€”the year of the potato disease, and the two or three years following?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",140
"141","â€”Yes, I was working in the south in the year of the potato failure. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",141
"142","4379. But you were at home the two or three years following?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",142
"143","â€”Yes. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",143
"144","4380. And do you say distinctly that the people are worse off this year and poorer than they were in those years ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",144
"145","â€”I don't remember the people being as poor as they are this year, the most of them. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",145
"146","4381. Of course, there are a large number of the families in Elgoll that could not take crofts, even if they got them, from their poverty ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",146
"147","â€”Those who could not take such large crofts as that could take smaller. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",147
"148","4382. I suppose they could not stock them without assistance",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",148
"149","â€”the whole of them ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",149
"150","â€”No. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",150
"151","4383. But you think there is plenty of land in the country for the whole of them, if they got it ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",151
"152","â€”Yes. The land that my grandfather had is in green rigs, marching with us, on the other side of our fence. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",152
"153","4384. When the people of the place were talking over this matter among themselves, had they any other remedy to improve their condition besides getting larger holdings in their own place ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",153
"154","â€”There is no other remedy that they talk of. ",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",154
"155","4385. And you think that remedy quite sufficient ?",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",155
"156","â€”Yes, we think so; and then we will not require any outside assistance. If we could only get land we could work.",77,"Norman Robertson ","Skye, Broadford",156
