"176","—Yes.",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",176
"177","34805. What is the summing upon the two crofts?",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",177
"178","—Six cows, two horses, and twelve sheep.",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",178

"182","—Yes.",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",182
"183","34808. Do you remember Ardtun before you came to live in it ?",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",183
"184","—It has always been under crop.",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",184
"185","34809. But you like the place quite well, except that you consider the rent too high ?",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",185
"186","—I like the place well enough and the neighbours, only I consider the rent too high.",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",186
"187","34810. What rent would you consider reasonable for those crofts for which you are paying £18, 15s. ?",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",187
"188","—I think if the rent was about £13 it would give me room to live.",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",188
"189","34811.  You quite agree, after considering the price of stock and labour, and  the general improvement in the condition of the place all over, that the  croft is worth now somewhat more than it was when you went to Ardtun  first ?",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",189
"190","—Some of the crofts are better than others; and those I  have, if they were drained and reclaimed, would be worth fully more than  when I went.",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",190
"191","34812. Your neighbour said he did not  want a lease because the rent was too high. If you got your crofts at a  reasonable rent would you like a lease ?",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",191

"194","—Yes, if the rent was reasonable. ",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",194
"195","34814. But you would not wish to take a lease at the present high rent ?",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",195

"198","—I  spoke to the chamberlain about a reduction, and he said he could not do  anything in the meantime; he would speak for me, and I think he will do  it.",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",198
"199","34816. Are there many in the place, in Ardtun, without land at all ?",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",199
"200","—Yes, a good many.",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",200
"201","34817. What was their condition this last winter ?",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",201
"202","—Some were complaining, and some bad enough. They were tiding over as best they could. ",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",202
"203","34818. They were in very much poorer circumstances than those who had land ?",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",203
"204","—I cannot say that their state was worse than those who had the land.",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",204

"206","— No.",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",206

"208","—No, neither of us were; we were helping our parents.",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",208
"209","34821. I suppose there is as much land, arable and grazing, attached to the village of Ardtun as when you went there ?",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",209
"210","—I am not aware that any person lost an inch.",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",210
"211","34822. Your only complaint is that your rent is so high?",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",211
"212","—Our  only complaint is that the rent is too high, and if we get it down we  will be all comfortable. I have a small matter to bring before the  Commission which was entrusted to me by a neighbour. When I came to the  crofts I now have they were in the hands of the factor, and the grass  that was then in the crofts the neighbours got it to put their cows in.  For this privilege some paid 10s., some more, and one paid 30s. That got  into the Duke's books, and remained so until this time. The rent was  raised a short time after that, and I was of opinion that they are  confounding what they were paying for the privilege of grazing upon this  croft with the rise which was made upon the rent. I am only speaking as  I was informed; I cannot say myself; I was not in the country at the  time.",577,"Duncan Mclean, Lachlan Macdonald","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",212
