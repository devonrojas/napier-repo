"2","10124. The Chairman.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",2
"3","—Have you any statement to make ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",3
"4","—No. ",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",4
"5","10125. Did you come here by invitation of the Commissioners?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",5
"6","—Yes.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",6
"7","10126. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",7
"8","—Are you a native of Kilmuir?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",8
"9","—Yes.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",9
"10","10127. Have you lived all your life in Kilmuir ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",10
"11","—Yes.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",11
"12","10128. Do you see much difference in the condition of the people since you were a young man ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",12
"13","—No.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",13
"14","10129. What part of the parish were you born in ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",14
"15","—Kilmaluag.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",15
"16","10130. And you have now gone to take up your residence next door to Kilmaluag again ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",16
"17","—Yes.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",17
"18","10131. Do you think the Kilmaluag people are in as good circumstances as they were when you first remember ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",18
"19","—Fully.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",19
"20","10132. Do you think the land returns as much crop as it used to do ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",20
"21","—I think not; but I think there is more money in the place than there was when I was young.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",21
"22","10133. You have occasion to know that?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",22
"23","—Yes.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",23
"24","10134. Do you deal in meal at all?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",24
"25","—Not just now.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",25
"26","10135. What reason have you for thinking there is more money in the place than there used to be ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",26
"27","—They are getting better prices for stock.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",27
"28","10136. But, on the other hand, they must spend more money than they used to do ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",28
"29","—Yes, in dress, and so on.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",29
"30","10137. Then, though they get more money, if they spend more money, perhaps there is not more money left in the place after all ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",30
"31","—As to that I cannot say.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",31
"32","10138. You cannot say whether they are more in debt to the meal merchant than they were ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",32
"33","—I don't think they are.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",33
"34","10139. We were told that the people were in debt for meal to the extent of £700. Do you think that is a true statement ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",34
"35","—I don't think it is true at all.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",35
"36","10140. Sheriff Nicolson.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",36
"37","—Something  like that was also told us about Glenhinisdale. They were said to be in  debt £600, chiefly for meal. Do you think that is an exaggeration ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",37
"38","—I think so.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",38
"39","10141. I suppose you heard most of what was said at Uig and Stenscholl?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",39
"40","—No.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",40
"41","10142. Did you see it in the newspapers?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",41
"42","—A little of it.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",42
"43","10143. Was there anything which you thought decidedly incorrect?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",43
"44","—About that debt, I think it was not right.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",44
"45","10144. Do you think the rents are too high ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",45
"46","—Well, when they get better prices for the stock, I think the rise in rent is nothing in comparison with the rise in prices.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",46
"47","10145. I suppose your own rents have been raised a good deal also?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",47
"48","—No; of course there were additions.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",48
"49","10146. We were told about grass that was taken from the people to be added to your farm?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",49
"50","—I never removed a tenant since I was born. ",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",50
"51","10147. But did Captain Fraser did?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",51
"52","—He gave them as good places as they had in compensation for that.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",52
"53","10148. But since you got Monkstadt a good many of them were shifted to other places ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",53
"54","—No, not in Kilmuir.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",54
"55","10149. But I suppose you remember that a good many were removed?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",55
"56","—Yes ; but they got as good places as they had in payment for that.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",56
"57","10150. They say themselves that the places are not so good?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",57
"58","—I think they are.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",58
"59","10151. Do you think the amount of their pasture is the same as it was?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",59
"60","—I think so. They went to the two best places I knew of on the estate—Kilmaluag and Balmaquien.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",60
"61","10152. Were there no crofters on these two places before ?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",61
"62","—Yes, in Kilmaluag; but some of them went of their own accord to America about that time.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",62
"63","10153. Were there crofters at Balmaquien before?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",63
"64","—Yes.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",64
"65","10154. Was it new crofts or old ones that these crofters got?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",65
"66","—Old ones.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",66
"67","10155. Professor Mackinnon.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",67
"68","—Do you remember the last forty years back?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",68
"69","—Not exactly.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",69
"70","10156.  We have been told there were a large number of people removed and a  considerable number of crofting townships cleared in Kilmuir during that  time. I suppose there are a considerable number of townships that were  peopled then which are not peopled now?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",70
"71","—That was forty-three years ago. It was in Sulister and Erisker.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",71
"72","10157. You don't remember a single township of crofters cleared on Kilmuir at all?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",72
"73","—No, except Graulin.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",73
"74","10158. Do you remember hill pasture being taken from townships that are not cleared yet?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",74
"75","—Yes.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",75
"76","10159. So that the amount of land occupied by crofters now in Kilmuir is very much less than it was when you first remember?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",76
"77","—No, except a wee bit hilly ground.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",77
"78","10160. It is less by the two cleared townships and the amount of hill pasture that was taken away?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",78
"79","—They got the offer of a hill, I am told, but they would not pay the rent.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",79
"80","10161. Has the population of Kilmuir increased or diminished within that time?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",80
"81","—I am not sure. I think it is fully as large as it was.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",81
"82","10162. Sheriff Nicolson.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",82
"83","—Did you ever advise Major Fraser to raise or to lower the rents?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",83
"84","—Never.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",84
"85","10163. Did you not advise him to lower them?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",85
"86","—No, I had no business to speak to the major about a matter of that sort.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",86
"87","10164. Did he not sometimes get advice from you?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",87
"88","—No.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",88
"89","10165.  I have been told that he himself said you had advised him to lower the  rents : perhaps you forget it. I suppose you can truly say that you  never gave him any bad advice?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",89
"90","—I believe he would not take it well if I would do so.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",90
"91","10166. Did you ever give him any advice against the people?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",91
"92","—Never.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",92
"93","10167. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",93
"94","—Have you been all your days in Skye? ",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",94
"95","—Yes, I may say so.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",95
"96","10168. What rent was your father paying for his place in Kilmaluig?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",96
"97","— I cannot say, but the first rent I paid was £34. ",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",97
"98","10169. What have you been paying of late for Monkstadt?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",98
"99","—About £1005.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",99
"100","10170. You are not in arrears?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",100
"101","—Not a penny, except what is due since Martinmas last.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",101
"102","10171. Then you are one of the few men in Skye whose circumstances are better now than they were forty years ago?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",102
"103","—I know small tenants who pay only £12, and who have £800 lying in the bank in Portree.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",103
"104","10172. Do you find sheep-farming now as profitable as it has been in past years?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",104
"105","— Yes, except the wool.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",105
"106","10173. Then you do not quite agree with your neighbour Duntulm, who said he was going back a good deal upon sheep?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",106
"107","—Well, cattle would pay fully as well as sheep—good Highland cattle.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",107
"108","10174. Have you a good number of cattle yourself?",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",108
"109","—I  have over three hundred head of black cattle. I wish to state in regard  to Donald Nicolson, that when he got the place he evicted a poor man  named M'Innes, who had a delicate consumptive son. This young man was  sent off to a barn, and he lived only three days. Then Nicolson allowed  his horse to stray with my milk cows. He came and offered me 7s. 6d. He  left his horse six weeks there with the milk cows, and when he came and  took it away he never gave me a penny.",174,"John Mcleod","Skye, Portree",109
