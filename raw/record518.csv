"1","RODERICK MACLEAN, Factor to Sir Alexander Matheson of Lochalsh, residing at Ardross, Alness —examined.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",1
"2","30948. The Chairman.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",2
"3","—Do you desire to make any general statement ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",3
"4","—I do. The system of division of Highland property which Sir Alexander Matheson advocates, and which he acts upon as opportunities occur, is to have crofts of £ 4 rent occupied by tradesmen, labourers, and fishermen, who would consider these holdings merely as homes for their families, and by outside labour paying rent and family requirements beyond the produce of their crofts. He would have no crofts at rents between £4 and £10, but from £ 1 0 to £15 for occupants who might occasionally hire themselves for labour when available, crofts from £15 to £ 30 self-supporting their occupants, middle-sized farms from £30 to £100, and large farms from £100 to £300 or £400 occupied by resident  tenants, but not to exceed the latter, circumstances permitting. The following is a classification of the rents on Sir Alexander's west coast estates:—",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",4
"5","154 crofts under £4",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",5
"6","72 -  from £4 to £6",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",6
"7","38 – from £6 to £10",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",7
"8","43 – from £10 to £20",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",8
"9","24 – from £20 to £30„ .",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",9
"10","9 farms from £30 to £100",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",10
"11","10 – from £100 to £200",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",11
"12","7 – from £200 to £325",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",12
"13","1 - at £600",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",13
"14","1 - at £900",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",14
"15","Sir Alexander came into possession of his property in the parish of Glenshiel in 1840, of Inverinate in Kintail in 1844, of the parish of Lochalsh and the estate of Eilandonan in Kintail in 1851, of his property in the parish of Contin in 1856  and in the parish of Lochcarron in 1861 and 1867. Since he became proprietor in Ross-shire he expended upon his estates all the income derived from them annually (including his east coast estates), amounting now to £23,000, and which has on several occasions been supplemented from other sources, thus affording employment to all of his people who were able and willing to work. Of the above outlays £86,867 were expended for the benefit of the tenants in buildings, draining, reclaiming land, fences, and roads. From 1870 till 1882 he wrote off £1326, 17s. 3d. of arrears. In 1880 he reduced the rents by £480, and since then made a further reduction of £290.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",15
"16","30949. Are there any remarks you wish to make upon particular statements?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",16
"17","—Yes, I would like to make some remarks. The first delegates that came before you were, I think, those from Avernish. In regard to them, I have to say that the people left Avernish in Mr Livingstone's time, and the reason was that they would not submit to his regulations for cultivating the farm by spade labour. They preferred to go abroad rather than submit to the rules he put forward, of which we have a copy. The lands were in the proprietor's hands under sheep when Sir Alexander bought the property. He let them to Mr Brown, Kilellan, who still keeps them under lease at a rent of £ 60. With regard to the improvements upon Avernish, made by the proprietor without charging interest, one house was built by him last year, and timber and lime were given to another, the brother of one of the delegates. The land was enclosed with a wire fence for the benefit of the tenants two years ago, at a cost of about £80. With regard to Kinnamoine, I was sorry to hear Mr Sinclair, who was spokesman for them, and who knows the internal management of the property, state that it was only a few weeks ago, when it was known the the Royal Commissioners were to come, that the fence was thought of. The erection of the fence was under consideration for three years, and it was at the urgent request of the Ardelve crofters that it was erected. But owing to the large amount of money always spent upon the estate we thought it better, instead of trenching upon Sir Alexander Matheson's other resources, to wait until the proceeds of the property would enable us to erect the fence. Besides that £ 110 have been expended upon the tenants' lands in improvements. At Alt-na-stu there are twelve tenants. There was £ 31 , 9s. 4d. of arrears when Sir Alexander Matheson came to the property, the rent being £44, 9s. 4d. He reduced the rent to £40, 2s. 6d. a few months ago. He gave them, in addition to their rent taken off, the grazings of Sallachy to endeavour to assist them, and there has been no rent charged for that yet. He would give them more land if he could. They spoke about getting land from Conchra, but you will see that the boundaries of the farm are such that it would spoil the amenity of the estate if that were done. With regard to Duirnish, in 1851, the rent was £ 114 or £ 115 ; it is now £ 108. There was £ 8 put upon Portnanaon, but no rent taken of. £10 8 and £ 8 make £116, so that there has been £1 of a rise since 1851; while £ 164 , 18s . were spent on improvements previous to October last, and about £ 2 0 during the current year. In Port-a-chullin there are eight tenants. They got an addition of land in 1878, and the rent, which at the time of the purchase of the property amounted to £36, 8s. 10d., besides an addition to the land, has been reduced to £32. One man built a new house, and the proprietor gave him timber and lime. They got as much land as they could without destroying the amenity of the surrounding farms. A wire fence has been erected to protect them from the sheep of the neighbouring farm, and a good piece of hill grazing has been added which they had not before. I think that is all I have to say with regard to what was stated by the witnesses. There was mention made about deer forests; and with regard to that I should say that  in 1878 Mr Brown, Kilellan, declined to",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",17
"18","renew his lease of the upper portion of his grazing, a place called Pait and Mealvoy.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",18
"19","30950. About 15,000 acres?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",19
"20","—Yes, about that, extending from the bridle-path crossing Mealvoy to Loch Monar. It was then let to Lord Lovat as a deer forest. I n 1881 Messrs Weir and Kellie were, at their urgent request, relieved of the farm of Nonach, Ben-Droneg, &c, and as no grazing tenant could be got at the time to take the farm, Sir Alexander made a forest of the upper portion, allowing Weir and Kellie a year rent free to clear the ground. He has added the low portion of this farm to the grazing of the seventeen neighbouring erofters of Salachy.'",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",20
"21","30951. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",21
"22","—What is the extent of this last forest?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",22
"23","—12,606 acres. In 1881, MrMaclennan, Lienassie, voluntarily gave up the higher portion of his farm, retaining the lower portion. Sir Alexander had no other means of disposing of the portion given up than adding it to the neighbouring forest.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",23
"24","30952. What is the extent of the last?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",24
"25","—7150 acres.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",25
"26","30953. The Chairman.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",26
"27","—What does it make altogether ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",27
"28","—34,000 acres. As is seen by the accompanying map, the ground forested is lying far inland from the inhabited portions of the property. There are within the bounds only about ten acres of arable land, which had been occupied by shepherds as potato plots. The hills are high, six of them ranging from 2900 feet to 3771 feet, and the average elevation is over 2400 feet. The increase of rental derived from these forests has lightened the parochial burdens on Sir Alexander's property by about 25 per cent.'",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",28
"29","30954. Do we correctly understand now that it is the practice, and has been the practice of Sir Alexander Matheson, to spend the whole net rental on these Highland estates on this property ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",29
"30","—It has been his practice since he became proprietor to spend every penny derived both from the east and west coast estates somewhere on the estates, and that largely supplemented from other resources.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",30
"31","30955. Putting aside the expenditure upon his dwelling-house and plantations and gardens, and all that contributes to the amenity of the place, could you give us any idea,of the gross expenditure on the whole estate during his time ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",31
"32","—On the whole of the west coast estates £205,000, and of that there was for improvements for tenants' benefit, £86,867; mansion-house, pleasure grounds. &c, £74,367, 17s. 3d. ; shooting lodges, £6718, 15s. Id.; hotels, £10,733, Is. 3d.; roads, £11,300, 18s. 7d.; plantations, £14,097, 12s. Id.; Commercial Bank office, £806, 8s. 9d.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",32
"33","30956. Can you give us any general impression of what proportion of the £86,867 has been expended upon holdings of above £ 30 a year of value, and how much upon the smaller class of occupiers below £30 ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",33
"34","—£5397 have been expended on tenants under £30, say £5400 upon the",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",34
"35","crofters and small tenants.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",35
"36","30957. In regard to the large expenditure upon the mansion-house and plantations of the proprietor, was local labour extensively employed on these works ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",36
"37","—Yes, all the labour in forming the plantations was local labour.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",37
"38","30958. And was the unskilled labour connected with the house and grounds also local ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",38
"39","—I am not very sure. There must have been some natives employed; but I was not present at the erection of the houses. At the garden and other works local labour was employed.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",39
"40","30959. How many thousand acres have been planted ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",40
"41","—I am not able to tell you.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",41
"42","30960. In round numbers?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",42
"43","—There are about 2500 acres underwood at the present moment.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",43
"44","30961. Including all the plantations ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",44
"45","—Yes. The plantations were all, with a very few exceptions, made by Sir Alexander Matheson.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",45
"46","30962. Was the land now occupied by wood taken for the most part off sheep farms, or was there any land of the small tenants absorbed ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",46
"47","—There was some rocky ground along the shores of Loch Long taken off one of the holdings in the parish of Kintail, and I believe it has been a benefit to the people to take the land from them, and prevent their sheep from falling off the rocks.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",47
"48","30963. In the case of small portions of hill pasture being taken from the occupant of a farm, has some compensation or consideration in rental or otherwise always been made to the people ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",48
"49","—No land has been taken from any of the crofters except this portion I mentioned at Camusluinie.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",49
"50","30964. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",50
"51","—None from Plockton ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",51
"52","—I am speaking of the property in this direction; Kintail is in the proprietor's hands. The land in Glenshiel is now used as grazing; at Camuslunie I cannot say what the arrangements are.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",52
"53","30965. The Chairman.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",53
"54","—There was one small piece of twenty acres alleged to have been taken off the crofters ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",54
"55","—I am coming to that. At Monach there was a large piece taken off a large farm, about fifty acres. At Avernish there was a reduction made on the rent when the land was taken. At Duirnish there were twenty acres of rocky land, worth from fourpence to sixpence an acre, taken. I am not aware of any compensation being given for that.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",55
"56","30966. Would the land where the wood grows be of any use to crofters in the way of shelter ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",56
"57","—Of great use.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",57
"58","30967. Why was the plantation made ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",58
"59","—To occupy the place, and with the view of getting some benefit from the ground where none was got before, and also with the ultimate view of affording shelter for the cattle of the crofters. Without the wood there can be no shelter.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",59
"60","30968. With reference to the strip of land which was enclosed by a fence along the river side, what was the reason that the fence was put on the crofters' side and not on the other ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",60
"61","—To get a walk along the burn as part of the pleasure grounds. To get a walk inside the fence, and a belting of wood between the walk and the fence.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",61
"62","30969. The intention was to plant the margin of the stream ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",62
"63","—It was planted last year.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",63
"64","30970. Was any little allowance made to the crofters for that land being taken away ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",64
"65","—Not yet.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",65
"66","30971. Do you think they are prejudiced at all in their interests by the land being taken ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",66
"67","—I don't think so ; but I think the reason of the statement made by the witnesses is, that they are continually quarrelling among themselves—they cannot agree among themselves. They are now coming to an agreement on account of regulations made about two months ago.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",67
"68","30972. Will the trees when they grow up be of any use to the crofters holdings as shelter, or will they be merely ornamental ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",68
"69","—They will be of use for shelter.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",69
"70","30973. Would you generally state that it is the principle of your estate management, and your proprietor's desire, when any small portions of land for general purposes are taken from the crofters, to offer them indemnity or some compensating benefit ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",70
"71","—In general they always get that.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",71
"72","30974. There was a statement made that in one township the people had been deprived of the natural sea-ware of their own shore, and that it had been granted to an adjacent place; was that done ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",72
"73","—I may say shortly, that in the management of the west coast estates I am not well up in these details, but Mr Watson will be able to explain that.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",73
"74","30975. We are to understand in general that since Sir Alexander Matheson's proprietorship of the estate there has been no consolidation of small holdings in the form of a large sheep farm ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",74
"75","—No such thing at all.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",75
"76","30976. And has there been any case of the addition of crofters' ground to deer forest ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",76
"77","—No; no such thing at all.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",77
"78","30977. One delegate said that a portion of the hill pasture of the township had been taken and been put on to a deer forest ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",78
"79","—He goes back to the time of Mr Lilliugstone and Sir Hugh Innes. ",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",79
"80","30978. You have stated the different categories of holdings into which Sir Alexander Matheson desires to divide his estate in an ascending scale toffarms of a maximum rental of from £300 to £400. He has not yet been able to arrive at his ideal; there are exceptional farms still ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",80
"81","—Yes; and these cannot, -without a great deal of expense, be reduced; and indeed they ought not to be reduced, on account of their natural position. On one of them there is a farm-house, and the land extends in a narrow strip about ten or twelve miles inland. It would be too narrow to make two farms at the one end, and it would be exceedingly expensive to make a road to the upper end and to build a steading.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",81
"82","30979. Is there any portion of ground on that farm or others which in your mind might be granted for the purpose of making an addition to the crofters' common grazing ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",82
"83","—I don't think there is.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",83
"84","30980. You don't think there is a single case on the whole estate by which the crofters could be benefited by the addition of ground ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",84
"85","—No. The estate is quite compact, and it is impossible to do that without disorganising the system of management.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",85
"86","30981. We heard of a small farm held by an absentee tenant which the crofters said could be added ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",86
"87","—That is Avernish, and the tenant is resident; but it is an outlying place which, Sir Alexander having had in his own hands, the crofters were not able to take, and he let it to Mr Brown. That could be reduced to make four crofts of £15 each.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",87
"88","30982. Could it not be given to a township in the form of common grazing ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",88
"89","—It would not do.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",89
"90","30983. Why ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",90
"91","—Because it would be destroying the system Sir Alexander has in view of making crofters self-supporting from £15 to £30 of rent: and by giving it to townships they could not be able to stock it. It would be rather too expensive for them to put up steadings, and Sir Alexander's view is to have three or four crofters, if such could be arranged, and he would not wish to go outside his own people to get them.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",91
"92","30984. Are we to understand from you that you don't think on the whole estate, in any part of it, there is any prospect of Sir Alexander being able to restore or grant any larger amount of common pasture to any crofters?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",92
"93","—No, there is not.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",93
"94","30985. In fact, the system is closed ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",94
"95","—It is closed.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",95
"96","30986. With reference to the deer forests which have been formed recently by the cession of sheep farms, is any portion of these deer forests handy for crofters in the form of common pasture ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",96
"97","—No. The furthest off end is eighteen miles from here.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",97
"98","30987. Are these deer forests all under tenancy, or does Sir Alexander retain one in his own hands'?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",98
"99","—Lord Lovat has a portion taken from Kilellan, Major Crosswell has a portion of Lochalsh, and Mr Winans has the part which Mr Maclennan gave up.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",99
"100","30988. What is the system on which the improvement of houses is conducted ? Are there any estate regulations with reference to the improvement of houses ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",100
"101","—The proprietor offers timber and lime to any of the poor people who will build houses for themselves, but in general he is allowed to do the whole of it.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",101
"102","30989. Can you give me any idea how many new or improved houses are erected in the course of the year, or in any period ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",102
"103","—I cannot tell. I know that at one place which will come before you to-morrow, —Camusulinie—he offered slates, timber, and lime to every one of the tenants who would build houses. Two have taken advantage of that offer and Sir Alexander gave them £20 in money along with the timber and lime and slates.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",103
"104","30990. What is the cost of building an improved crofter's house on a croft of say £ 4 or £ 5 rent ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",104
"105","—It is difficult to answer that question, because, whatever way it happens, what we get for £100 in the low country costs £150 here. We cannot get labour done cheaply here.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",105
"106","30991. But I suppose the people are contented with less : they don't expect such good houses as they would get in the low country ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",106
"107","—They would like to have them if they could get them without costing themselves much.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",107
"108","30992. Tbey do appreciate an improved dwelling ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",108
"109","—Yes, when they get it for nothing.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",109
"110","30993. Are they not inclined to spend something themselves in the way of building as well as of carrying stones and that sort of thing ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",110
"111","—Not very much.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",111
"112","30994. You find it is necessary that the proprietor should undertake almost all the outlay ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",112
"113","—Almost; that is what has been done hitherto. But I believe the tenants now are beginning to see that it is necessary for themselves to do something, and the proprietor encourages them to make themselves self supporting. In previous years they have been depending very much on the proprietor.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",113
"114","30995. Do you know any example of houses built by co-operation between the tenant and proprietor ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",114
"115","—Yes; those two I have made allusion to at Camusluinie.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",115
"116","30996. What share of the expense has the tenant borne, and what has fallen to the proprietor ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",116
"117","—The tenant would expend about £20 in money and about the same in the value of his labour, and the proprietor contributed about £100.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",117
"118","30997. In the case of a house of that sort, is there any understanding, in the case of the death or departure of a tenant, under which his expenditure or unexhausted improvements would be  reimbursed to himself or his heirs ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",118
"119","—That question has never been raised, because they know that Sir Alexander is not in the habit of ejecting any one.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",119
"120","30998. But they might be ejected by death?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",120
"121","—There is no written understanding.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",121
"122","30999. The case has never arisen ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",122
"123","—No; there is mutual confidence. The people are confident the proprietor will never do any harsh thing to them.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",123
"124","31000. I have the same confidence, but I would like to know what your idea is. Suppose a man had expended £40 on building a house upon Sir Alexander Matheson's property, and that his sons were abroad and did not take up the place, and that it was let to another; would there be any compensation for the £40, and, if there was, would it be paid by the landlord or by the in-coming tenant?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",124
"125","—The question has never been raised, but I am certain no injustice would be done the heirs of the person who died.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",125
"126","31001. Has there been any case of eviction on this property since Sir Alexander acquired it ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",126
"127","—Not one.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",127
"128","31002. Not even in the case of non-payment of rent?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",128
"129","—No, when the case becomes extreme, Sir Alexander Matheson writes off the arrears.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",129
"130","31003. Mr Cameron.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",130
"131","—With regard-to the farm which the people of Avernish wanted to get which was valued at £60, the delegate stated that he thought the people would be able to stock the farm with their own resources. Is that your belief?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",131
"132","—I don't think they could, because the stock would cost a good deal of money. It is possible they have more money than I am aware of, and if so the better for themselves. ",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",132
"133","31004. But you have never had an application from them for the farm, and you never made them an offer of it?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",133
"134","—No. ",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",134
"135","31005. So that you have not considered the question?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",135
"136","—No; I don't think they could stock it from their own means, but they might get help.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",136
"137","31006. Would some of them be able to stock it?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",137
"138","—It is possible; but I don't know.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",138
"139","31007. Can you explain exactly about the difference between the summing and the stock which they actually keep ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",139
"140","—According to the return which was furnished to the Commissioners, instead of one cow there were",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",140
"141","three cows kept, and the delegate said they took these on for wintering. The summing is, we will suppose, constantly upon the farm, then they have an idea of making a little profit by buying a young beast, and keeping it all the winter through. Possibly it may be a loss to them, but in general it is a profit, because they get the manure to manure the soil.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",141
"142","31008. Then was a return which you furnished to the Commissioners taken from the stock in possession of the crofters at the end of winter, or was it what they had during summer and winter?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",142
"143","—On the 1st of January.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",143
"144","31009. You took what you found on the 1st of January?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",144
"145","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",145
"146","31010. With regard to the case of the Kirkton tenants, was there any misunderstanding about the lease?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",146
"147","—The delegate said that to the best of his belief no lease was offered to the tenants, and that none existed. They had leases of ten or twelve years, but they expired in 1872, and they have had no leases since then.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",147
"148","31011. What was the arrangement made when the leases came to an end ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",148
"149","—There was no arrangement made.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",149
"150","31012. They went on at the same rent?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",150
"151","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",151
"152","31013. Did they ask for a renewal of the lease?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",152
"153","—I don't know. But allow me to state that the expenditure on Kirkton in 1858, when it was held by four tenants, was £68. In 1859 the old glebe was added, at a rent of £30, making the whole rent divisible amongst the tenants £98. The sum of £802, 2s. 4d. was expended on buildings for them, and £2252, 11s . 6d. on improving their lands, —together £3054, 13s. 10d. In 1862, after the completion of the improvements, the rent, which was rising gradually, reached £180 = £2, 13s. per cent, on the outlay. In 1881, the rent was reduced by £36, so that it is now £144, leaving only £1, 10s. per cent, on the outlay.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",153
"154","31014. So that in fact the rent which the tenants pay is not equal to interest at 5 per cent, on the money expended ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",154
"155","—No, it is not.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",155
"156","31015. In your opinion, was that money all profitably expended?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",156
"157","—I did not see the improvements going on. It is from the books I have taken these figures.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",157
"158","31016. But can it be fairly said that any of that money was wastefully spent, or spent in an unscientific or improper manner?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",158
"159","—No, it was not.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",159
"160","31017. You believe it was all required?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",160
"161","—Yes; but it was very expensively done, and the reason of that was that it was mostly done by home labour.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",161
"162","31018. Were the materials used all good of their kind?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",162
"163","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",163
"164","31019. Were the drains properly laid?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",164
"165","—I have not seen them, but I know they are very much neglected. They say they are out of order, but it is their own fault. There was one portion, going down by the side of the churchyard here, and the burn was causewayed for carrying the water into the sea, and some of the tenants put stones into the bed of the burn, charging its channel and cutting up the roads. Sir Alexander, this last spring, at his own expense, cleared out the damaged burn, and repaired the road to see if that would stimulate the people to take better care. They are allowing their houses and dykes to go to wreck. Their houses are dirty, although a few hours a day in one week about their houses, and two or three days' labour each during the year would keep the drains and ditches right and their houses clean and tidy.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",165
"166","31020. How much of the sum of money you mentioned do the tenants pay interest on ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",166
"167","—One and a-half per cent, on the whole.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",167
"168","31021. Do you find there is any disinclination on the part of the crofters to have improvements made for them by the landlords, the landlord charging interest?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",168
"169","—They wish to have it done for them, and when they find the interest is rising up they want the interest taken off; and some say they would rather not have the improvements.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",169
"170","31022. In point of fact, the tenants, instead of paying, as I thought when the witness was being examined, 5 per cent., are only paying 1½| per cent ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",170
"171","—One and a-half.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",171
"172","31023. Aere any of the tenants paying 5 per cent.?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",172
"173","—None that I am aware of. The Plockton tenants are charged 5 per cent, upon the drainage and fences.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",173
"174","31024. Have they complained of it at all?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",174
"175","—No, there is no delegate from Plockton here.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",175
"176","31025. I understand you to say that the grazings which Mr Brown declined to renew his lease of, would not be suitable for crofters ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",176
"177","—No, when Mr Brown would not take them for sheep.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",177
"178","31026. And the same thing woidd apply to the grazings abandoned by Messrs Weir and Kellie ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",178
"179","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",179
"180","31027. And the same to Mr Maclennan's?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",180
"181","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",181
"182","31028. These farms were all given up voluntarily ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",182
"183","—They were. Mr Weir not only gave up his voluntarily, but he was endeavouring for two years to get Sir Alexander to relieve him, because he was constantly losing money.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",183
"184","31029. They all consist of high ground?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",184
"185","—An average height of 2400 feet.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",185
"186","31030. And you found it impossible to let them as sheep farms?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",186
"187","—We did.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",187
"188","31031. And they are all unsuitable for crofters?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",188
"189","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",189
"190","31032. Supposing there had been no such thing-as deer forests, what would have been done with these farms?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",190
"191","—They would have lain on the proprietor's hands, or he might have taken any small rent he could get. Mr Brown was paying £1050 of rent for the whole farm, including those parts. But in 1878 he offered £900 for the portion he now has, and the forested part he was only valuing at £150. Sir Alexander Matheson made a general reduction of rents two or three years ago, and took off the rent £60, leaving it at £840; and £60 for trenches makes £900, £160 remains for the grazings and the portion forested, and the valuation roll will show that Lord Lovat is paying £1600, and that is what helps to reduce the rates of the parish.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",191
"192","31033. We have heard from several delegates that they consider, if portions of the sheep farms were given to crofters, the proprietor would not be a loser, because he would obtain the same rate per acre for those lands as is now paid by the sheep farmer ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",192
"193","—I believe he would.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",193
"194","31034. Therefore, if there were suitable lands in the district which might be added to the crofts, you would not hesitate to recommend Sir Alexander on the score of rental to do that ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",194
"195","—Oh no; and Sir Alexander has done that when he had the land to give them. As the old man from Sallachy stated, Sir Alexander Matheson has given him a portion of ground ; and at Loch Carron, on the estate of Attadale, a farm which was occupied by one tenant is now subdivided, and occupied by three respectable tenants and a few small crofts. Sir Alexander is not in favour of large farms, but the contrary; and he is not in favour of non-resident tenants.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",195
"196","31035. But you still adhere to the answer you gave to the Chairman, that in your opinion there is, at the present moment, after what Sir Alexander has done, no suitable ground now in the occupation of sheep farmers, whose leases might shortly be out, and which might be added to the crofts ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",196
"197","—There is none except this portion of Avernish, which Sir Alexander would give to crofters who would be self-supporting. I may further state that a year ago last spring, Sir Alexander sent Mr Watson and myself along the crofts on the west side of the estate to see if it was possible to get an acre of land to give to the people; and after going for days over the place we could not see one acre of land to improve.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",197
"198","31036. You saw no place which you could turn into grazing for the crofters ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",198
"199","—No, none.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",199
"200","31037. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",200
"201","—You state that £6400 was expended upon improvements on the small tenants. That includes Kirkton; there were £2500 spent upon other small holdings. I took down from you that there were 154 crofters under £4, 72 from £ 4 to £6, 38 from £6 to £10, 45 from £ 10 to £20, and 24 from £20 to £30. In that way the number of crofters under £ 30 is close upon 350?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",201
"202","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",202
"203","31038. The expenditure of £6400 goes from the period from 1852 to 1882 ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",203
"204","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",204
"205","31039. And you make out that the average is £18 a year spent on the crofters ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",205
"206","—It was not annually spent, it was done all at once.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",206
"207","31040. But it is an average of £18 a year ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",207
"208","—Very probably it is.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",208
"209","31041. And if you reduce that a little more, you will find all you spend on each crofter per annum is something between 10s. and 15s?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",209
"210","—There are some to whom nothing at all has been given.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",210
"211","31042. But I want the average of the whole?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",211
"212","—That average won't work.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",212
"213","31043. I want you to make your own calculation. Take your £6400 and divide it among the 335, and I think you will find the average is not quite £20 ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",213
"214","—No.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",214
"215","31044. Divide that £20 over thirty years. I want to ascertain what has been expended per head per annum over the crofters?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",215
"216","—I cannot work the question out, because I don't see the force of it. Some years there was no expenditure at all.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",216
"217","31045. You have come forward to make a statement showing there is a large sum laid out on the crofters in thirty years ; I want to show what it comes to—that it is 15s. per crofter per annum, and I want to know if that is right ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",217
"218","—Just about that.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",218
"219","31046. I want to ask you how long have you been principal factor for Sir Alexander Matheson ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",219
"220","—A year last February.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",220
"221","31047. But you have been long connected with the estate?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",221
"222","—I have been thirty-six years in his service.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",222
"223","31048. But not on this part?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",223
"224","—No.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",224
"225","31049. So that you don't know much about this estate from personal observation ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",225
"226","—I know a great deal for the last fifteen years, but it is only during the last year that I have taken so much interest in it.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",226
"227","31050. You have a copy of the census returns. I think you will find that there is a decrease during the last ten years in the parish of Lochalsh of 547 ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",227
"228","—Yes, and an increase of 400 in the century. ",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",228
"229","31051. Is Sir Alexander Matheson sole heritor in the parish?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",229
"230","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",230
"231","31052. Are you quite content with the present state of matters in the parish generally ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",231
"232","—Yes, the people and we are agreeing very well.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",232
"233","31053. That being so, how can you explain that such a large decrease in the population has taken place in ten years as 547 ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",233
"234","—You are mistaken, it is in the last forty years that the decrease has taken place.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",234
"235","31051. It is not shown from 1851?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",235
"236","—No, but there is a deduction of somewhere about 200. Say we take 1861, being the first period after",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",236
"237","Sir Alexander Matheson became proprietor, the population then was 2413, and it is now 2050.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",237
"238","31055. There is a considerable decrease even in that time?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",238
"239","—363.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",239
"240","31056. Will you explain how that decrease has arisen?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",240
"241","—I cannot tell; natural causes, I suppose. You always see when things go to an excess, they remedy themselves by going perhaps to the opposite extreme. I believe, considering the whole, Lochalsh is not under-populated.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",241
"242","31057. What is the acreage of the parish altogether?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",242
"243","—51,000 odd acres.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",243
"244","31058. How many of the population of 2050 is in the town of Plockton ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",244
"245","—About 440 at last census; so that there are 1500 throughout the rest of the parish.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",245
"246","31059. You said with regard to Avernish, that you understood the people went away to America in the time of the Lillingstones, because they would not submit to certain rules?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",246
"247","—That is what I have been told.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",247
"248","31060. Did you ever see the rules?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",248
"249","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",249
"250","31061. Will you send us a copy ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",250
"251","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",251
"252","31062. Was it, or was it not, the fact that Mr Lillingstone had almost the whole of the property in his own hands when Sir Alexander Matheson got it ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",252
"253","—He had a good deal of it. I believe Kilellan and Avernish and Balmacara and some other parts were in his own hands.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",253
"254","31063. A great part of the estate was in the proprietor's own hand in consequence of the rules?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",254
"255","—No, not in consequence of the rules.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",255
"256","31064. But it is a fact that it was in his own hands?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",256
"257","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",257
"258","31065. Was there a great deal of dissatisfaction expressed on the property?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",258
"259","—I cannot say.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",259
"260","31066. Can you tell me whether it is true that a number of the people who were sent off to America died on the passage ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",260
"261","—I have heard so. They caught an infectious fever in Glasgow before sailing, and the fever broke out in the ship, and since then the people in the district there have an antipathy to emigration.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",261
"262","31067. You think it is owing to that that the antipathy to emigration has arisen ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",262
"263","—The Highlander, I believe, particularly has stuck to the soil, and has an antipathy to emigration.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",263
"264","31068. You used an expression which I wish you would explain: you said that if there was any interference with the larger farms, and they were broken up, it would ' spoil the amenity ' of the estate; what do you mean?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",264
"265","—I mean the manner in which Sir Alexander has the whole estate so well arranged—large farms and small farms mixed together.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",265
"266","31069. But you said he did not like the large farms?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",266
"267","—I told you the size of them.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",267
"268","31070. There are two over £400 ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",268
"269","—They cannot be broken down.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",269
"270","31071. You said there was a general reduction of rent some time ago, but the delegate from Port-a-chullin had not got any advantage. Why did he not get a reduction ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",270
"271","—His arable land had to be drained, and that was done.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",271
"272","31072. And that is the allowance?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",272
"273","—Yes. ",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",273
"274","31073. The rent was so small it was not worth giving a reduction in money ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",274
"275","—It was considered that it was cheap enough.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",275
"276","31074. What was the rent of Roderick Macrae ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",276
"277","—£4, but the arable land had to be drained where required, and that was done. ",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",277
"278","31075. You stated that Sir Alexander was good enough to give a general abatement of rent ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",278
"279","—Not to all the crofters; he gave it to the Alt-na-stu crofters and others.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",279
"280","31076. It is very convenient is it not for a proprietor, when he cannot get his large sheep farms let, to get a sporting tenant to take it in the form of a deer forest ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",280
"281","—No, it is not very convenient in this quarter.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",281
"282","31077. Is it remunerative?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",282
"283","—Undoubtedly it is.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",283
"284","31078. What would happen under your new system, supposing that anything be done by Act of Parliament or otherwise, which would diminish the powers and rights of letting game ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",284
"285","—That is too wide a question to answer off-hand ; it requires consideration.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",285
"286","31079. You are not disposed to offer any solution of what you would do in the circumstances?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",286
"287","—Not without thinking.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",287
"288","31080. Would it be wiser and safer in the circumstances to revert to things as of old ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",288
"289","—I don't think it would, because things as they were of old were very badly managed. The people were dissatisfied, and quarrelling among themselves, as far as I can hear from old reminiscences, and they were not so well off. They might be better off than they are now if they were prudent; there is a great deal of imprudence amongst them. But things as they were before were not at all consolidated, and I don't think it would be a benefit to the people to go back to the old system.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",289
"290","31081. But the old man whom we had to-day stated that in his younger days a Kintail man was worth half a dozen of those of the present day ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",290
"291","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",291
"292","31082. Don't you think he was in earnest ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",292
"293","—Yes, and telling the truth.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",293
"294","31083. Would not you like to see that state of matters restored?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",294
"295","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",295
"296","31084. What better way can you do that than by giving them the glens ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",296
"297","—By continuing to take the fine solid food the old people used to take, and throwing away slushes of tea. They are destroying their nervous system, and that causes the complete degeneration of the present race. Unless they go back to the old system of food, the race of the Gael will soon become extinct as the Gael.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",297
"298","31085. Are they not becoming extinct very rapidly? ",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",298
"299","—No ; but it is one good thing that the bloods are mixing up.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",299
"300","31086. Taking the population of the different populaces in 1841, the decrease of the population has been very serious. Gairloch has decreased 386, Glenshiel 381, Loch Carron 574 ; where is it to lead ? —It will soon come to the minimum, and then it will end, according to the gradation. I think in ten years more it ought to come to a minimum, and it will probably remain so.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",300
"301","31087. You think at the end of ten years there will be a proportionate diminution such as has occurred before. There will not he too many people then in the country ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",301
"302","—I think not.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",302
"303","31088. You would not go so far as a brother factor of yours, who said that in his districts—namely, three great parishes —one.half of the population would still require to go ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",303
"304","—That is a mistake. It would not be the case in my district.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",304
"305","31089. Still you think it will require a little thinning yet?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",305
"306","—I think so, because there are some poor people who cannot make a living, and there are no representatives here from them.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",306
"307","31090. Why ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",307
"308","—I don't know.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",308
"309","31091. There is no one to represent them?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",309
"310","—No one.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",310
"311","31092. Have you any particular township in view ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",311
"312","—Prumbuill and Ebersaig. There are twenty-one crofters on the former and nineteen on the latter.  When Sir Alexander Matheson bought the property there were twenty-two crofters in Ebersaig and now there are nineteen, and he can do nothing to better them, though he made a good deal of work for them too. There is one park he enclosed for them some years ago, but I am very sorry to say they don't take care of it ; they have allowed the fence to go to the ground.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",312
"313","31093. You would not like to see your countrymen obliged to leave their own land against their own wish if they could make anything of it ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",313
"314","—No ; but I know i t would benefit them very much to go.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",314
"315","31094. Would it benefit the country generally that they should go ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",315
"316","—In many cases it would.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",316
"317","31095. Is it not the fact that Strathbraan was once very populous?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",317
"318","—I believe it was.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",318
"319","31096. Why should not people be sent back there ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",319
"320","—It is too high.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",320
"321","31097. The railway runs through it ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",321
"322","—Yes ; but that it is not a place I would like to see broken up again, because the people would not be comfortable there.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",322
"323","31098. Is it not the fact that these people were removed under circumstances of harshness against their own will?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",323
"324","—I believe they were.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",324
"325","31099. Has a book not been written on the subject ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",325
"326","—I have not seen it.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",326
"327","31100. Do you not know that the Rev. Dr Kennedy of Dingwall has made very special reference to the clearance of Strathbraan ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",327
"328","—I have not seen it.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",328
"329","31101. Is your only objection to Strathbraan that it is too high?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",329
"330","—The people would not be comfortable in it.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",330
"331","31102. Were they comfortable before?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",331
"332","—No, they were not ; and one of them is now on Sir Alexander Matheson's property, a man of about seventy, and he told me that he and his mother were in Strathbraan. He was one of sixty people, and he said the place was very cold in winter, and very wet; and that the produce of the soil, sheep, and grain crop, were very dear, and the potatoes very wet",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",332
"333","31103. Is it not within reach of where we are at present sitting; what is the watershed there between the two seas ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",333
"334","—620 feet.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",334
"335","31104. Do you consider that high?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",335
"336","—It is not the elevation so much as t h e place being so stormy. The nearest station is Auchnasheen, which means Field of Storms. It is very cold and very wet, and just suitable for grazing purposes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",336
"337","31105. It would plant well?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",337
"338","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",338
"339","31106. Would not that shelter the people ?-",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",339
"340","—Tea.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",340
"341","31107. And would help to ameliorate the climate?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",341
"342","—Yes. But you must not make a pet of a man, or you will destroy his independence.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",342
"343","31108. Are the whole of Sir Alexander's deer forests, extending to 34,000 acres in this district, in possession of one person ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",343
"344","—No.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",344
"345","31109. Who is the second tenant ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",345
"346","—Major Cresswell of Attadale has 12,000.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",346
"347","31110. And the other is occupied by Mr Winans ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",347
"348","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",348
"349","31111. How much has he got?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",349
"350","—21,700 acres.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",350
"351","31112. Does all that is in the possession of Mr Winans lie in the county of Ross ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",351
"352","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",352
"353","31113. What forest has that gentleman got immediately adjoining you?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",353
"354","—He has the lands of Mr Mackenzie of Kintail and the land of the Chisholms—Sir Alexander  Matheson, He has 200,000 acres altogether.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",354
"355","31114. You made use of this expression as a reason why they would not be suitable for small tenants, that they were very high hills : are these places not on the borders ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",355
"356","—Mr Maclean. No, there are some of them inland ; two of them are on the borders. ",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",356
"357","31115. What is the highest inland ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",357
"358","—2950 feet. ",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",358
"359","31116. What is the name of that one?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",359
"360","—Mealvoy, that is the part that is forested.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",360
"361","31117. You have been present all day, and have heard the delegates?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",361
"362","—Yes.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",362
"363","31118. Do you think they have any grievance whatever?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",363
"364","—They expressed them.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",364
"365","31119. But you don't concur in them ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",365
"366","—No. There were some statements brought forward that were imaginary. For example, Mr Sinclair did not know what we knew, and he took his information from the parties who gave it, and they did not know. People don't know what money has been expended for them.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",366
"367","31120. But I am afraid it is not very much ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",367
"368","—But you go over the whole people for whom nothing has been done, and people for whom something would be done if it could. There are many for whom nothing has been done.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",368
"369","31121. When you stated that the sum of £6400 has been laid out in thirty years for crofters under £30 a-year, do you take credit for that to show that some people have taken a great deal and others  nothing; you must take a fair average ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",369
"370","—But something would be done for those people if there was a way of doing it, but there is no possibility of doing it. If these crofters were reduced about one-fourth, they would be all comfortable, and something could be done for them.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",370
"371","31122. You say, after full consideration, that the idea of replacing them is imaginary, and that they must emigrate ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",371
"372","—That is so, or remain as they are. The proprietor won't put out one of them.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",372
"373","31123. But they are not comfortable, and the next thing is to see what is the best way of making them comfortable",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",373
"374","—[Sir Alexander Matheson] ",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",374
"375","I want to end this discussion by making a statement.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",375
"376","31124. The Chairman.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",376
"377","—Excuse me. Will you have the great kindness then to come and sit down here ?",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",377
"378","—I only wish to say a few words.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",378
"379","31124*. Then I would wish you would rather do it as any other witness.",518,"Roderick Maclean","Ross-shire, Balmacara",379
