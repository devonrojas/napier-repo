"12","—Yes.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",12
"13","31807. What?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",13
"14","—We are ruled in every respect in the same way as they have described; but, as regards cattle, we have none at all. There is only one cow in our township. There were two a fortnight ago, now there is only one.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",14
"15","31808. How many heads of families are there in your township?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",15
"16","—Twenty-two who pay rent and four cottars; and there are two other houses inhabited, I believe, by paupers.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",16
"17","31809. To whom do the twenty-two crofters pay rent?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",17
"18","—Mr Baillie.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",18
"19","31810. To whom are the four cottars paying rent?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",19
"20","—Two pay to Mr Baillie, and the other two don't pay at all for their houses.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",20
"21","31811. You say there is only one cow among the twenty-two\crofters, have they no hill pasture at all?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",21
"22","—No.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",22
"23","31812. How were these two cows of whom you spoke supported?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",23
"24","—Before, this farmer was giving us grazing for the cows, and charging £ 3 for each.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",24
"25","31813. Was that the same farmer of whom we have heard?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",25
"26","—That was Mr Mundell of Eilanreoch.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",26
"27","31814. Used Mr Mundell to allow a cow's grass at the rate of £ 3 per cow to each of the twenty-two crofters, or only to a certain number?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",27
"28","—No, when he came first there were four cows, and he sent them all away and would not allow any to be kept.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",28
"29","31815. So you have had no cows except these two during the whole of Mr Mundell's tenancy?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",29
"30","—It was on the acres which they have among themselves that they grazed these two cows.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",30
"31","31816. Then the farm of Eilanreoch came into the proprietor's hands at Whitsunday last?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",31
"32","—Yes.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",32
"33","31817. Was there any change made about the grazing arrangements when Mr Baillie took it into his own hands?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",33
"34","—The people to whom the two cows belonged went to the factor and spoke to him on the subject, and he allowed them to send the cows to graze ; but they don't know yet what the rent will be for that.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",34
"35","31818. [To M'Intyre].",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",35
"36","—Have you anything to add to the statement made by your co-delegate on the subject of these cows?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",36
"37","—Nothing more about the cattle.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",37
"38","31819. [To M'Gillivray].",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",38
"39","—What became of the one cow that was pastured this year?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",39
"40","—She died.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",40
"41","31820. What rent do you pay?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",41
"42","—£2 for an acre of land.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",42
"43","31821. [To M'Intyre].",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",43
"44","—And what rent do you pay?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",44
"45","—The same; but on this side of the country they only pay £ 1 an acre.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",45
"46","31822. How do you and the other crofters support yourselves?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",46
"47","—We support ourselves by fishing, and not by the land.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",47
"48","31823. Do you mean herring fishing or white fishing?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",48
"49","—-The herring fishing alone.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",49
"50","31824. Do you get any employment at all in this district other than that of fishing?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",50
"51","—Not at all",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",51
"52","31825. Is there any land adjacent to your crofts which would be suitable for you if you could get it?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",52
"53","—Plenty, if the farmers would give it to us.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",53
"54","31826. Are the people very poor?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",54
"55","—We are not so very ill off; but no thanks for that to either the proprietor or farmer.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",55
"56","31827. Would the people be able to buy a cow apiece if they had the grazing for it?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",56
"57","—Some of them could, and many of them could not.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",57
"58","31828. If you got grazing for a cow apiece at a moderate rent, so as to give milk for your families, would you be satisfied with your acre of land, and continue to devote yourselves entirely to fishing?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",58
"59","—We would not.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",59
"60","31829. What would you like?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",60
"61","—We would desire five acres per croft.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",61
"62","31830. In order that you might be wholly independent of the fishing?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",62
"63","—No, I could do with the fishing besides that",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",63
"64","31831. If you were occupied in fishing could you manage five acres of land and do justice to it?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",64
"65","—We could.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",65
"66","31832. What stock would be required to go along with that five acres of arable land?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",66
"67","—Five cows.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",67
"68","31833. Would the people to whom you alluded just now as being partly able to purchase one cow be in a position to purchase five, or how many of the crofters would be able to buy five?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",68
"69","—Those of them who, I said, could buy one cow could not buy five.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",69
"70","31834. How many do you think could buy five?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",70
"71","—-There is not one of them could buy five.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",71
"72","31835. [To M'Gillivray].",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",72
"73","— Do you agree with your brother delegate that you would not be satisfied with an acre of ground, a cow's grass, and to continue to prosecute the fishing?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",73
"74","—I agree with the answer he gave to that question-",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",74
"75","31836-37. You both wish to become farmers in the sense that the chief portion of your time should be devoted to farming rather than to be fishermen with a home and a cow's grass?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",75
"76","—M'lntyre. We would prefer  that. There are some years when we can make no fishing, and if it were",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",76
"77","not for the merchants that help us we would not be alive. We would get no work from the proprietor.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",77
"78","—M'Gillivray. I have something to say about our houses. They are built on the shore. We built them ourselves, for the proprietor gave us no assistance. We had to pay for the wood which we got from him for the purpose. We spoke to the factor about a change of site for the houses, and as an answer he asked us whether the sea was coming over the roofs of them. We said it sometimes did ; and he told us then that we should put back doors upon them, and when the sea came in that we could run away. I should like to see himself flopping in the midst of them. I have something else to say about some assistance that he was going to give us. About eight or nine years ago a storehouse was erected by him for the sale of barrels for our fishing. He did this in order that we might get these things cheaper from him than they could be got elsewhere. When the salt came he charged 2s. 6d. a cwt., and two cwt. and a half go to make a barrel of salt. That was 6s. 3d. a barrel; and we can get the same quantity from the vessels which brought the salt into the loch for 3s. 6d. or 4s. Then second-hand barrels came to the store, and he charged 5s. for them. A bundle of hoops came with them, and they were lost. To prevent that loss falling upon the laird, there was 2d. added to the price of each barrel, and they were charged 5s. 2d. Now it is for you to judge whether the benefit was on his side or on ours ; I think it was for himself.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",78
"79","31838. Did the people get any assistance from the proprietor when they lost their boats in the storm two years ago?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",79
"80","—We got wood; and it would have been better for us to have bought it, such as it was; it would have been as cheap for us.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",80
"81","31839. Explain that?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",81
"82","—The wood came from Loch Duich. It was cut by the proprietor's people there, and the people who did the work were paid out of the money which was contributed for the assistance of the fishermen. When we went to get that wood there were some who required only one tree, and they spent two days and a night in going for it. If they had got the money which was subscribed for the purpose from the committee who had charge of it, it would have been cheaper for them to have bought the estate wood than to have gone for the wood to Loch Duich.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",82
"83","31840. The Chairman.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",83
"84","—Are you obliged to buy salt from the factor?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",84
"85","—We are not obliged to buy our salt out of the store.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",85
"86","31841. Does the factor still sell salt?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",86
"87","—He does; he has given the store to a man from the east country. He would not give it to any of us.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",87
"88","31842. Is the factor now quite separate from the store?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",88
"89","—Yes, as long as it is rented to the other man. He lost the trade of the salt, and was making no profit by it, and therefore he gave it up.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",89
"90","31843. Have you perfect liberty to buy all your commodities where you like?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",90
"91","—We have.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",91
"92","31844. Have you perfect liberty to sell your fish anywhere you like?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",92
"93","—Yes.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",93
"94","31845. You state that you pay £2 for one acre of land. That includes the stance of the house, I suppose?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",94
"95","—The proprietor says it is, but I say it is the Government land—that it is on the shore where the houses are built.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",95
"96","31846. Do I understand you right when you say the proprietor has never given you any sort of assistance either in building or repairing your houses ",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",96
"97","—We never did get any assistance; we had to pay for the wood which we put on the roof.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",97
"98","31847. Has the proprietor done anything to erect a pier or build a seawall for the protection of your houses, or has he ever done anything to encourage your industry of fishing?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",98
"99","—He never did anything of the kind. On the contrary, I think they would like that we should be put in",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",99
"100","wooden houses, and set out upon the sea.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",100
"101","31848. Has the proprietor ever shown you any kindness, or assisted you in sickness, or done anything for your families in any respect?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",101
"102","—He has not; he has never come our way.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",102
"103","31849. In consequence of the scarcity last year, was there any distribution of seed or food to the poor in your place?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",103
"104","—I think we got about one peck of potatoes in our family; and if it grows well he will get the peck back,",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",104
"105","31850. Are you expected to pay for these seed potatoes, or were they given to you as a gift?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",105
"106","—-We got them as a gift, but the greater part of them were not worth planting. They had gone to nought before we got them.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",106
"107","31851. How much land will a peck of potatoes plant?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",107
"108","—I cannot say. A peck is the fourth part of a barrel",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",108
"109","31852. But would it plant half an acre?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",109
"110","—I think twenty yards square is about the most that it would plant.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",110
"111","31853. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",111
"112","—Has there been any work of any consequence going on on the estate for some years past?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",112
"113","—The sub-factor had some works going on, for which he employed people of his own choosing; but none of us got any of the work.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",113
"114","31854. What kind of works were they?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",114
"115","—Fencing and cutting trees and that kind of work.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",115
"116","—[M'Intyre]. It is from Mr Bass we get work.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",116
"117","31855. May we say that all the rental that can be drained from the estate, is spent elsewhere?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",117
"118","—He does not spend a shilling of it upon us, at any rate.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",118
"119","31856. Are the people in your township of Camusbain able to purchase milk for the use of the children?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",119
"120","—Some can and some cannot.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",120
"121","31857. From whom do you purchase it1?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",121
"122","—Mr Milligan's manager.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",122
"123","31858. How many cows does he keep?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",123
"124","—I cannot tell.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",124
"125","31859. Does he keep so many that he can afford to sell you the milk?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",125
"126","—No.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",126
"127","31860. So that, practically, even if the tenant were willing to sell them milk, they could not get it?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",127
"128","—No.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",128
"129","31861. That is to say, if every one of the people were able to buy milk?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",129
"130","—Yes. Four years ago they wished to put a tax of 9s. of road money upon every member of our population of eighteen years and upwards, whether the person had land or not, or whether there were twenty members in a family or one; and, what is more curious, I have the receipt for that, in which there is no name of any person to whom the money is paid. This is the receipt:",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",130
"131","—Mr Archibald M'Gillivray, Camusbain, Glenelg District Road Trust, 1879, March 25.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",131
"132","—To road assessment for the year ending Whitsunday 1879, 9s.' I did not pay it.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",132
"133","—[M'Intyre]. That notice was sent to every person of eighteen years and upwards in Arnisdale.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",133
"134","—[M'Gillivray]. That notice came from Mr France, the sub-factor, who was also postmaster, and sent these notices by the post.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",134
"135","31862. How long was Mr France factor?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",135
"136","—[M'Intyre]. He was factor all along in our opinion.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",136
"137","31863. Was he postmaster all the time?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",137
"138","—No.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",138
"139","31864. How long was he postmaster?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",139
"140","—[M'Gillivray]. I am not sure.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",140
"141","31865. Was he in that office for a year or two?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",141
"142","—More than that.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",142
"143","—[M'intyre]. Four or five years.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",143
"144","31866. Would every letter that was sent away and every letter that came be seen by him?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",144
"145","—Yes.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",145
"146","31867. Did the people like such thing as that?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",146
"147","—They didn't.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",147
"148","31868. Was there any competent person belonging to Glenelg who could do the business except the factor?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",148
"149","—[M'Intyre]. There were plenty;  but he wanted that and more for himself if he could have got it.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",149
"150","31869. Professor Mackinnon.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",150
"151","—What is your rent?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",151
"152","—[M'Gillivray]. We are to pay £2, the same as at Corran.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",152
"153","31870. And each one at Camusbain paying rent got this notice to pay road money?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",153
"154","—It was sent to every person of eighteen and upwards.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",154
"155","31871. Was it sent to every one, whether he paid rent or not?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",155
"156","—It was.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",156
"157","31872. Your boats were much injured by the high tide of two years ago, were they not?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",157
"158","—Yes.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",158

"160","—Yes.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",160
"161","31874. That is what you meant when you said that some of the people required only one stick?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",161
"162","— That is so.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",162
"163","31875. That some of the boats required less mending than others?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",163
"164","—Yes.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",164
"165","31876. Who had the distribution of the money which was contributed for meeting this disaster?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",165
"166","—The committee included Mr Macdonald, parish minister; Mr Fraser, teacher; Mr M'Intosh, of the hotel; the doctor; and somebody else whom I don't remember; Mr M'Leod, Free Church minister.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",166
"167","31877. It was not the School Board who had the distribution of it?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",167
"168","—I think the members of the School Board were on that committee.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",168
"169","31878. The schoolmaster was not on the School Board?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",169

"174","— [M Gillivray]. Latterly, but not at first.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",174

"176","—Yes, it was the committee that paid the expense of cutting the wood.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",176
"177","31881. I suppose they thought that would be a better and a cheaper arrangement, because the proprietor would give the wood for nothing, than to go and buy the timber elsewhere?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",177
"178","—It seems that was their opinion.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",178
"179","31882. But you think because you had to go so far away for it, that it would have perhaps been cheaper to have bought prepared timber for you, than to have sent you to Loch Duich for the felled tree?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",179
"180","—Yes, it was dearer for those who wanted only a little wood.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",180
"181","—[M'Intyre]. France refused it to mè although it was cut at Loch Duich, and I had applied to the committee to get it there. I had to go and buy it at Sleat, on the estate of Lord Macdonald at Armadale.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",181
"182","31883. If you required a great deal of timber it would have been cheaper to have got it at Loch Duich, than to go and buy it in the market?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",182
"183","—It would.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",183
"184","31884. What do you mean by saying that the site of your house is upon Government land, and not upon Mr Baillie's land?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",184
"185","—Because it is under high water mark, and the sea goes over it when there are high tides sometimes.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",185
"186","31885. It is because there is a belief among you that a fisherman is entitled to build upon the sea-shore to enable him to prosecute the fishing; is that the explanation?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",186
"187","—[M'Gillivray]. No; but we think when he charges us £2 for the house when it is upon the sea-shore, and liable to be over-run by the sea, that these houses ought to have been built by himself for which he so charges.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",187
"188","31886. Do your houses front the sea?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",188

"190","31887. The doors are to the sea?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",190
"191","—Yes.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",191
"192","31888. And when the factor advised you to open the back door it was to enable you to escape by the back because there could be no escape by the front?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",192
"193","—Yes; we were not so foolish but that we knew that without his telling us.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",193
"194","31889. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",194
"195","—Did the estate management ask you to perform any labour for repairing or making the roads?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",195
"196","—Yes, we were doing three days' work per annum.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",196
"197","31890. And was this payment of 9s. in place of that labour?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",197
"198","—No, we are now paying 6d. in the pound.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",198
"199","31891. But did this payment come in place of the three days' labour ",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",199
"200","—Yes, it was after the three days' work ceased that this notice came.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",200
"201","31892. And was that three days' labour given by every male over, eighteen years in the place?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",201
"202","—No, it was not in France's time at all. The three days were only upon each croft, and for one person to do the work.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",202
"203","31893. And when did that cease?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",203
"204","—I think about seven years ago.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",204
"205","31894. And have you paid anything in place of it since?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",205
"206","—Two years, ago we paid 6d. in the pound, and last year we paid Is.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",206
"207","31895. Do you know in whose handwriting the notice is that you showed?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",207
"208","—I don't know.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",208
"209","31896. How was it delivered to you?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",209
"210","—By the postman.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",210
"211","31897. Who is the tenant of Astour?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",211
"212","—James Thin, from Macduff.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",212
"213","31898. Is he a curer?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",213
"214","—Yes,",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",214
"215","31899. Do you sell fish to him?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",215
"216","—Yes; he buys the herring in autumn.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",216
"217","31900. Did you want the store for yourselves?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",217
"218","—A man belonging to the place wanted it to live in, but he could not get it.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",218
"219","31901. Is it not more advantageous to you to have a curer there?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",219
"220","—There were plenty other curers at that time.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",220
"221","31902. You stated that you had grazing for your cows on Eilanreoch, and that you purchased your meal from Mr Milligan in Arnisdale—are you situated on the march between these farms?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",221
"222","—We just lie between the two.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",222
"223","31903. And the addition to the land, you presume, might be taken from either farm?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",223
"224","—It would be most convenient for us to get it from Mr Milligan's farm; that is the pasture which we had before.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",224
"225","31901. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",225
"226","—Are you aware that compulsory labour on the roads has been entirely done away with, and an assessment laid on of so much in the pound of rent?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",226
"227","—We think so, because we have been paying that assessment for the last two years.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",227
"228","31905. The Chairman.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",228
"229","—Were the roads upon which the people gave this obligatory labour public roads, or branch roads for the service of your own township?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",229
"230","—It was the high road over the country side.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",230
"231","31906. And was it a road which was maintained by the assessment or a road maintained by the proprietor and yourselves?",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",231
"232","—It was a road maintained by the assessments paid by the proprietor and occupiers.",538,"Archibald Fletcher Mcgillivray, John Mcintyre","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",232
