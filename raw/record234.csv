"1","RODERICK ROSS, Crofter, Geocrab (63)—examined.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",1
"2","13195. The Chairman.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",2
"3","—Were you freely elected by your people?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",3
"4","—Yes.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",4
"5","13196. Have you a written statement?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",5
"6","—No. It is only four days since we got notice of this meeting, which was conveyed to us by the Rev. Mr Davidson.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",6
"7","13197. Then what statement have you to make on the part of your people ?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",7
"8","—It is now thirty-five or thirty-six years since I went to live in the Bays. There were eleven crofts or lots when I went to live at Geocrab. There was only one cottar's house there at that time. There are now twenty-six crofters, who have the same lands among them that the eleven had. I may call them all cottars except three. The rest have only bits of the land that their fathers had.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",8
"9","13198. How many families are there altogether at this moment?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",9
"10","—Twenty-six of all classes.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",10
"11","13199. Are the additional families the natural increase of the original families, or have they been brought in from other places ?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",11
"12","—There is one family that came from Sir Edward Scott's property.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",12
"13","13200. Only one?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",13
"14","—Another from Lewis. The rest grew up in the place.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",14
"15","13201. Since you came there, has any common pasture land or any other land been taken away from the people ?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",15
"16","—No. Before my time the land was divided into eight lots by a surveyor—Mr M'Lade. Then after that there were three additional crofts taken off these eight, increasing the number to eleven, and there was no reduction in the rent of the eight.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",16
"17","13202. But my question was, since the time of the eleven lots has any of the land been taken from you and given to the tacksman ?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",17
"18","—No. There was no land taken away in Geocrab.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",18
"19","13203. Has the whole rent of Geocrab been increased in your time?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",19
"20","—Lord Dunmore has not raised the rent one penny so far as I know, or his father or mother before him.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",20
"21","13204. What stock do you keep yourself?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",21
"22","—I have a right to keep four cows, but as I have only half a croft I can only keep two cows. The other half of my croft was given to a brother-in law of mine.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",22
"23","13205. No horses ?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",23
"24","—There is not a horse to be seen in the place. It is all rocks. We are so surrounded by rocks that sometimes we never see the sun at all. There are three hours of the day when we don't know there is a sun at all. There is no prohibition of horses.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",24
"25","13206. How many sheep do you keep?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",25
"26","—I have about a dozen sheep, but I might keep as many as I like.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",26
"27","13207. Is the common pasture very large?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",27
"28","—Yes ; our hill marches with Lord Dunmore's forest, but there is no prohibition how far we may extend our pasture. We suffer no injury or trouble from being on the same march with him.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",28
"29","13208. What rent do you pay?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",29
"30","—£6, Os. 6d. of rent, and 10s. of taxes. Up to four years ago I was paying 17s. 6d., now I only pay 10s. There was 10s. of road money at that time.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",30
"31","13209. Then what is the chief complaint ?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",31
"32","—The complaint is that at the time I spoke of first there were only eight or eleven crofters, when we had land enough to let a sufficient quantity of it lie fallow and recover its strength, which it cannot now do.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",32
"33","13210. Is there any part of Lord Dunmore's forest which would be useful as arable ground ?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",33
"34","—The forest is, for the most part, quite unsuited for cultivation ; the only ground near us suitable for cultivation is Luscantire.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",34
"35","13211. Sheriff Nicolson.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",35
"36","—But there never were any crofters there ?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",36
"37","—It is not suitable for crofters. It is mostly wild moor, and some pasture lower down.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",37
"38","13212. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",38
"39","—Has not the farm of Luscantire had a reputation in former times for its cattle ?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",39
"40","—Yes, the lower part of it—Shellibost and Isibost—is very well situated. That is good land.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",40
"41","13213. You have stated that you only received notice that the Commission was to sit here to-day four days ago. Don't you receive newspapers in this place ?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",41
"42","—We heard there was such a Commission, but knew nothing of the time they would be here. Mr Davidson himself did not know.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",42
"43","13214. Are you not aware that notices were sent some considerable time ago, though there seems to have been some accident ?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",43
"44","—[Rev. Mr Davidson.—There was notice sent to me, but it was just on Friday last week that I received it from the secretary of the Commission.]",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",44
"45","—I am not aware that the notices were sent any sooner.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",45
"46","13215. Would there have been more delegates appointed if there had been time?",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",46
"47","—There might have been more, but they would have nothing more to say than I have told.",234,"Roderick Ross","Harris, Obe",47
