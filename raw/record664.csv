"1","JAMES ROSS, Crofter, Breackwell (42)—examined.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",1
"2","39929. The Chairman. ",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",2
"3","—Have you a paper to read to the Commission?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",3
"4","—Yes. ' My father took a croft of three or four acres of arable land at Slestary in 1833, with hill pasture attached, at a rent of £17. He built a new house and farm steading on it. In 1838 the best part of the hill ground was taken off and put to the factor's sheep farm, and the rent reduced to £12. After the marches were thus altered it was allowed to be the dearest croft on Skibo estate. My father was yearly adding a little to the croft, and paying his rent up to the time of his death in1858. My mother,  and children after him, continued to do the same until she died in 1863. Then my brother and my sister along with me continued reclaiming land as we were able, and in 1876 the croft contained twelve acres arable, well limed, and in regular rotation. The valuator that valued the estate for Mr Sutherland Walker said it was the best cultivated croft in the district. In 1876 Mr Sutherland Walker, by his new marches, reduced the croft to seven acres, and cut off all the outlying pasture. For the croft as now reduced he wanted £6, 10s., binding me at the same time to improve five acres on a ten years' lease. I could not agree to this, and was obliged to give up the place without compensation for buildings or land improvement. He has not settled with me for the valuation of manure, fallow land, and damaged crops. Having disagreed about Slestary,'he pressed me several times to take Breackwell, to which I had the same objections, and could never agree to take it on his conditions. But my brother Robert, in his anxiety to see his brother and his sister and myself in a home, agreed to take the place on the proprietor's representation of it, and promising to see us comfortable. In 1880, two acres of the turnip crop was destroyed by a burn overflowing its banks on account of the drains he made in the moor above; and in 1882 second year's grass and other pasture were damaged by another burn overflowing on account of obstructions left in it by parties digging for sand by his authority. On being rendered an account of these damages for payment, he repudiated, and told me to take legal steps to recover it; that the land was his, and he could do with it what he pleased. The outgoing tenant of this place carried off the best part of the straw that grew on it, and used the best part of the fallow land for potatoes, but we at the end of the lease are not allowed to carry away the straw nor plant potatoes; and in this way we pay ten rents for nine crops. This was not understood by us when the lease was signed. The tenant of the adjoining croft at Slestary, containing about nine acres arable at a rent of £13, 10s., is bound to improve nine acres, and to build a new dwelling-house and steadings.'",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",4
"5","39930. Mr Cameron.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",5
"6","—This statement is more that of a personal grievance than that of a body of crofters?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",6
"7","—Yes.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",7
"8","39931. Are you referring to other people?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",8
"9","—To some.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",9
"10","39932. Did they send you here to speak for them?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",10
"11","—There are some who have grievances similar to this.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",11
"12","39933. But of course they cannot be quite alike?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",12
"13","—Not quite alike.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",13
"14","39934. Is the matter of the burn overflowing common to the place?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",14
"15","—No, it is personal to myself.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",15
"16","39935. Then, which of the grievances mentioned here affects your neighbours as well as yourself?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",16
"17","—They complain of high rent and want of compensation for improved lands and dwellings, and they want fixity of tenure, and not having pasture.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",17
"18","39936. Have they ever had pasture?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",18
"19","—Yes.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",19
"20","39937. When?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",20
"21","—They were deprived of their pasture about thirty-eight years ago.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",21
"22","39938. Now, what have they done in the way of improvement for which they want compensation?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",22
"23","—They have no satisfaction for all their labour. There are some crofters who improved their land to such an extent, and they are not allowed compensation even on their removal",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",23
"24","39939. In what way did they improve their crofts?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",24
"25","—By cultivating it out of moor or bad ground.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",25
"26","39940. When did they begin these improvements; how long ago?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",26
"27","—This was the system upon the estate, that the estate was over-rented since this man got it.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",27
"28","39941. When did they begin the improvements?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",28
"29","—It was small lots the tenants were taking. They were taking the hill and improving the crofts themselves, making a kind of a home first.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",29
"30","39942. How long ago?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",30
"31","—I cannot say.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",31
"32","39943. Was it thirty eight years ago, or before that, or after?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",32
"33","—Before it.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",33
"34","39944. Have their rents been raised since?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",34
"35","—Yes, several times.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",35
"36","39945. As I understand you, they complain not so much of the want of compensation, as because their rents have been raised upon their own improvements?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",36
"37","—Their rents are heavily raised upon their own improvements.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",37
"38","39946. Have any of them left the estate and asked for compensation for what they have done?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",38
"39","—Yes, some of them left the estate.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",39
"40","39947. Did they ask for compensation?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",40
"41","—They did not get any compensation.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",41
"42","39948. Did they ask for it?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",42
"43","—I cannot say. Most likely they did.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",43
"44","39949. Can you give us any dates? You seem to be not very well acquainted with the dates; but to arrive at any fair conclusion, we must know how long ago these improvements were made, and how often the rents were raised upon the improvements. Have you got that information?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",44
"45","—No, I have not got it; but there are some to come forward that can show it.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",45
"46","39950. The Chairman.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",46
"47","—Which delegate is best acquainted with the dates of old times?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",47
"48","—I think James Sutherland.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",48

"50","—I am paying 17s. 6d.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",50
"51","39952. Did you improve it yourself or got it improved?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",51
"52","—I improved it where I was before I came to Breackwell.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",52
"53","39953. But when you came to Breackwell you received the ground already cultivated?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",53
"54","—Yes.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",54
"55","39954. And you pay 17s. 6d. ?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",55
"56","— Yes.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",56
"57","39955. Is there any outrun?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",57
"58","—There is no outrun except four or five acres, and it is charged Is. per acre.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",58
"59","39956. Then it is 17s. 6d. for improved arable, and Is. for unimproved pasture?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",59
"60","—Yes.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",60
"61","39957. Is the common pasture capable of being turned into arable?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",61
"62","—Yes, but at a great deal of expense.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",62
"63","39958. How many acres of arable have you got in your present holding?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",63

"68","—£20, 5s.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",68
"69","39961. What stock do you keep?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",69
"70","—Two cows and two horses; I think that would be about the stock of the place.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",70
"71","39962. Is it the stock you actually do keep?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",71
"72","—No, for at times I may have a little more, and at times I may be under it; but it is about what",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",72
"73","the place can keep.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",73
"74","39963. Can you produce enough food to support your family in meal and potatoes during the whole year?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",74
"75","—Yes.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",75
"76","39964. Are you able to sell potatoes?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",76
"77","—Ye",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",77
"78","39965. Are you able to sell a stirk every year?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",78
"79","—No; there are several years that there will not be a stirk. When a man has two cows, perhaps, they will go wrong at times.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",79
"80","39966. Have you got a lease?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",80
"81","—Yes.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",81
"82","39967. If you have a lease, does it not provide for any compensation at the end of it?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",82
"83","—No.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",83
"84","39968. Why did you not put that in?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",84
"85","—That is my grievance.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",85
"86","39969. But when you made the lease, why did you not stipulate with the proprietor for compensation?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",86
"87","—It was my brother took the lease.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",87
"88","39970. Why did not your brother make a provision to save you?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",88
"89","—The proprietor would not grant it upon that condition.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",89
"90","39971. You complain of no pasture?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",90
"91","—Yes.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",91
"92","39972. Is there any sheep farm or pasture farm on the march?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",92

"94","39973. Part of which might be given to you?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",94
"95","—The whole of it is quite vacant, and it might be given to the whole of the tenants.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",95
"96","39974. Would they consider that a great advantage?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",96
"97","—Yes, a great advantage.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",97
"98","39975. Would they be disposed to pay additional rent for it?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",98
"99","—Of course they would. ",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",99
"100","39976. Who is the proprietor now?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",100
"101","—Mr Sutherland Walker.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",101
"102","39977. Have the tenants ever made any proposal to him to give them some of the pasture off the farm?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",102
"103","—I cannot say about that.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",103
"104","39978. Is the farm held under a lease?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",104
"105","—No, no lease, no stock; it is under game.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",105
"106","39979. What kind of game?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",106
"107","—Grouse.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",107

"111","—There are deer in the woods beside it.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",111
"112","39982. Is it held by the proprietor, or is it let?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",112
"113","—It is held by the proprietor.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",113
"114","39983. How long has it been like it, without any stock at all?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",114
"115","—About two or three years.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",115
"116","39984. What was before that?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",116
"117","—It was a sheep farm, but it was first occupied by tenants. In the year 1838 it was under tenants, and then the factor got it, and turned it into a sheep farm. He was turning out the tenants day by day.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",117
"118","39985. Is there a fence between the crofters' arable and the forest?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",118
"119","—In bits there is, but where it is the fence is put up at the tenant's own expense by paying so much yearly.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",119
"120","39986. What sort of fence is it?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",120
"121","—A wire fence where it is.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",121
"122","39987. Which do the most harm, the birds or the deer?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",122
"123","—Where I am I will not complain of either one or the other.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",123
"124","39988. Does any one complain?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",124
"125","—Yes, some of the tenants are complaining of them.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",125
"126","39989. What do they complain of most?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",126
"127","—Those that are on the hill complain of the grouse, but those that are in the down-lying district complain most of deer.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",127
"128","39990. When they complain does the proprietor give them any compensation?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",128
"129","—Not any compensation. It is in the lease that there is to be no compensation for any thing of the sort.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",129
"130","39991. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",130
"131","—What was the name of the factor who turned out the small people day by day?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",131
"132","—Forbes.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",132
"133","39992. Where is he now?",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",133
"134","—He is in the grave.",664,"James Ross","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",134
