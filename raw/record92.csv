"1","KENNETH M'RAE, Fisherman, Dunan (54)—examined. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",1
"2","4953. The Chairman.",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",2
"3","—Are you a cottar ?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",3
"4","—I have a lot, but it is not a lot. It was taken from me, but my name is in the books yet. The schoolhouse, of which the former delegate spoke, was built on the half lot which I had, and the best part of the lot was taken from me—the part in which I used to plant potatoes, which I have been doing fer twenty years without changing seed. There was no other part of my lot cultivable except gennett what was built upon for the schoolhouse. The schoolhouse was placed on it, and other land was promised me, but I never got it; and what was left of the lot to me. There are three gates on the schoolhouse wall. There are two gates to the roadway. The school enclosure was built so near to the sea that the people going that way cannot pass except through the school ground, and they break the wall for the purpose. It used to be a place for sheltering boats in —both boats of the natives and boats of strangers, and now they cannot save a boat at all. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",4
"5","4954. What do you pay for your little plot ?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",5
"6","—£1 of rent. That is not a big rent, if one had value for it. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",6
"7","4955. What area of ground have you with your house?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",7
"8","—I can plant two bushels of seed oats in it and a barrel of potatoes ; and I have to carry half of the soil I need to cover the sea-weed with which I manure the ground. The greatest depth in any two square yards of it is not 6 inches—the substratum being rock. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",8
"9","4956. But what do the other people generally complain of in Dunan? ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",9
"10","— I have nothing to say about these further than what is stated in the paper which was sent in for them, but they are fishermen altogether. It is as follows :",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",10
"11","—'Unto the Honourable the Royal Commissioners for the Highlands and Islands of Scotland: the following petition, from the crofter-fishing population resident at Dunan, humbly showeth the grievances they have to complain of. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",11
"12","First, the amount of ground they at present possess is insufficient to maintain the population for three months in the year. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",12
"13","Second, a part of land was taken from us some years ago to form another croft, for which rent is now paid, but no allowance has been made to us for it. Instead of a reduction being made on our rents, they were raised. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",13
"14","Third, There are as many cottars crowded on the land as there are crofters. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",14
"15","Fourth, We have to buy all the sea-ware we put on our land from the large tenant farmers. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",15
"16","Fifth, The ground is so poor that there hasn't been a stone of meal made from all the corn grown on it for the last twenty years. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",16
"17","Sixth,That there is no place of refuge for our fishing boats.",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",17
"18","4957. Do the large farmers charge money for seaweed?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",18
"19","—Yes ; we always pay for the sea-weed, but we have not paid for this year's sea-weed yet. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",19
"20","4958. Are the farmers severe in exacting the payment, or do they let you off sometimes?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",20
"21","—Sometimes they let us off without payment. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",21
"22","4959. You say you complain of having no pier or harbour. Is there a suitable place for building a pier or harbour ?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",22
"23","—I know of no place about more capable of it. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",23
"24","4960. Sheriff Nicolson.",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",24
"25","—Is the sea opposite one of the best places for herring all about Skye?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",25
"26","—Branches of it. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",26
"27","4961. The Chairman.",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",27
"28","—Could a pier be easily built?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",28
"29","—Yes, the most convenient place about for the purpose. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",29
"30","4962. What sort of pier do you want,",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",30
"31","—merely a straight jetty out into the sea, or a quay along shore?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",31
"32","—A quay extending out, and a breakwater at the end. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",32
"33","4963. How far would it run into the sea?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",33
"34","—About 50 yards would do, or maybe less than that. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",34
"35","4964. Did you make a good fishing last year?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",35
"36","—Yes, but I lost my nets at Loch Hourn; and I was only three nights at that fishing. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",36
"37","4965. How did you lose your nets ?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",37
"38","—I took too much herring. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",38
"39","4966. Have you anything more to say ?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",39
"40","—There is a burn between us and the neighbouring township, and when the burn is in flood it is very dangerous for the children in the neighbouring township to cross to school. Their parents must meet them coming or going; and when the school skails, I cannot tell how many tracks they have through my cultivated land, ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",40
"41","4967. Could you put up a foot bridge over the burn?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",41
"42","—Yes. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",42
"43","4968. Did you ever ask the factor?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",43
"44","—Yes. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",44
"45","4969. What did he say ?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",45
"46","—The factor granted us wood for the purpose, and the people were not able even to bring wood to the place or to erect the bridge. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",46
"47","4970. Why ?",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",47
"48","—Because they can only get from the factor heavy trees to span the burn, and they have to lay stobs across this, and cover them with earth. ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",48
"49","4971. Did you really try to bring the wood, or were you idle about it? ",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",49
"50","—We were both idle and lazy about it. We are not complaining.",92,"Kenneth Mcrae","Skye, Broadford",50
