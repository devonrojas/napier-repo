"87","24751. What became of your husband ; was he in good health at the time he left the farm ?",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",87
"88","—No, not very. It is fourteen years since he was in good health—there has not been a year in that time he has been in good health. During the last two years he has been entirely unable to earn a sixpence.",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",88

"95","24755. Does he help his mother in the management of her croft?",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",95

"97","24756. And are you living with the mother now?",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",97
"98","—Yes, my husband's mother and sister are living in a room in the end of our house.",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",98
"99","24757. Are they able to earn anything?",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",99
"100","—Not the mother, but the sister is.",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",100
"101","24758. Are you able to earn anything?",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",101
"102","—I have a small family and cannot get out to work if I were able; my youngest child is an infant.",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",102
"103","24759. What is your particular complaint at this moment? Is it that you are not allowed to remain in the holding which your husband got?",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",103
"104","—Yes, and we are entirely destitute and have been applying for relief and none has been granted.",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",104

"110","—I was at the inspector of poor but not before the board. ",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",110
"111","24763. W hat reason did the inspector give you for not granting relief?",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",111
"112","—The General was not at home, and he said he would write the General and give me an answer. The answer did not come and my husband sent a note to the inspector, and the inspector said he called a meeting of the Parochial Board and the case was laid down and that unless he got a certificate from the medical officer of the parish that my husband was quite unable to work there would be no relief granted. He also said that if relief was granted my husband would find it in the poor-house in Kirkwall.",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",112
"113","24761. Did your husband get the certificate ?",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",113
"114","—He has not got it yet.",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",114
"115","24765. How was your husband able to pay for going to the Infirmary in Edinburgh?",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",115
"116","—His mother helped him.",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",116
"117","24766. Did any one else help him?",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",117

"120","— I went to the inspector of poor.",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",120
"121","24768. But have you applied to the proprietor for any other land or any support or assistance at all?",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",121
"122","—They always promised to give us the first place that was open, but now it is of no use as we have nothing to take any place with.",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",122
"123","24769. How long was your husband in the Infirmary?",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",123
"124","—I cannot exactly say; it is six weeks since he went to Edinburgh and he came back last Saturday night",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",124
"125","24770. Have they done him a great deal of good?",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",125

"147","—Why did your husband not get a medical certificate?",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",147
"148","—Dr Gibson the medical officer, told him that he could have given him a line that he was unable to work at the present time, but that if he was to go into the poor-house and be examined, the statement by the doctor in the poor-house might not agree with his, and that would hurt him (Dr Gibson) in his situation. Dr Gibson promised before to give my husband a line, and I thought I had nothing to do but go and get it; but when I mentioned about the poor-house, that was his statement, and Dr Stewart of Kirkwall offered my husband a line.",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",148

"155","24783. The Chairman.",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",155
"156","—Would you go to the poor-house?",416,"Georgina Inkster","Orkney, Kirkwall",156
