"1","FINLAY MACKAY, Crofter, Drynie Park, Mulbuie (30)—examined.",684,"Finlay Mackay","Ross-shire, Dingwall",1
"2","40891. The Chairman.",684,"Finlay Mackay","Ross-shire, Dingwall",2
"3","—Read your statement?",684,"Finlay Mackay","Ross-shire, Dingwall",3
"4","—I, Finlay Mackay, Drynie Park, Mulbuie, am appointed delegate for this district. The place was first colonised about the year 1834, when a general clearance in Strathconou under gross circumstances sent the people adrift, and a number of them, my late father among the rest, settled here. The people got the land in lots of from six to eighteen acres. The land was under wood previously, so that the roots along with an enormous quantity of stones made the land very difficult to reclaim. For the first seven years they had the land at Is. 3d. per acre, for the next seven years at 2s. 6d., and for the next seven years at 5s. A nineteen years' lease was then given at 10s. an acre, and it expired in 1876. The rent was then raised to 15s., which was about the time our present proprietor came into possession, No lease was given, and the rise of rent was laid upon our own improvements. Most of the houses built at first have been rebuilt, and no help whatever was given by the proprietor till the present year, when some of the tenants got a few trees. The ground is very light and of the poorest kind, the return of oats not being over 2½. There is only one well on this part of the estate that will last the whole year, and it will do for only one croft when the season is dry. I have to cart water about a mile for cattle, as well as for household use, during six months of the year. Those having no horse have to carry it in pails a great distance. Our chief complaint is that our rents have been raised too much on our own improvements, and what we want is a fair rent, fixity of  tenure, and compensation for our improvements.",684,"Finlay Mackay","Ross-shire, Dingwall",4
"5","40892. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",684,"Finlay Mackay","Ross-shire, Dingwall",5

"9","—No, we have not got a lease.",684,"Finlay Mackay","Ross-shire, Dingwall",9
"10","40894. But you are paying now 15s. an acre for ths land at Drynie Park ?",684,"Finlay Mackay","Ross-shire, Dingwall",10
"11","—Yes.",684,"Finlay Mackay","Ross-shire, Dingwall",11

"17","—Yes; those that had two acres improved got a reduction.",684,"Finlay Mackay","Ross-shire, Dingwall",17
"18","40898. Do you consider that 15s. an acre is too high a rent after fifty years' possession ?",684,"Finlay Mackay","Ross-shire, Dingwall",18
"19","—Yes, by one-third.",684,"Finlay Mackay","Ross-shire, Dingwall",19
"20","40899. What would the land be worth to any one going into it?",684,"Finlay Mackay","Ross-shire, Dingwall",20

"51","40914. How many were turned out of it?",684,"Finlay Mackay","Ross-shire, Dingwall",51
"52","—There were twenty-one turned out of one township,",684,"Finlay Mackay","Ross-shire, Dingwall",52
"53","40915. Was that the township your father belonged to?",684,"Finlay Mackay","Ross-shire, Dingwall",53
