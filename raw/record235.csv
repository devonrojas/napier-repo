"2","13216. The Chairman.",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected by the people?",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",3
"4","-Time was so short that there was no meeting of the people. It was Mr Davidson who mentioned it to me.",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",4
"5","13217. Have you any statement to make to the Commission?",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",5
"6","—I can add a little more to what the previous witness said. I was there when there were only eight tenants in Geocrab.",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",6
"7","13218. How long ago is that?",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",7
"8","—Before my father's time there were no people there at all. No person can conceive what kind of a place it is without seeing it. There is no highway there for cart nor horse. I was born there.",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",8
"9","13219. When you remember at first were the lands held on the runrig system, or were they already divided into lots ?",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",9
"10","—They had it among them in common. They had no lots among them, but the hill was divided into four parts, each of which was divided between two.",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",10
"11","13220. Was the arable ground divided every year-or every three years ?",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",11
"12","—Every year.",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",12
"13","13221. Was that a better system than the system of making separate lots, or is it better in lots ?",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",13

"27","13228. Who divided the lots of the arable ground every year? Was it the people themselves or the ground officer ?",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",27
"28","—The tenants made the division themselves. When people were removed from Rodel, that was the first thing that spoiled us. There were twenty-four tenants there. Three of them were sent iu among us, and the rent was not changed, and these people paying their own additional rents.",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",28
"29","13229. Sheriff Nicolson.",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",29

"53","—It is they that would. In those times they would sing and dance, and have tunes.",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",53
"54","13241. Was there any particular song or rhyme that they used to repeat at the time they started ?",235,"Donald Morrison","Harris, Obe",54
