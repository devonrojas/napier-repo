"1","JAMES WILLIAM BRUCE, Mason, son of a Crofter in Ballista (43)—examined.",361,"James William Bruce","Unst, Baltasound",1

"3","20491. The Chairman.",361,"James William Bruce","Unst, Baltasound",3
"4","—What statement have you to make? ",361,"James William Bruce","Unst, Baltasound",4
"5","—I beg respectfully to make the following statement on behalf of my father, who has occupied the farm on which we live since 1839, and in so doing will crave that protection from after consequences which the crofters in the Western Islands asked and received :",361,"James William Bruce","Unst, Baltasound",5
"6","—In the year 1839 the rent of the farm which my father then and still occupies was £4, 12s. We had then the right to the scat-holds for our sheep, cattle, and ponies, with six or seven acres, part of it meadow grass, the value of which when made into hay would be from 20s. to 25s. This continued up to 1867 or '68, when the proprietor leased his lands to a company of merchants, and then the scatholds were taken from the tenants. My father then had to pay this company some 30s. for right to graze his animals on the scathold, and about the same time the proprietor also deprived him of the right to the meadow. When the company broke up in 1876, and the farms were again in the hands of the proprietor, the same rent was exacted as he had been paying to this company, notwithstanding the loss of scathold and meadow grass. The present rent is over £7. The dwelling-house was in disrepair, the walls being in a bad condition, as also the roof; and the proprietor, at my father's suggestion, repaired the walls and put on a slate roof; formerly it was thatch. My father, according to agreement, paid £5, and was further to pay a pound yearly for twelve years. That time has elapsed, and still we are paying this pound, which we consider a great grievance. My father's rent, as I have already stated, was in 1839 £4, 12s., with right to graze as many animals as he liked, and meadow land which yielded from twenty to twenty-five loads of hay. Now the rent is over £7 and he has neither scathold nor meadow grass. When I spoke a year or two ago to the proprietor about the hardship entailed on my father by the loss of the commonty and meadow land, he told me he would make inquiry; but the rent is still the same, and will apparently continue to the end of the chapter. So that the rent since 1839 has been nearly doubled, besides the loss of scathold and meadow grass, which may be calculated at something like 50s. This is the statement I wish to make on behalf of my father, and I have no doubt that a great many tenants have a similar tale to tell if they would only come forward. If the Commissioners wish to ask me any questions I will be glad to answer them as far as lies in my power.",361,"James William Bruce","Unst, Baltasound",6
