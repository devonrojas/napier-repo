"1","DUGALD M’INTYRE, Farmer, Frackersaig (41)—examined.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",1
"2","37159. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",2
"3","—You are ground officer as well as a farmer?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",3
"4","—Yes. ",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",4
"5","37160. I see your name in the list of delegates; were you present at the meeting ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",5
"6","—I was present, but I only knew this morning my name was entered as a delegate.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",6
"7","37161. Who told you?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",7
"8","—Mr Livingston told me this morning.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",8
"9","37162. I suppose you are not prepared with any statement if you were",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",9
"10","not told ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",10
"11","—I have no statement on paper, but I shall be glad to answer any questions.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",11
"12","37163. You were present at the meeting?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",12
"13","—I was present at the first meeting, but there was a second meeting at which I was not present.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",13
"14","37164. Did they at that meeting discuss any complaints which they should make to the Commission ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",14
"15","—No, it was at the next meeting they did so.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",15
"16","37165. Do you think the people of Lismore have reason to complain of their treatment by the proprietors ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",16
"17","—Well, I do not believe they have so much reason at present as they had some time ago.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",17
"18","37166. What is their principal cause of complaint at the present time?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",18
"19","—I believe that the principal cause is bad houses. They complain of high rents, and no doubt the place is very highly rented. In these good years, when there are good prices for stock, there is not so much complaint; but when the prices of stock fall they have reason to complain then.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",19
"20","37167. What size of farm do you hold ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",20
"21","—About 400 acres.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",21
"22","37168. Of arable ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",22
"23","—No.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",23
"24","37169. How much is arable?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",24
"25","—Perhaps about one-sixth of it, including rocks and bogs, and waste land.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",25
"26","37170. Are your houses not satisfactory?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",26
"27","—Mine are; I have new houses.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",27
"28","37171. On what principle were they erected ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",28
"29","—I did part of the work myself and the proprietor did the rest. I was near about the half and the proprietor the other half.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",29
"30","37172. Are you bound to maintain them?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",30
"31","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",31
"32","37173. Have you a lease?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",32
"33","—Yes, I had a nineteen years' lease, and I have now a renewal of the lease for the same period. I had a nineteen years' lease when I built the houses.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",33
"34","37174. And you have nineteen years more ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",34
"35","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",35
"36","37175. Are the houses generally very bad here?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",36
"37","—Most of them are very bad.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",37
"38","37176. Do the people themselves complain of them?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",38
"39","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",39
"40","37177. Would they erect better houses for themselves if they got leases ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",40
"41","—I believe they would.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",41
"42","37178. On the same footing as you have erected yours ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",42
"43","—Most of them would.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",43
"44","37179. Are leases refused to them ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",44
"45","—No.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",45
"46","37180. Why do they not receive them?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",46
"47","—Some of the small crofters do not care for it, because they consider it too much expense in drawing out a lease.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",47
"48","37181. The cost of the lease prevents them taking it?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",48
"49","—Yes, some of them.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",49
"50","37182. And yet you think if they had leases they would improve their houses ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",50
"51","—No doubt, it would be an encouragement.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",51
"52","37183. In what way do you estimate the rent of lands in Lismore; is it in relation to the stock or acreage ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",52
"53","—It is in relation to the stock.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",53
"54","37184. What do you put upon a cow ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",54
"55","—A cow's rent generally is from £3, 10s. to £5.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",55
"56","37185. That is winter and summer keep?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",56
"57","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",57
"58","37186. And that includes one follower?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",58
"59","—No, that would not take any follower, nothing but the milk calves.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",59
"60","37187. And what do you put on the followers—year-olds and two-year olds?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",60
"61","—About £2, 5s. in the year; sometimes we require to make a little provision if the winter comes severe.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",61
"62","37188. In offering for a farm that is how you would offer —in that form ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",62
"63","—We know the farms, and do not very often calculate upon the stock.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",63
"64","37189. Do you sell grain here ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",64
"65","—Very little.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",65
"66","37190. Potatoes ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",66
"67","—Some potatoes some years.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",67
"68","37191. Your principal sales of produce are cattle ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",68
"69","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",69
"70","37192. And sheep?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",70
"71","—Yes, on the large farms, but not the small ones.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",71
"72","37193. Have you a stock of sheep?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",72
"73","—Yes, a mixed stock of sheep and cattle.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",73
"74","37194. What rent is paid for sheep grazing ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",74
"75","—Fifteen shillings for some of the half-bred sheep.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",75
"76","37195. Are they all half-bred sheep here ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",76
"77","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",77
"78","37196. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",78
"79","—Have you heard what has been stated here to-day ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",79
"80","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",80
"81","37197. Do you know most of the people who spoke ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",81
"82","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",82
"83","37198. Do you think they represent the feelings of the class they belong to ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",83
"84","—I have no doubt, some of them perhaps have gone a little too far.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",84
"85","37199. Are you a native of the island yourself?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",85
"86","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",86
"87","37200. And have been here all your days ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",87
"88","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",88
"89","37201. You stated in the beginning to Sir Kenneth Mackenzie that they have not now so much to complain of as they might have had, do you recollect what has been stated in the case of the Cheyne evictions ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",89
"90","—Yes, I remember some of them. My father was a tenant on that estate.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",90
"91","37202. Would you say that these evictions were unreasonable in every way ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",91
"92","—I believe they were.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",92
"93","37203. Upon the two estates that you are acting as ground officer for have you any special instructions on the part of the proprietor except to look after matters in the ordinary way a ground officer has?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",93
"94","—No..",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",94
"95","37204. You have no special instructions ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",95
"96","—No.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",96
"97","37205. Do you allow the people under you as much of their own way as is consistent with what is right ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",97
"98","—I give them almost altogether their own way.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",98
"99","37206. The Chairman.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",99
"100","—We have not seen much of the island, but as we drove along here I was much struck by the inferior character of the dwelling-houses of the farmers with regard to the amount of rent that they paid. I was told, for instance, there were farms there paying from £30 to £100 of rent, and the houses seemed little better than Highland crofters' houses. Do you think it would be possible for the proprietors to give some encouragement to better the buildings both for the lodging of people and stock?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",100
"101","—Yes, some of the proprietors are encouraging the tenants. Mr Fell has put up a good many new buildings on his estate, and he is intending to put some up this year.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",101
"102","37207. On what system is that done; if the proprietor makes the whole outlay, what interest is charged to the tenant ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",102
"103","—I believe he charges 6½  per cent. I do not pay any interest.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",103
"104","37208. When the tenant and proprietor co-operate and pay each a half, then we were told that at the end of the occupancy the depreciation on the whole was valued to the tenant, and he had to pay for the depreciation",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",104
"105","on what he had himself paid for ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",105
"106","—No, that is only deficiency upon the houses; if they are neglected to be properly looked after, there is then deficiency charged upon the outgoing tenant, but no depreciation during the time he is in occupation.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",106
"107","37209. You mean that they pay then only for culpable neglect ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",107
"108","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",108
"109","37210. Or abuse of the buildings ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",109
"110","— Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",110
"111","37211. Are there any cases in which a tenant goes to the whole expense of the buildings ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",111
"112","—I am not aware that there is at present.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",112
"113","37212. Neither on the dwelling-houses nor on the farm offices?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",113
"114","—Not at present that I am aware of ; but about twenty-five years ago my father built upon the late Mr Cheyne's estate upon his own account entirely. He had no lease, but he had the promise of not being removed.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",114
"115","37213. Would he have been held liable at the end of the lease for the depreciation of the offices which he had entirely built himself ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",115
"116","—He was just charged deficiency upon the houses for anything that they require at the time to put them in proper order; not to put them like what they were when new, but he had to make a payment on account of depreciation of offices, the whole of which he had built himself.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",116
"117","37214. Do you mean depreciation or deficiency ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",117
"118","—It is deficiency, disrepair.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",118
"119","37215. But still in connection with buildings the whole of which he had erected himself ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",119
"120","—Yes. These were thatched houses.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",120
"121","37216. But had he to pay for any defect in the buildings instead of the proprietor paying him for the improvement he had made ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",121
"122","—Yes, and he was turned out of the farm against his will.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",122
"123","37217. About the stock in the hands of the smaller tenants, do you think the stock would be susceptible of improvement, could they bring up better description than they do ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",123
"124","—I don't think so. I think the stock are very suitable for the small crofts, the stock they have.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",124
"125","37218. They have not any shorthorn cross ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",125
"126","—No.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",126
"127","37219. You don't think they could maintain that description of stock ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",127
"128","—No, they would be too heavy for the crofts here; too expensive for wintering.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",128
"129","37220. We heard from a previous witness that there was a great diminution of the population, which he ascribed to the discouragement to marriage which the condition of the island was supposed to offer, what do you think of that ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",129
"130","—I cannot say anything in regard to that. The only thing I can say is, that if they got married they have no houses to take up in.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",130
"131","37221. What becomes of the younger members of the families generally ; do they emigrate permanently to the south or the colonies ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",131
"132","—They generally go to the south to service.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",132
"133","37222. And remain away ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",133
"134","—Most of them do. Sometimes they come back.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",134
"135","37223. Has there been any emigration from the island to America or Australia ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",135
"136","—There was a good deal of emigration to America ; but they emigrated with their own free will.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",136
"137","37224. And have they done well in America?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",137
"138","—Some of them have done pretty well.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",138
"139","37225. Do they maintain any correspondence with their relatives here ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",139
"140","—Yes, there were some of them back to this country a few years ago.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",140
"141","37226. And did they give encouragement to their friends to emigrate ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",141
"142","—Some of them did, and others did not.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",142
"143","37227. Is there any great reluctance or repugnance to the idea of emigration, or if a man could afford it would he be generally glad to go ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",143
"144","—I could not say. I know they have a feeling for their native country, to stay in it if they can.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",144
"145","37228. Professor Mackinnon.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",145
"146","—Do you think the small crofts are relatively rented about as high as farms of over £100 or about that ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",146
"147","—I think they are fully as high as the large farms.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",147
"148","37229. And what one would call a small farm—£50 to £100 : I see by the valuation roll there is a considerable number of these in the island—are these fully as highly rented as the larger farms, of which there are only two or three ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",148
"149","—Just something about what the larger farms are.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",149
"150","37230. But you think the small crofts, relative to their size and worth, are about as highly rented or more so than the big farms ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",150
"151","—That is my idea. I know that the best part of the land is laid out waste under sheep. The Duke of Argyll's estate is the best part of the island.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",151
"152","37231. That farm is very large ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",152
"153","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",153
"154","37232. About £1400 rent ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",154
"155","— Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",155
"156","37233. In that case, looking to the circumstances of the people here, supposing there was an inclination to split up a large farm, there would be quite a reasonable expectation that as much rent could be had for it after",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",156
"157","it was divided into crofts ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",157
"158","—Yes ; there is a good number of the small farmers able to take larger holdings if they got an opening.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",158
"159","37234. And some of the crofters might then take the place of the farmers, and some of the cottars could take the place of the crofters ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",159
"160","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",160
"161","37235. The people upon the east end of the place, Port Ramsay, complained that their rents were too high because the place was so bad; is it worse generally than the rest of the island ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",161
"162","—It is about the worst part of land in the island. There are some spots very good, but upon the whole it is the worst.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",162
"163","37236. The land is so very good over the whole of the island that it can afford to pay a high rent ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",163
"164","—It is pretty highly rented.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",164
"165","37237. You think it is fully rented all over ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",165
"166","—I believe it is.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",166
"167","37238. With regard to the quarry in which so many people are able to obtain work, I hope you do not lose yourself by providing for so many of the people who could not be otherwise provided for ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",167
"168","—Sometimes I am only too glad to get hold of them, as I cannot carry on work without them but in the busiest time, when I need them most, I cannot get them ; they have their own work to do. ",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",168
"169","37239. Is there difficulty in getting cottars when labour pays so well; do you think there would be more population in the place if it was easier to get a cottage ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",169
"170","—I believe there would.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",170
"171","37240. A man from Killean rather stated there was a large number living there without land or a cow Ì I suppose it is quite the case ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",171
"172","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",172
"173","37241. And he said that in the surrounding district there was not a sufficient supply of milk for people of that class ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",173
"174","—That is on account of the land being put in large farms.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",174
"175","37242. If there were more substantial crofters round about the cottars could get milk for payment ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",175
"176","—Yes; and tenants could get work done cheaper than they can at present.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",176
"177","37243. But the want of population all over the place makes the rate of wages pretty high ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",177
"178","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",178
"179","37244. Is it higher than in the surrounding districts upon the mainland?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",179
"180","—It is higher than in some parts.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",180
"181","37245. The rate of wages is from 18s. to 20s. a week?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",181
"182","—Well, I employ some of my men at 17s. a week ; new hands not well up to their work—17s. to 19s. a week.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",182
"183","37246. The state of affairs one of the delegates spoke to with respect to houses evidently does not exist now ; nobody builds houses entirely at his own charge ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",183
"184","—Not just now, but I believe they used to do some time ago.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",184
"185","37247. As I understood, the case of your father was this ; he built the steadings at his own expense entirely; he was then evicted, and he was charged for putting the dwellings into what one would call a tenantable condition for his successor ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",185
"186","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",186
"187","37248. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",187
"188","—Perhaps there was no successor ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",188
"189","—Yes, there was another tenant. My father offered, but this tenant offered a few pounds more, and got it.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",189
"190","37249. Professor Mackinnon.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",190
"191","—Looking to the fertility of the place, the soil, and the general circumstances of the people all over, and supposing there was an intention to break up one of those big farms into smaller holdings, what size of holding do you think would be the most suitable in this island to break them up into ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",191
"192","— I know upon this estate, where there are no houses at present, it would be very expensive for the proprietor to put new houses upon smaller holdings, and I think from £50 to £100 would be the smallest he could afford to make.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",192
"193","37250. Except with regard to the houses, there would be no difficulty in getting the same rent even supposing they were made into smaller holdings?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",193
"194","—No.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",194
"195","37251. But you think making them into places from £50 to £100, houses could be erected and tenants got, and that tenants from a lower stratum would be got for the holdings which would become vacant ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",195
"196","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",196
"197","37252. There are plenty of men and capital in Lismore to take up readjusted holdings ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",197
"198","—Yes, but not the whole.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",198
"199","37253. And you believe the place would keep more men, and upon the whole fully as well off as they are at present ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",199
"200","—I believe it would.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",200
"201","37254. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",201
"202","—A farm of £100 would require hired labour ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",202
"203","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",203
"204","37255. What size of farm could be worked by a family without hired labour ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",204
"205","—A farm of from £50 to £70.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",205
"206","37256. The Chairman.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",206
"207","—What do you think a fair rent for average arable ground per annum ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",207
"208","—I believe the arable ground in some parts is up to 30s. an acre, but not taking it on an average all over. There is a great deal of waste land and rocks and so on.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",208
"209","37257. Sheriff Nicolson.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",209
"210","—There is no public-house in this island ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",210
"211","—None at present.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",211
"212","37258. How long since?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",212
"213","—About seven or eight years.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",213
"214","37259. Did there use to be always one?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",214
"215","—When I remember about thirty years ago there were five.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",215
"216","37260. Is it considered any grievance by the inhabitants to have none ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",216
"217","—Not that I am aware of. If it were they would have told us. It was at first, when the last public-house was done away with, but not now.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",217
"218","37261. Do you think it is any inconvenience to strangers?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",218
"219","—Not the want of a public-house; but I believe a temperance hotel would be better.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",219
"220","37262. How many policemen are there?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",220
"221","—None in the island, but there is one in the parish.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",221
"222","37263. Has a policeman ever to come to the island ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",222
"223","—Not very often—not since the public-house was done away with.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",223
"224","37264 Did he use to come oftener ?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",224
"225","—Yes, pretty often.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",225
"226","37265. Are the habits of the people generally quiet and correct?",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",226
"227","—Yes.",616,"Dugald Mcintyre","Argyll, Lismore",227
