"1","ALEXANDER MORRISON, Commission Merchant, Stornoway (29)—examined.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",1
"2","16425. The Chairman.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",2
"3","—You appear here on the behalf of the people of Stornoway?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",3
"4","—I appear on behalf of Bay Head and on behalf of the Stornoway branch of the Highland Lewis Land Reform Association. ",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",4
"5","The principal grievance which the Lewis people have got, in general with the whole of the West Highland crofters, is that any one buying an estate buys them, and has got the power of turning them out of their native soil, without compensation or anything else but sending them off. When a man buys the Lewis land and 26,000 people, he buys the rights and liberties of the people, with the right of turning them out; and it is the wish of these poor men that the right of eviction should be stopped entirely so long as they pay rents. The principal grievance also is that there are lots of land in Lewis to support from 60,000 to 70,000 people, and instead of that land being given to the crofters, it is wholly under deer and sheep farms, and let. These crofters are willing to pay a fair rent for that land if they only got it, and there is plenty of it for them. If any crofter is put into a bit of bog land, and reclaims that land with the sweat of his brow for thirty years, as the law exists at present, he does not get a cent for compensation for improvements, no matter how it goes, so far as I am led to understand. The Lewis people are overcrowded, and put down to the worst pieces of land, down to the sea-shore, and the best land in the island is under deer and sheep farms. They wished Lady Matheson to give this land at a fair rent, and subdivide it out to the tenants, for they were willing to pay, but they were refused ; and I understand they did not get it, and what they wish is that they humbly pray Her Majesty's Government that they would compel the proprietors to give them the land at a fair rent. There is no part of the west coast like the Lewis. They are the finest race of men we have got to recruit the army and the navy. The people are loyal subjects, and willing to fight for Her Majesty the Queen and their country, and it would be a pity to",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",5
"6","exterminate them all from their native soil for the sake of deer and sheep. I may further say they are not Revolutionists, Communists, or Socialists. They only want what is fair and just, and what they are willing to pay for. They are loyal subjects. There is a spirit of discontent all along the West Highlands at present; and unless the Government step in and make some concessions to the people by way of giving them the lands for which they are willing to pay, and fixity of tenure, they may be led to break the law, and a spirit of discontent may get up that no Government could put a stop to So it is the wish of the people that their grievances should be remedied, in order to put a stop to the system of oppression and slavery under which they are labouring at present",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",6
"7","16426. Mr Cameron.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",7
"8","—You state that the first and principal grievance of the people is, that when a proprietor buys an estate he buys the people with it, and has the power to evict them. Are you of opinion that that power has been largely or at all exercised within the last few years in the island of Lewis?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",8
"9","—I am certain that the people are more frightened of the proprietor and factor than they are of the God that created them.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",9
"10","16427. But I wish to know whether this fear of being evicted is wellfounded or not—whether it is founded upon experience ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",10
"11","—Those people and their forefathers occupied the sod for hundreds of years, and they consider it a case of hardship to be under the sway of any man who has it his power to exterminate them out of the land of their birth.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",11
"12","16428. But has the proprietor of the Lewis practically exterminated the people out of the land of their birth ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",12
"13","—In some districts of the Lewis they have been compelled to leave, and emigrate to foreign shores against their will.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",13
"14","16429. Will you state to what extent that was prevailed?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",14
"15","—They have been forced to leave parts of Uig against their will, and they have been forced to leave Ness and Galston, over at the Butt of Lewis, and they have been forced to leave other districts.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",15
"16","16430. You mean they were evicted, that they were simply turned off by the arbitrary will of the proprietor?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",16
"17","—In some districts they were, and in other districts they were put out to take bog land, and to commence reclaiming it again.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",17
"18","16431. When did these evictions take place?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",18
"19","—Some years ago ; I am not exactly sure.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",19
"20","16432. Have any evictions of that nature taken place within the last twenty years—I mean evictions in an arbitrary and wholesale manner, such as would naturally produce the effect to which you allude in your statement ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",20
"21","—I am not exactly sure as to twenty years, but I know it is within the last twenty or thirty years.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",21
"22","16433. Is it your opinion that Sir James and Lady Matheson have managed this property in such a manner as to create a bona fide fear that people who pay their rents and are well-conducted will be arbitrarily evicted?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",22
"23","—The 26,000 inhabitants of the island are principally people at the bidding and beck of one single individual, and it is to take the power from them by a proper measure being passed by Parliament, that it is the only hope and cure for a present state of matters.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",23
"24","16434. With regard to arrears, you say a law should be passed by which no crofter should be evicted so long as he paid his rent. Have you any idea what the arrears of rent on the island of Lewis are ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",24
"25","—I have no idea what they are.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",25
"26","16435. Have you any reason to believe they are very considerable?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",26
"27","—I cannot say.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",27
"28","16436. Supposing, for the sake of argument, that the arrears were very large, would not the effect of such a law as you indicate be that large numbers of the people under this law you suggest might be at once removed from the island of Lewis ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",28
"29","—We would have a clause in the Bill for that matter of it, that every man who had three or four or five years' rent to pay should be evicted. People don't want the land for nothing.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",29
"30","16437. Do you think the people under such a law would be more secure in their holdings than they are under the present management of the Lewis ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",30
"31","—Certainly I do.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",31
"32","16438. With the power given to the landlord to evict them if they were in arrears of rent ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",32
"33","—Provided there were three or four or five years' rent against them.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",33
"34","16439. Do you think, on any estate of the Highlands, a proprietor who wished to buy that estate for sporting and other purposes would not be more willing to purchase the estate under such a law as you suggest than under the present state of things, where the matter is left to the good feeling and generosity of the proprietor?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",34
"35","—As to that I cannot answer.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",35
"36","16440. Have you ever taken any means of comparing the value of Highland properties where there are crofters and where there are no crofters ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",36
"37","—No.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",37
"38","16441. Has it ever been brought under your notice that Highland property where there are no crofters very often fetches as much as fifty years' purchase?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",38
"39","—Well, it is a grievance of the people. It is the people's grievances we are talking about; it is not a matter of pounds, shillings, and pence. ",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",39
"40","16442. Then I only ask you a simple question. Have you ever studied the question of the value of Highland properties that are brought into the market ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",40
"41","—No.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",41
"42","16443. Do you believe if some of the Western Hebrides were now in the market, that they would find a purchaser at all ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",42
"43","—The Lewis, I am certain, would be sold. If the parties who are acting for the trustees, or whoever they are that the island belongs to at present, sold it, I am sure the whole crofters would go in for it, and buy it right off, if they got it at a moderate price. It would only cost about £7, 18s. a head, and give £10,000 more than was paid for it.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",43
"44","16444. I may assume that though you profess not to know that the crofters in the island are in arrears of rent, you in common with the public at large are aware that there are very large arrears of rent due by the crofters in the Western Islands ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",44
"45","—I was not aware of it. They are paid up here, so far as I know.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",45
"46","16445. Then do you not consider that if, instead of relying upon the kindly feeling which subsists between landlords and tenants, and under which wholesale evictions have not taken place, you were to pass a law by which you would destroy that kindly feeling, and enable any landlord to evict any tenant who owed him rent, it would be a very simple means of at once clearing a large portion of the Western Islands ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",46
"47","—What the people want is that they wish the Government to pass a law to put a stop for ever to eviction, and have fixity of tenure, and the land at a fair rent.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",47
"48","16446. But in your statement, you proposed that no evictions were to take place except for non-payment of rent ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",48
"49","—That was admitted before, that in the case of any crofter being three, four, or five years in arrears of rent, be should be evicted,—because they do not want the land for nothing. They want the land at a fair rent",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",49
"50","16447. Then you mean that, in addition to the law by which crofters are not to be evicted except for non-payment of rent, they are to be allowed to run a certain number of years in arrears of rent ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",50
"51","—Certainly, to give them a chance.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",51
"52","16448. And therefore the mere non-payment of rent would not form a ground or justification for the landlord to evict. It would require to be cumulative arrears?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",52
"53","—I said that in the event of four or five years' rent being against them, Government or the law would permit them to be evicted then; but not under four or five years, because they might have a few bad years, and might get into difficulties, but might pull up and pay it afterwards.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",53
"54","16449. So you would alter it, and say not that no crofters are to be evicted except for non-payment of rent, but except for non-payment of four or five years' rent. That is practically what you would have ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",54
"55","—Yes.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",55
"56","16450. You would also pass a law by which proprietors are to be compelled to give the crofters land at a fair rent, and I presume you mean some rent that would be fixed by an impartial person ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",56
"57","—Yes, or compel the parties to sell their estates to the people, the one or the other.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",57
"58","16451. Do you think that the kind of the Lewis, let out at what you call a fair rent, would fetch anything like the rent it brings now ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",58
"59","—I am sure it would. I am sure if the people got the land, and if they were certain that they would not be turned out, instead of the Lewis supporting 26,000 people in misery and poverty, as they exist at present, it would be able to support 60,000 or 70,000 people in plenty, and quite contented.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",59
"60","16452. And that the fair rent alluded to would be equal, taken on an aggregate, to the whole rental of the island of Lewis at present ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",60
"61","—Yes. They are not Communists or Socialists; they want to pay for what they get.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",61
"62","16453. That I quite believe, but what I am trying to get at is your own notion of the value of the rent, and you think that what you call a fair rent to be paid by the crofters, would be equal to the total rent now derived from the island of Lewis ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",62
"63","—Yes.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",63
"64","16454. Have you ever gone into the question, or made any calculations, or studied it, to enable you to give that answer, which, I must say, does not coincide with any of the previous evidence we have had from crofters or representatives of the island themselves?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",64
"65","—I have gone through every part of the island, and I know the best parts are under sheep and deer, and the worst patches are occupied by the crofters down at the sea-shore.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",65
"66","16455. We had it from one witness who lived on the spot, and might be supposed to know, that he considered the larger portion of the deer forest called Morsgiel, which is now let for £1000, would be to the crofters in his parish worth £40. You don't coincide with that?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",66
"67","—I don't see that the crofters could interfere much. They don't want to do away with the Game Laws in that way.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",67
"68","16456. But it has nothing to do with the Game Laws. What I meant was to try and ascertain from you upon what basis you founded your opinion that the land of the Lewis, if divided among the crofters, would produce the same rental as is now obtained under the present system ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",68
"69","—If all the large sheep runs and other farms and islands that are laid waste at present were given to the people. I say and maintain here, the rental would be quite as high as at present.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",69
"70","16457. But, taking the sheep farms and leaving out deer forests, because they may be considered, perhaps, as waste, why do you apply the word - waste ' to sheep farms ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",70
"71","—They produce mutton do they not ? Most of the land that is under sheep runs in the Lewis was at one time cultivated with the sweat of the brow and with the daily toil of the poor crofters, who had to work for the land, and never got compensation for improvements, and after it was taken into a state of  cultivation they were driven out, and sheep and deer put in their stead.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",71
"72","16458. That is not exactly an answer. I want to know why you apply the word ' waste' to land that is grazed by sheep—which are the produce of the land, the same as any other?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",72
"73","—Because it is waste. The country is getting wild, and the grass itself does not grow right, and the heather is coming to grow again.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",73
"74","16459. But on what proportion of the land which you say is waste could corn be grown ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",74
"75","—The finest portion of the land is over at Uig, and is laid waste, and over at Park, and several other large tracts of the country that are under sheep and deer, and the people down on the seashore.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",75
"76","16460. But I want to know what proportion of the land that is under sheep could be cultivated by the plough and be made to produce corn ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",76
"77","—A considerable proportion. I cannot give you a proper answer to that.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",77
"78","16461. Supposing crofters had this land, would they not be dependent upon the rearing of sheep in a far larger proportion, in the same way as the tacksmen are dependent upon sheep ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",78
"79","—The crofters want the arable land, and the moorland besides for their cattle and sheep, for which they are willing to pay.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",79
"80","16462. Sheriff Nicolson.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",80
"81","—In your estimate of the capacity of this island to support double its present population, have you calculated what quantity of land is necessary for crofters to possess in order to enable them to live upon it ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",81
"82","—I would consider six to ten acres of arable land, and the moorland in connection with the crofts. ",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",82
"83","16463. Have you estimated what ought to be a fair rent for that?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",83
"84","—No, I did not.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",84
"85","16464 I suppose you know the acreage of the island of Lewis?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",85
"86","—I do not know the acreage.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",86
"87","16465. Have you not made a calculation, on the above estimate of the number of acres that would support a crofter, to enable you to show that the island would support twice its present population?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",87
"88","—I have been calculating so many people. I have been thinking a great number could be put upon the sheep runs that are under one man. ",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",88
"89","16466. But that is a vague estimate. Unless you know the number of acres in the island, and have calculated exactly whether the acreage of the island would yield that number per croft which you consider necessary to support a population of 60,000, a mere vague statement is of small value to us. We want to ascertain facts, and we expect people who come and make these large and generous statements to have looked well into the statistics of the island, to know the number of acres that are arable, and the number that are fit for pasture, and to make a rational scheme for laying it out as they propose for the benefit of the people ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",89
"90","—There are vast districts in our island that are not occupied by the people at all, and in former years they used to have their crofts there, but now all these districts are under sheep and deer. Instead of supporting 26,000, it would support 70,000 or 80,000.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",90
"91","16467. But it is quite impossible to say that unless, with the knowledge of the number of acres in the island, you can apportion it among the population fairly. Would you be surprised if it were discovered from the statistics of the island, that it could not give anything like the number of acres you think of land fit to be lived upon?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",91
"92","—I know the districts",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",92
"93","16468. But you do not know the number of acres and the value of the acres ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",93
"94","—I do not know at the present time.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",94
"95","16469. But it is necessary to know that in order to speak for the whole island and the whole population of the island. Then, supposing the island were so distributed among the whole population, each of them having as much of the land as you think necessary for them to live upon comfortably, what provision would you then make to prevent the reduction of the quantity of land occupied by those people, because the population, of course, would go on increasing ? What provision would you make to prevent the subdivision of the land ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",95
"96","—At present the people are ignorant, and the majority of them cannot even talk the English language, and the system that would be suitable for them at present would not be required in a few years, because when their children are educated and have a knowledge of the world, they would not condescend to wait upon their present crofts. But our people at present are not in a position to pick themselves up in the Colonies. They are not educated, they have not got the English language, and in every way they would be an unsuitable lot to send away to the Colonies.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",96
"97","16470. Do you mean to say that the majority of the people of Lewis, who are among the best peasantry in the West of Scotland, are not good subjects for emigration, to be sent to a suitable colony, merely because they do not speak first-rate English ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",97
"98","—I say no, that they will be far better under present circumstances, when they have the sea to fall back upon as well as the land, and that they never would",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",98
"99","be as comfortable in any part of the land as they would be in the Lewis.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",99
"100","16471. Are you aware then that all the people who have emigrated within the memory of man from Lewis to all parts of the world are living worse than they would be at home ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",100
"101","—I am aware that a considerable number of those who were evicted and exterminated out of the land of their birth were in a worse plight in the country of their adoption than they were in their old country.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",101
"102","16472. From what source have you derived your information on this subject ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",102
"103","—From various letters and information which have come.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",103
"104","16473. There was some emigration in Sir James Matheson's time?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",104
"105","—Yes.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",105
"106","16474. Was it to any considerable extent?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",106
"107","—No.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",107
"108","16475. Was that voluntary, or forced?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",108
"109","—So far as I know, they were compelled to go.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",109
"110","16476. On what account?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",110
"111","—Why, in the Lewis, if the people are deprived of their land they must go somewhere. It is as well for them to leave the country altogether.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",111
"112","16477. Do you mean that Sir James Matheson sent them away against their will ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",112
"113","—They were deprived of their lands against their will.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",113
"114","16478. Was that not because they could not or would not pay their rents ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",114
"115","—They were willing and able to pay, and they are so still.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",115
"116","16479. Are you quite sure that those people who emigrated in Sir James Matheson's time were not in arrears?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",116
"117","—I am certain of it.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",117
"118","16480. All of them?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",118
"119","—I am not certain of the whole of them; but I know the majority were the same as at present. And there was no reduction made of the rent this season when the crops were an entire failure, and every proprietor along the coast gave a reduction; our proprietor gave no reduction at all.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",119
"120","16481. Do you know what was the rent when Sir James Matheson bought this property ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",120
"121","—No.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",121
"122","16482. Do you know what it is now ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",122
"123","—About £23,000 or £24,000, I believe.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",123
"124","16483. Do you know, in point of fact, whether Sir James Matheson greatly increased the rental since he bought the estate?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",124
"125","—I know he did.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",125
"126","16484. To what extent do you know?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",126
"127","—To a considerable extent. I know the whole crofter and fishing population would buy the island if they got it at a fair price; and £15,000 or £20,000 more than he paid for it.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",127
"128","16485. How have you ascertained that?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",128
"129","—Through coming in contact with the people all over the island.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",129
"130","16486. But you have already said, though I must take the liberty of doubting the accuracy of the statement, that the people of Lewis are in a state of poverty and misery. There may be many, and too many, in that condition, but do you adhere to the statement that the majority of the people of this island are in a state of misery ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",130
"131","—I do—poverty and misery.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",131
"132","16487. Is that consistent with the fact that a great many of their houses which we have seen are among the best houses we have seen in the Western Islands, that their land appeared to us to be as good land —such as there was of it;—as we had seen in some other places, and the people themselves as well and tidily dressed as we had seen in other places ? We saw that on a considerable scale in several parts of the island. Is that consistent with the fact that the people to whom those houses belong are in a state of poverty and misery ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",132
"133","—The people would build better houses and reclaim the land and have everything in order if they had fixity of tenure. ",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",133
"134","16488. That is scarcely an answer. Do you say that a man is in a state of poverty and misery who has a house and a piecehouse and a piece of land at a moderate rent—paying £2 or £ 3 for it, on which he manages to keep two cows and a few sheep ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",134
"135","—I say that taking them as class altogether, they are in a state of misery and poverty.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",135
"136","16189. Are you aware that in the island of Skye, where we have been, we have found people paying rents treble those of, I believe, the majority of the crofters in this island, and who are not able to keep half the same number of cows, and some of them no cows at all ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",136
"137","—Yes, I am aware that the evil is wide-spread all over the Western Islands.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",137
"138","16490. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",138
"139","—You hold some office here connected with the reform of the land laws ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",139
"140","—Yes, I do.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",140
"141","16491. In what manner were you elected?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",141
"142","—I was elected by the free will of a number of the Stornoway people.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",142
"143","16492. Was there a large number present?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",143
"144","—There was a considerable number present",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",144
"145","16493. There was a meeting here last week, or a fortnight ago?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",145
"146","—There was a meeting here last week.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",146
"147","16494. Did you take any part in it?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",147
"148","—Yes, I did.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",148
"149","16495. Was the meeting unanimous?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",149
"150","—So far as I could see, it was.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",150
"151","16496. How many might there have been present?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",151
"152","—According to my calculation I fancy there would be about 4000 people present.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",152
"153","16497. I presume you are a native of the island?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",153
"154","—Yes.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",154
"155","16498. You have been here all your life, off and on?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",155
"156","—Yes, and I have been out of it for a good bit too sometimes,—for six or twelve months.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",156
"157","16499. Where were you when you were away generally?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",157
"158","—I have been about Scotland and over England.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",158
"159","16500. Have you been abroad ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",159
"160","—No.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",160
"161","16501. You stated you were pretty well acquainted with the island all over, and have travelled a good part of it, and your means of knowledge therefore, I presume, are pretty considerable ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",161
"162","—Certainly.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",162
"163","16502. You have been questioned about the removals of the people. Am I accurate in stating that removals may be of two classes—that is, a complete extermination out of the country, and also a shifting of them from one place to another ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",163
"164","—Yes, we have both of these systems here,",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",164
"165","16503. In fact, they vary considerably; but still I presume they are never for the benefit of the person who is removed?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",165
"166","—It always tells against the person who is removed.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",166
"167","16504. You state you have no objection that, in the event of their not paying arrears for four or five years, there should be the power of eviction. When you speak of the arrears, do I understand you don't mean arrears in the present circumstances, but under the new system of fair rent ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",167
"168","—Under the new system of fair rent.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",168
"169","16505. You also made a statement about sale. You think the people are very anxious to become proprietors of their own ground?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",169
"170","—Yes, rather than remain under the present state of existence in which they are.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",170
"171","16506. In your travels all over the island, though you are not able to condescend upon the number of acres that are now waste, but formerly cultivated, are you not satisfied there are a very large number of acres—particularly in Uig—that are now unturned by the plough ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",171
"172","—A considerable portion of the Lewis islands are laid waste in that way.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",172
"173","16507. Are you aware that in former times the crofters generally supported their families out of the produce of the croft—that they had their food out of it and their clothing? ",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",173
"174","—I am aware they combined that they fished at sea and worked on land besides.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",174
"175","16508. And made their clothes to a certain extent out of the wool ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",175
"176","—To a certain extent they might have done so.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",176
"177","16509. Is it not a fact that in all the removals that have taken place, it is out of the best lands that the people have been put and crowded into places that it was not worth while for the big farmer to take ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",177
"178","—Yes, they have been driven out of the best portions of the Lewis, and driven down to the most barren places—the same as they were driven out of Park and put in upon Crossbost, a place which they reclaimed with the sweat of their brows, and nothing at all for their labour.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",178
"179","16510. We have been informed in several places that we have visited in the north of the island, that the crofters have a very large proportion of hill pasture; but is it not a fact that the pasture generally is of a very inferior class ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",179
"180","—Yes, it is.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",180
"181","16511. So if a man had an out-run of 500 or 1000 acres it might be of very little value indeed ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",181
"182","—Very little indeed.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",182
"183","16512. Whereas in the case of a farmer with a similar out-run elsewhere, it might be worth a very great deal more ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",183
"184","—Certainly.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",184
"185","16513. You were asked also about the expenditure which the late Sir James Matheson had made upon the estate. I suppose there is no doubt of that ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",185
"186","—He never expended any money upon crofters.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",186
"187","16514. We are coming to that, but let justice be done. There was money spent on the island ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",187
"188","—Money was spent in works which were a failure, I understand.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",188
"189","16515. Can you point to much of the expenditure that took place for the benefit of the crofters other than the roads ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",189
"190","—The crofters derived no benefit from it. They only were paid 10d. to 1s. 2d. a day, and no labourer would work for 1s. 2d. a day. That was about the wage they got when the improvements were going on.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",190
"191","16516. Except roads, can you point to anything that was done for the direct benefit of the crofters ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",191
"192","—There was nothing done for the benefit of the crofters, as far as my knowledge goes, all over the island. I mean their lands were not improved, and they got no houses, and there were no improvements done of any kind that I know of ; and I know of districts in the Lewis where there are no roads at all, and where these people are paying road money for the last thirty years, and where there has never been a road at all.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",192
"193","16517. Are you aware that a charge has been made upon all the tenants of 5s. for road money, or the most of them ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",193
"194","—Yes, I am.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",194
"195","16518. Are you aware that of late years, with regard to the houses, by the regulations of the estate, those who improved their houses with the consent of the proprietor and his approbation are entitled to a certain melioration ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",195
"196","—I am aware that the people have no confidence themselves in building houses, or laying out money, because they may be turned out of those lands at any time, and they have not got security or fixity of tenure.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",196
"197","16519. But in the clause I refer to it does not say how long they may be, but when they are turned out they are to get compensation for their houses?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",197
"198","—I was not aware of that",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",198
"199","16520. If you look at the articles you will find there is a clause to that effect ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",199
"200","—Those articles might have been in existence ; it is well to have it on paper, but it is a different thing to have it in facts.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",200
"201","16521. You made a very strong statement, which I beg you will reconsider; when you were asked if there were many cases of eviction within the last thirty years, you said people were more frightened of the authorities than of much higher power. Do you adhere to that?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",201
"202","—I do. ",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",202
"203","16522. Has that feeling, which you say prevails here, a very depressing and demoralising effect upon the energies of the crofters ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",203
"204","—It has a very demoralising effect upon the people.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",204
"205","16523. Is it consistent with your own knowledge that some of the authorities—I do not mean any of the present authorities—were such as not to command the confidence of the people ; rather, on the other hand, to keep them in a state of terror and alarm.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",205
"206","—Yes.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",206
"207","16524. I suppose that is pretty well known ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",207
"208","—Well known.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",208
"209","16525. Would such a thing as fining a man 5s. for being late in keeping an appointment, and threatening that he would be turned out if he did such a thing, not have a very demoralising effect upon the people, particularly if there was no redress?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",209
"210","—Yes, that was a very common occurrence.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",210
"211","16526. You were asked about the poverty of the people. Some may be in possession of a couple of cows and sheep, but may not they be in debt to the merchants?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",211
"212","—They are in debt to the merchants. It is the merchants who support them, and they are the ruination of the mercantile community, through taking meal and everything they want on credit, and they are not able to pay; because if they had the land they would be in a first-rate position, and without it they are in",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",212
"213","poverty.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",213
"214","16527. Would the mercantile population of Stornoway not be better by a large thriving population being among them, than with a few tacksmen who do not expend much money?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",214
"215","—Yes, it would revive trade in the town, and would be the best thing for business. If the people got the land back, with the thriving population, it would benefit the country, the wholesale trade as well as the retail.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",215
"216","16528. I suppose you have no personal interest in the crofting community. You are not personally connected with the crofters ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",216
"217","—No, I derive no benefit by this agitation ; I am not paid for it. ",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",217
"218","16529. But you would desire to purchase a small place if you had the opportunity ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",218
"219","—Certainly.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",219
"220","16530. And I suppose many people would be delighted to get an opportunity to acquire land ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",220
"221","—Yes, all over the island.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",221
"222","16531. Is there any complaint in Stornoway about getting grass for cows ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",222
"223","—Yes, the people of Stornoway, at the time Sir James Matheson bought the island, had grass round the town, whereas they have not got it now; and the majority of the tradesmen and working men had an acre or two of land and a head or two of cattle, whereas now they have got nothing at all, and there is now a spirit of discontent all over.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",223
"224","16532. Professor Mackinnon.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",224
"225","—You stated you were quite convinced in your own mind that by a redistribution of the estate it would maintain 70,000 people ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",225
"226","—That is my opinion",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",226
"227","16533. We were told that the rental of the estate was £18,000 Now, I think you stated also that the people would give about as much rent for it, or about as much purchase price for it, as what was paid for it ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",227
"228","—Yes.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",228
"229","16534. Would that imply that, the present rent all over was not too high ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",229
"230","—It is not a matter of rent so much.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",230
"231","16535. I mean all over the estate, and the fact that the people could pay for it as much as Sir James Matheson paid for it, would not that imply that the present rental, as a mere matter of commerce, was not so high ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",231
"232","—They would allow the same price for the island as Sir James paid for it, and it would be only £7, 18s. a head.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",232
"233","16536. Supposing they did that, would the interest of the money that would go to purchase it at that rate—a fair interest for the money,—represent as much as the present yearly rental ? What was the purchase price ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",233
"234","—About £190,000.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",234
"235","16537. And that at 3 per cent, would give nearly £6000 a year. Now, 70,000 people represent 12,000 families. With the present rent of £18,000 that would only give a croft of 30s. to each family ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",235
"236","—I say, that instead of the island supporting 26,000 people in misery it would support 60,000 or 70,000 in a contented way.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",236
"237","16538. The Chairman.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",237
"238","—You have repeated that several times, and we want to satisfy ourselves as to the reasonable grounds on which such an opinion is formed; will you be good enough to answer the questions that are asked ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",238
"239","—Yes, I am endeavouring to do so.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",239
"240","16539. Professor Mackinnon.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",240
"241","—That would be about three times its present population, or nearly three times. Now, I would like to ask you whether you consider there is about three times the amount just now under sheep and deer of the surface of the island than there is under crop ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",241
"242","—I say there is, in my opinion, about three times more land under deer forests and under sheep than the crofters possess.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",242
"243","16540. Considering the moorland pasture that they have also?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",243
"244","—Considering the moorland pasture they have.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",244
"245","16541. Then, acre for acre, and farm for farm, between the sheep tack and the croft, between the deer forest and the croft, which pays the higher rent—the crofting farm or the sheep farm of the same size?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",245
"246","—It is my opinion that the crofting townships pays a higher rent, or quite as high as any tack that would be held by any tacksman or shepherd.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",246
"247","16542. Or deer forest?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",247
"248","—I do not say deer forest.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",248
"249","16543. But you have no place particularly in view, that you can give as an instance where we could verify that instance ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",249
"250","—The land is there, and men are there to show it to you, and the whole district is waste.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",250
"251","16544. But if you could show me a crofting township and a farm much about the same size at the same value, to enable me to see which carries the bigger rent, that would enable me to make up my own mind as to your opinion. Have you any ground for the statement that the crofter pays at least as much, value for value, as the large tacksman does ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",251
"252","—I expect they do. It is my opinion they do.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",252
"253","16545. For deer forests, you may assume, as we have evidence, they pay exorbitant rents ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",253
"254","—They pay an exorbitant rent.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",254
"255","16546. Then, even supposing this place were redistributed among 12,000 families, with its present rent, it would only give a 30s. croft to each man in this island just now. Would that keep the man in comfort ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",255
"256","—I cannot answer that question without knowing what the size of the croft would be.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",256
"257","16547. You yourself gave, as the size of a suitable croft, six to ten acres of arable land. What amount of moorland do you think ought to go along with that croft ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",257
"258","—Give them moorland in common, if the whole township used the moorland in common,",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",258
"259","16548. How many acres of moorland would you give with the arable ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",259
"260","—I cannot answer.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",260
"261","16549. How many times the amount of moorland is there in the whole island in comparison with what you would make arable land out of?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",261
"262","—The half of it, any how.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",262
"263","16550. Do you mean that the half of it is capable of easy cultivation ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",263
"264","—1 do not say the half is capable of easy cultivation, but I maintain there is a considerable proportion of the soil that could be cultivated, and a considerable amount of moorland is under sheep and deer which is fitted for a crofter population.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",264
"265","16551. But you are not able to give me any figures?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",265
"266","—No, I am not. ",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",266
"267","16552. You are of opinion that the people could perfectly well go and occupy these places inland as well as along the shore, and build houses, and maintain themselves in comfort ",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",267
"268","—Yes, they want to get their lands back that their forefathers were deprived of, and I do not suppose they would have any objection to pay a fair rent.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",268
"269","16553. Do you mean to say there is any evidence that there ever were 70,000 people in the Lewis ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",269
"270","—I never heard of 70,000 people being in the Lewis, but I know that if the people got the land, the Lewis would be able to support 70,000 people contentedly and in a good way, and that the place would be a splendid recruiting ground for the army and navy, and that it would produce a race of men without their equal in the whole United Kingdom.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",270
"271","16554. You say that in the future the people would be educated so that they would not remain in the place ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",271
"272","—I maintain that when the people do get educated they will not remain in the place at all.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",272
"273","16555. Even in the improved circumstances of the people that you map out?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",273
"274","—That is my opinion—that they will not remain.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",274
"275","16556. So that the position of the island is to be like this,—that in the immediate future there will be some 70,000 who will afterwards voluntarily clear away ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",275
"276","—No, but any overplus or overcrowding— the balance which the island would not be fit to maintain—would emigrate of their own free will and accord when they get educated, and when they know what the world is doing. But at present there is no use of the people emigrating, because they cannot even talk the English",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",276
"277","language, and they are not educated, and have not been brought up to hard labour.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",277
"278","16557. Are you prepared to state that the people who emigrated from here in 1851 are at present less or more comfortable than those whom they left behind ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",278
"279","—Those whom they left behind, in my opinion, and so far as I know, are far more comfortable than the majority of those that emigrated; I do not mean educated men from the town.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",279
"280","16558. I do not mean such either; I mean those from the country districts. Are they and their children worse off than their neighbours whom they left behind?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",280
"281","—I maintain on authority that they are worse off than those they left behind,",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",281
"282","16559. And you say that those in the Lewis are in poverty and misery and in debt to the Stornoway merchants ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",282
"283","—Yes.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",283
"284","16560. Then those who have emigrated must be very badly off indeed ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",284
"285","—Yes, they are.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",285
"286","16561. You spoke of reclaiming land under present circumstances as penal servitude ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",286
"287","—I mean that parties working for ten or fifteen years reclaiming bog, when they get nothing for their labour, are suffering what I call penal servitude.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",287
"288","16562. We had a witness here yesterday who stated that he himself built upon his croft a house worth £90. Don't you consider that that man had in his own mind a reasonable assurance, either that as matter of fact he would not be turned out of that house, or that he would get something for it when he left ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",288
"289","—He may have had a private arrangement.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",289
"290","16563. He said he had none. Did not the mere fact of building that house indicate a reasonable assurance in that man's mind ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",290
"291","—He might be fool enough to do it, but there were others who built houses and were kicked out, and got no compensation at all.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",291
"292","16564. Can you give me the names of any such?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",292
"293","—Yes.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",293
"294","16565. Who built these valuable houses, aud were turned out?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",294
"295","—I did say valuable houses; I said houses.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",295
"296","16566. But it was a valuable house that I mentioned. Well, give us the name of a man who built a house and was turned out, and got nothing for it?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",296
"297","—I have got the name to give, but I will not give the name without asking his consent, in case summary vengeance might bo taken upon him otherwise.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",297
"298","16567. You represent particularly the district of Bay Head. Have you any particular grievance from the Bay ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",298
"299","—The principal grievance is that the lands they had were taken from them, and they want them back again. In common with the workmen of the town, they would like very much to get back the lands from which they were driven, and which they are willing to pay for.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",299
"300","16568. Where were these lands?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",300
"301","—All round the town.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",301
"302","16569. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",302
"303","—You were asked what extent of arable land would be sufficient for an enlarged croft, if the man would be able to live upon it?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",303
"304","—I said from six to ten acres of arable land, with moorland in connection with it and in common.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",304
"305","16570. The extent of the arable land is quite fixed?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",305
"306","—From six to ten acres is the average of crofters' land of good quality. ",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",306
"307","16571. But it is impossible to tell by acres what the moorland would be, because the hill pasture varies very much, does it not?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",307
"308","—They use the hill pasture in common.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",308
"309","16572. But supposing a crofter could get a piece of hill land to himself I suppose it would depend very much upon the nature of the hill pasture what extent it would be necessary to use along with the croft ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",309
"310","—It would depend upon the nature and quality of it, because in some districts the hill pasture is better than in other districts.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",310
"311","16573. Then is it not the proper way to ascertain what would make a croft comfortable in the way of pasture, to know how many sheep and how many cows it would pasture in summer ? Is not that the proper way to get at it?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",311
"312","—The proper way to get at it is to give them the hill pasture and the land, and they can arrange those matter themselves.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",312
"313","16574. What stock would be necessary for the crofter to live in comfort ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",313
"314","—I should fancy from six to ten head of cattle and from forty to fifty head of sheep.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",314
"315","16575. Would they require a couple of horses?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",315
"316","—Not necessarily; it might require one horse.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",316
"317","16576. Then that is the size of croft which would enable the crofter to live in comfort ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",317
"318","—Yes, that is what I consider.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",318
"319","16577. You were asked some question about what should happen in the future. If such enlarged croft were laid out, I presume you would prevent subdivision of the croft ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",319
"320","—Yes, undoubtedly.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",320
"321","16578. And you believe that emigration would voluntarily take place?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",321
"322","—Yes,",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",322
"323","16579. That the people would see the evils of subdivision so much that they would not permit subdivision to take place?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",323
"324","—Yes, that is what I mean.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",324
"325","16580. Would you make that compulsory?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",325
"326","—Yes, I would make it compulsory to have whole lots without subdivision.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",326
"327","16581. To a certain extent, you would prohibit subdivision by law ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",327
"328","—Yes, I would.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",328
"329","16582. The Chairman.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",329
"330","—What roads were in the island when Sir James Matheson bought it ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",330
"331","—I know that the people worked at relief works—making roads.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",331
"332","16583. But were there any roads in the island; and if so, to what points did they lead?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",332
"333","—Yes, there were roads in the island.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",333
"334","16581. Where to?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",334
"335","—I think there were roads all the way from here to Ness. ",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",335
"336","16585. A road you could drive over?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",336
"337","—Yes. ",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",337
"338","16586. Any other roads?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",338
"339","—Yes, there were other ones.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",339
"340","16587. But you do not know them?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",340
"341","—I am not confident about them, because it was before my time.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",341
"342","16588. Did Sir James Matheson build any schools in the island?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",342
"343","—He may have done so, but I am not aware of any schools.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",343
"344","16589. Was there steam communication with the mainland when Sir James came here ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",344
"345","—Yes, there was.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",345
"346","16590. I am afraid you are mistaken. Are you not aware that Sir James put on the ' Mary Jane' himself, the first steamer that traded with the island ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",346
"347","—No, I was not aware of that till now.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",347
"348","16591. You mentioned that Sir James made certain improvements at a certain time, at what time were those improvements made ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",348
"349","—I suppose about fifteen years ago.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",349
"350","16592. Do you mean he paid 1s. 2d. per day fifteen years ago ? Are you not speaking of the years 1848 to 1852?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",350
"351","—The only improvements he did in the Lewis that I know of were on the grounds round the castle.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",351
"352","16593. That is within your recollection; but you have been talking of things far beyond your recollection. In improving the castle grounds within your recollection, was he in the habit of paying people 10d. per day ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",352
"353","—So far as I know, and have been told, the wages on the average were from 10d. to 14d. per day,—within the last ten or fifteen years,—in my own day. That is what I have been informed.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",353
"354","16594. Where did you get your information ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",354
"355","—I come in contact with a great deal of information. I am always on the move.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",355
"356","16595. Was it from the people who received these wages?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",356
"357","—Well, I have been hearing about it all round.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",357
"358","16596. Did you get it directly?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",358
"359","—No, I have not got it directly.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",359
"360","16597. Are you aware that at no distant period a shilling a day was the usual wage for labour in this country ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",360
"361","—Within the last forty or fifty years the working wages in this country for unskilled labour were two shillings a day.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",361
"362","16598. You are not aware that the rise in wages from a shilling took place in 1848?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",362
"363","—No, I am not aware of that.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",363
"364","16599. You mentioned that the people were quite willing to go inland, to take crofts inland as well as on the shore ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",364
"365","—They are willing to take the land that was under cultivation before, and is now under deer and sheep.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",365
"366","16600. Is there such land inland ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",366
"367","—Yes.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",367
"368","16601. Where is it?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",368
"369","—Park.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",369
"370","16602. That is on the sea-shore?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",370
"371","—It is inland a good deal too.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",371
"372","16603. Are you aware that an attempt was made to settle crofters at Little Deanston and failed ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",372
"373","—No.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",373
"374","16604. Is the Rev. Angus M'lver a member of your association?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",374
"375","—He is not.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",375
"376","16605. He gave it as his opinion that the crofters to be comfortable should pay only half the present rent, but I think it is your opinion that the rent over the whole island is not too high ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",376
"377","—I say the matter of rent is not the principal grievance; it is the matter of land. They want the land altogether.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",377
"378","16606. But rent has really a good deal to do with it. Do you think that the island is not too highly rented, or is it too highly rented?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",378
"379","—Some of the crofters complain that the rents are high enough; but it is not the rent question that is agitating the people at all ",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",379
"380","16607. The acreage of the island is 417,000 acres. You think that would hold 70,000 people comfortably?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",380
"381","—I think it would.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",381
"382","16608. Have you divided 417,000 acres by 70,000, and found how many acres it would give to each ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",382
"383","—No, I have not",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",383
"384","16609. It gives between 5½ and 6 acres to each, and you know yourself the character of a great deal of the land. You mentioned the stock which the people in your opinion should have. Now, taking 70,000 people, or say 12,000 families, with one horse, eight cattle, and forty-five sheep for each family—the total stock which the island would need to carry would be 12,000 horses, 96,000 head of cattle, and 540,000 head of sheep. Do you think the island would be capable of carrying that stock ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",384
"385","—I say there would be a considerable proportion of those people who would be at the fishing industry.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",385
"386","16610. Say half of them ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",386
"387","—Perhaps half of them.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",387
"388","16611. Then do you think there is sufficient land to carry the half of the stock I have mentioned,—or 6000 horses, 48,000 head of cattle, and 270,000 head of sheep?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",388
"389","—I am not prepared to answer that.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",389
"390","16612. You say that each family ought to have from six to ten acres of arable land and a share of the hill pasture attached to it. Well, with the stock above mentioned, it has been calculated that you would require, some three and a half million acres instead of 417,000 acres. But you have given us your statement as matter of opinion, you are not prepared to give the ground of your opinion ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",390
"391","—No.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",391
"392","16613. Sheriff Nicolson.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",392
"393","—We have had evidence enough to show us that, in the late Sir James Matheson's time, there were many things done which were perhaps not to be approved of, by persons who perhaps very ill represented him. I wish to put a question as to what good he did; I do not think that the good things men do should be entirely forgotten, or unknown to a new generation. You said that Sir James Matheson had done nothing to your knowledge for the benefit of the crofters. Was it not for the benefit of the crofters to expend large sums of money on the schools in the island ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",393
"394","—The Free Church expended large sums.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",394
"395","16614. That is not an answer. Was it not a thing for the benefit of the crofters to spend money for the education of their children ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",395
"396","—I was not aware that sums were expended in the country districts by Sir James.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",396
"397","16615. Did you never hear that for years before the Education Act was passed Sir James Matheson contributed liberally to the support of every school in the island, and that he expended thousands of pounds in that way ?",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",397
"398","—I was not aware of that till now.",301,"Alexander Morrison","Lewis, Stornoway",398
