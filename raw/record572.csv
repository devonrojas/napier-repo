"1","DONALD SINCLAIR, Cottar, Balphuil (40), assisted by ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL, Cottar, Balphuil (49)—examined.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",1
"2","34280. The Chairman.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",2
"3","—Would you please to make your statement?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",3
"4","— The principal grievances or hardships of which we have to complain are the following :",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",4
"5","—The most/of us, and our fathers before us, had crofts, and without any reason being assigned they were taken from us. Our crofts were then added to the neighbouring sheep farm. We then had to build new houses at the shore, without any compensation for the houses left. The only means of living then left us was fishing, and owing to the want of a safe harbour we are unable to prosecute the fishing to any great extent. On that account we have only small boats which we must haul up every night so as to be out of danger. Again, our houses are nearly a mile distant from where our boats land, and that being the case we have many a time to go even at midnight to look after them. On coining from the fishing with these there is none at shore to render any assistance, as our homes are so far from the sort of quay we have. This again gives us great inconvenience when we go for meal, salt, or coals, with our boats to where the steamer lands, that is a distance of six or seven miles, and on coming back we have to pay dearly for a horse and cart to take such goods to our homes. The inconvenience would be great had it only been that; we have to carry the fish home on our backs. It may be mentioned that the Fisheries Board built a quay previous to cur crofts being added to the neighbouring sheep farm. It is at that quay, although in a very ruined condition, that our boats are still landing. There are no signs of said quay being repaired, although the proprietor promised to keep it in repair after the board built it. What we now  want is a safe harbour, and our houses built near it, so that we could prosecute the fishing in a right style. We also want as much land as will enable us to keep a cow and plant some potatoes, for which we are willing to pay a reasonable rent.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",5
"6","34281. You say that the meal in the company's store is 8s. per bag higher—how much is the oatmeal at the company's store per boll ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",6
"7","—It is over £ 2 per two bolls.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",7
"8","34282. How much would that be per boll ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",8
"9","—£1 per boll.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",9
"10","34283. Is that higher than the current price in the country ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",10
"11","—Yes.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",11
"12","34284. We have generally heard that the price of oatmeal is either over £ 1 or 21s. per boll?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",12
"13","—We do not get that kind of meal here.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",13
"14","34285. What is the chemical work of which you speak ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",14
"15","—It is in connection with their work south—the manufacture of iodine.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",15
"16","34286. Are you employed at so much a day or per week in this work ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",16
"17","—We do not know.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",17
"18","34287. Does the company never show you the account in which the value of your work is written down?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",18
"19","—The only way to know your wages is to go and ask for more provision, which usually consists of Indian meal, tea, and sugar, and the only account that is rendered is that you are told there is nothing to your credit.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",19
"20","34288. Does the company buy things as well as sell ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",20
"21","—They take eggs in return for provisions.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",21
"22","34289. Do they take eggs from the families of the people whom they employ ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",22
"23","—Yes, from any one.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",23
"24","34290. Do they pay for the things they buy ready money, or do they enter that into the account ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",24
"25","—Goods in return for the eggs—goods only.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",25
"26","34291. You never got money from the company for your work or for the eggs or other commodities'?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",26
"27","—Well, we got occasionally Is. or 2s. to put half soles upon our shoes, or the like of that ; but we must tell what we want the shillings for before we get them.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",27
"28","34292. Have you ever complained of this system to the factor?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",28
"29","—No, but we complained to a member of the company who was here recently, either to give us more wages or to give us the meal at the current rate of the country.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",29
"30","34293. What did he say?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",30
"31","—His reason was that it would be so much money into his pocket if there were none of them working at all, implying thereby it was out of charity that he employed us at all.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",31
"32","34294. When did this company come into the country?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",32
"33","—About twenty years ago.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",33
"34","34295. Do they hold their storehouse and premises as tenants from the proprietor, or from some farmer or tacksman ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",34
"35","—We understand that they hold direct from the proprietor, and pay him rent for the shores as well as for the land.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",35
"36","34296. You speak of working in gathering tangle or sea-weed; is this a new kind of work in the country ; was it introduced in connection with the company ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",36
"37","—Yes; but the kelp was manufactured before that time, and when the kelp was being made in the country the proprietor bought it. We got £ 5 a ton for it",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",37
"38","34297. But did you gather tangle in the same way at night ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",38
"39","—They did not use the tangle for the manufacture of kelp at that time.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",39
"40","34298. Do you frequently gather the tangle in the middle of the night?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",40
"41","—Yes, I was at it myself; of course, we-must attend as the tide suits.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",41
"42","34299. Do the women and children work at night ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",42
"43","—Yes.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",43
"44","34300. Do you really say that women and children occasionally at least go out at midnight to gather the tangle upon the shore ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",44
"45","—Yes; my sister was a widow with three children, and she was out with me gathering those tangles at night. The night was so dark that if I did not see it I could feel it among the sea-ware.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",45
"46","34301. Was that in the winter?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",46
"47","—Yes, it is in the winter that we take it.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",47
"48","34302. How much is it possible to make by the day or week at this work—you named 4d. per yard ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",48
"49","—I believe if there was a very strong young man and a very strong young man along with him they could both possibly make 2s. 6d. each in a day; but very often we can get none for weeks ; sometimes not for a month —sometimes only an armful.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",49
"50","34303. Did your sister's children work at this work at night with her ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",50
"51","—Yes, her children were along with her; and that is customary all over the place, as the tide suits.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",51
"52","34304. Does the company sell coals ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",52
"53","—Yes, it is always dearer than the current price of the country.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",53
"54","34305. (To Archibald Campbell).",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",54
"55","—What is your case?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",55
"56","—In addition to what is stated in the paper, we think that if the quay in our place was put in order and kept up we might have larger boats, and might prosecute the fishing with greater success. We live a mile from the quay. We were removed at the time the nine crofters were cleared away, as was spoken about in the former part of the day. My father had one of those crofts. When my father lost the croft he was sent to a smithy that was in the place. He gave that croft to another man to crop it for the year. We had to begin to quarry stones and build the house for ourselves. We would not get a stone or a stick that belonged to the place when we left.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",56
"57","34306. Have you anything more to say on the part of the other people ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",57
"58","— Yes, we think that if, in addition to the quay being put in order, we were removed down close to it, and got some bit of land with cow's grass, we could be able to make our living as fishermen.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",58
"59","34307. (To Donald Sinclair.)",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",59
"60","—What do you pay for oatmeal at the company's store?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",60
"61","—About £1 the boll, more or less ; sometimes 19s., and sometimes a little over £1.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",61
"62","34308. How much would it cost if you bought it at a shop in the island ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",62
"63","—Eighteen shillings sometimes ; sometimes higher.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",63
"64","34309. Then the two prices are very nearly the same ?",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",64
"65","—No.",572,"Donald Sinclair, Archibald Campbell","Argyll, Tyree",65
