"1","MURDO STEWART, Crofter, Achiltubuie (60)—examined.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",1
"2","28072. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",2
"3","—Have you any statement?",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",3
"4","—Yes.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",4
"5","The grievances of the crofters of Achiltubuie and Badinscallie are much the same as those complained of everywhere else —inferior quality of lands, excessive rents, no compensation given for tenants' improvements, and want of fixity of tenure. About fifty years ago, when the lands were laid out in lots there were seventy-two families on as many lots; now on the same lots there are 104 families. A number of the crofters of the township of Badinscallie have no roads to their houses, and their children run very great risks in going to and coming from school from want of a road. It is not merely that roads are wanting in some very critical places ; but from some curious ideas which have pervaded in the minds of those who manage the affairs of the estate. Roads have been made, as for example that from Druimraonaidh to the east of Badinscallie, a distance of about twenty-two miles. Now between Druimraonaidh and Achiltubuie there is only one solitary house for a shepherd. By the abovementioned road there are thirty-one miles between the east end of Badinscallie and Ullapool, the chief town of the district of Coigach. And yet while that road has been made for the accommodation of sheep-farmers and deer stalkers, one of the wildest paths, that by which the Coigach people go to Ullapool, has never had a road made in it. This year a road was made to the east end of Badinscallie, but i t now terminates near the brink of a dangerous river over which the children pass to school, and the seven miles from that abrupt termination, along the face of the Big Rock, remain a succession of dangers to those who venture to pass. In speaking of the roads, we think it is necessary to state that",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",5
"6","these two townships are in an exceedingly awkward position in relation to the national centres, and even to t h e local ones. They are situated along the south-west margin of the rough and mountainous stretch of country which forms the northern side of the entrance from the Atlantic to the two Loch Brooms, and have for their commercial capital the town of Ullapool. The east end of Badinscallie is cut off from Ullapool by the Big Rock, to a degree which cannot well be understood without seeing the said Rock. We respectfully take the liberty of suggesting that in passing out of Lochbroom the Royal Commissioners would keep a northwest course for some miles, and have a full view of the giddy line of scrambling which has to be followed by the carrier of Her Majesty's mails, along the face of rocks high and steep and slippery enough to try t he equilibrium of a goat as well as of a man. About thirty-two years ago the township of Badinscallie was let to a man named Alexander M'Kenzie who was postmaster and shopkeeper in Ullapool. He laid on impost under which each tenant was obliged to supply him with thirty creels of peats, per annum, delivered to him and deposited in his cellar, or pay a penalty of 7s. 6d. which penalty is still exacted by the factor of the Duchess of Sutherland. As another example of the details in the factorial system of management, mention may be made of the fact that two lots in Badinscallie, happening at one time to have a cornmill each for the accommodation of the district, had £ 1 each laid on the rent. All the profit from the mills have been entirely taken away about nine years ago, by the building of another mill. The crofters still continue to pay the £ 2 , although the mills are now in ruins. While we are taught that so many of us should devote themselves entirely to fishing, no fishing stations or landing places have been constructed. It is seldom now that a family can do without buying from five to seven bolls of meal in the year, and the more general rule is that they buy from twelve to fifteen bolls. The calculation with many is that in good years they will raise of food what, in meal and potatoes will keep them for three or four months in the year. So that in reality the rent and the greater part of the support of the people come out of the sea, and other industrial sources. Not to enlarge any longer in this direction, we respectfully submit the following suggestions for the bettering of our condition. That a substantial reduction, be made on existing rents ; that compensation be given for tenants' improvements j that fixity of tenure be granted; that the attention of the Government be called to the unsatisfactory mail service; and the providing of piers on our shores so as to admit of the young and strong among us devoting some of their energies to enriching themselves by drawing upon the wealth of the sea.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",6

"8","A glaring instance of refusal to give any compensation for improvements.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",8
"9","—Alexander"" Grant, crofter in the east end of Badinscallie, spent about £40, besides labour performed by himself. His rent was only raised, and Mr Gunn, factor, refused to give any compensation.for work done on the farm. Owing to the excessive rent, he gave up the farm this year. The said Alexander Grant will be present, and can be examined himself.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",9
"10","28073. I suppose this paper was written before you were aware that the Commissioners passed by the Big Rock on Saturday?",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",10
"11","—Yes.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",11
"12","28074. Would it be possible at any moderate expense to make a road through the Big Rock ?",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",12
"13","—Yes.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",13

"16","28076. Would it not be a very costly road ?",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",16
"17","—Yes, it would cost a good deal of money; roads over rough places always cost money.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",17
"18","28077. Would you expect the proprietor to be at such an outlay as to make a road through that place ?",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",18
"19","—Yes, I think so, when it is upon his own land.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",19
"20","28078. Would the rent of Coigach pay for it ?",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",20
"21","—I am unable to answer that.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",21
"22","28079. How long is it since your rents were raised last ?",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",22

"32","28084. Does the rise of 22s. entitle you to keep a horse?",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",32
"33","—If we kept a horse we would not have a cow or any animal but itself ; we will not have enough to maintain it.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",33

"40","28088. Is it at the curing station of Tanera that you deliver your fish ?",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",40
"41","—Yes, at this very time.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",41

"46","28091. Where would you think best to have a harbour and quay?",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",46
"47","—I would not like to say anything that would be objectionable to other people, I would only speak for myself.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",47
"48","28092. Is Tanera not a very convenient place for the village of Achiltubuie?",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",48

"52","28094. Would Achiltubuie be more suitable for the country in general ?",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",52
"53","—Yes ; it is on the mainland while Tanera is only an island.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",53
"54","28095. Is there a suitable place for making a harbour on the mainland ?",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",54
"55","Yes there is such a place, but it would cost labour and expense. ",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",55
"56","28096. Would it be reasonable—moderate labour and expense ?",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",56
"57","—I cannot very well give any idea whether tbe expense would be reasonable ; I know that the convenience of it would be very great.",468,"Murdo Stewart","Ross-shire, Ullapool",57
