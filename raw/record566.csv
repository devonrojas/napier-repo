"16","—Yes, it is more centred in Inveraray.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",16

"44","—Most of them very favourable, and would not like to return.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",44
"45","33902. But has that encouraged other people to go abroad and join them ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",45
"46","—No, very few have gone; I may say none at all.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",46
"47","33903. Do you find the tendency for people to go and seek their fortunes abroad more extensive than it was, or less so ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",47

"73","—Yes.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",73
"74","33916. And to submit designs of a suitable, substantial pier?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",74
"75","—Yes, and these were submitted to the Duke.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",75
"76","33917. And do you say that the engineers submitted designs of a pier with the remark that it would not stand?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",76

"90","33924. But I mean not this year only, but has the price of stock been gradually rising ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",90

"104","33931. Was there any great distress last year?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",104
"105","—Not very.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",105
"106","33932. From the failure of the crops ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",106
"107","—No very great distress.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",107

"114","33936. Is it expected to be repaid?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",114
"115","—In some cases. ",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",115
"116","33937. Cases where the people are sufficiently well off to do so?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",116
"117","—Yes. ",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",117
"118","33938. We heard something in the course of the evidence about sea-ware. Can you tell us what the regulations of the estate are in regard to the people getting sea-ware ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",118
"119","—The complaint was about that farm I got last Whitsunday. It seems the tenants of Balamartin always give a certain amount of labour for getting sea-ware off this farm, and the same thing was attached to it when I got it. I did not make any new rules to them.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",119
"120","33939. When you got the farm you found that these tenants were bound to give so many days' labour on the farm ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",120
"121","—Yes.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",121
"122","33910. And in return for the labour they were allowed to take away sea-ware, was that it ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",122
"123","—Yes.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",123
"124","33911. What is the position of affairs now?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",124
"125","—It is still the same.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",125
"126","33912. That they give the labour and take away sea-ware in return?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",126
"127","—Yes.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",127
"128","33913. Was that included in the rent which you give for the farm ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",128
"129","—Not at all, it was always understood between the tenant of that farm and those smaller tenants.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",129
"130","33914. But I mean is it included in the bargain which you made at the time you entered into the farm ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",130
"131","—That is a bargain with the proprietor.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",131
"132","33915. It was one of the advantages you got when you took the farm?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",132
"133","—No, I did not discover it until after I took the farm.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",133
"134","33916. Then you discovered yourself to bo in a better position than when you took the farm ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",134
"135","—I suppose I did.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",135
"136","33917. How many days' labour are these people supposed to give ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",136
"137","—Two or three days in the year, and they have to put up fifteen carts of sea-ware off the shore.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",137
"138","33918. For you ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",138
"139","—Yes.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",139
"140","33919. How many days' labour would that take ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",140
"141","—About two days.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",141
"142","33950. How far have they to carry the sea-ware ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",142
"143","—In some instances about perhaps 500 or 600 yards, and in other places longer than that.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",143
"144","33951. Have they ever complained to you at all about that or objected to it ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",144
"145","—We talked about it.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",145
"146","33952. Did it ever occur to you to suggest to the Duke that it would be very much to the comfort and contentment of the people if an alteration in the terms of the lease was made by which this could be done away with ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",146
"147","—No. I may state that I find the arrangement very troublesome, and if they can do without the wrack I will do without their work. I have often sent my carts there and could not get a pound of wrack on the shore.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",147
"148","33953. They give their labour in exchange for the right of taking the sea-ware ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",148
"149","—Yes.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",149
"150","33954. Can no arrangements be made by which a limited 'portion of the coast should be set apart for them to take sea-ware, reserving to your farm what would be required for its proper manuring.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",150
"151","—That would be a very difficult arrangement to make, because the sea-ware all comes in a sort of common, and it would be difficult to arrange to give them a share of it—in fact, almost impossible.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",151
"152","33955. Can you tell us anything about the kelp manufacture ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",152
"153","—The kelp manager is here himself, and perhaps might give you some evidence.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",153
"154","33956. Have you any observation to make upon the evidence which you have heard given—did you take any notes ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",154
"155","—Yes, but I wish to go to Bunessan, where Mr Wylie will be; I have been taking notes for him.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",155
"156","33957. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",156
"157","—I don't know what your position exactly is here; is your advice accepted in the letting of farms ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",157
"158","—No, I don't let farms at all.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",158
"159","33958. What are your duties as sub-factor?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",159
"160","—Just doing any work through the estate and collecting the rents once a year.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",160
"161","33959. And you superintend any expenditure?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",161
"162","—Yes.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",162
"163","33960. Do you not give any advice if a farm falls vacant?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",163
"164","—I am quite admitted to do that if the Duke or chamberlain asks me.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",164
"165","33961. Mr Wylie takes his information from you?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",165
"166","—To a certain extent.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",166
"167","33962. Do you know what the policy of the estate is when small crofts fall vacant; is it the policy of the estate to join them together; and when large farms fall vacant is it the policy to enlarge them or to restrict their size ? Is there any desire to alter the present character of the holding, or is the desire to retain the present character of the holding ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",167
"168","—The character of the holding is retained very much.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",168
"169","33963. There is no wish to enlarge a croft?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",169
"170","—In some cases they have been enlarged, and in some cases they have been reduced.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",170
"171","33964. What do you consider a suitable size of croft on which a man can make a living and pay his rent fairly?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",171
"172","—It is a difficult question to answer; I would rather not answer it.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",172
"173","33965. With regard to the character of the cultivation here; you yourself are a considerable farmer ; is yours principally a grazing or an arable farm ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",173
"174","—It is a grazing farm now, but it was arable, a good deal of it, at one time.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",174
"175","33966. You are not an arable farmer?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",175
"176","—No.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",176
"177","33967. You are not competent to give an answer as to cultivation?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",177
"178","—I am not an arable farmer here.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",178
"179","33968. Have you been so elsewhere ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",179
"180","—Yes.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",180
"181","33969. Do you think the cultivation here is as good as it might be amongst the crofters ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",181
"182","—I think they are very fair farmers here.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",182
"183","33970. I saw the lands here were sown with old grey oats and rye, and that the crops were thin and light; do you think nothing better can be made of the soil than is produced ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",183
"184","—You say you have seen old grey oats and rye; I don't think anything else would grow here in the land you",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",184
"185","have seen that in, except barley.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",185
"186","33971. The soil is very inferior —or is it the climate?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",186
"187","—The soil is very light; there is something in the nature of it that wont grow large oats.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",187
"188","33972. But it is also very thin in the stalk?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",188
"189","—That must arise from the soil, I think.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",189
"190","33973. Not from too thin sowing or want of manuring?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",190
"191","—It might arise from all these; it depends very much on the farmer.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",191

"196","33976. Do you think that consistent with good farming?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",196
"197","—They seem to make some money out of their horses. They keep them as a source of revenue.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",197
"198","33977. As breeding stock ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",198

"206","—I could not say as to that",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",206

"210","—I think the most of the increase was on the larger farm  decidedly. ",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",210

"244","33999. Have you not got an estate plan ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",244

"253","—I cannot say that I see much difference.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",253

"255","—I suppose it is greatly out of curiosity.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",255
"256","34005. You won't attribute it to a deeper ground ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",256

"258","34006. Do you think they have any grievances ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",258

"263","—No.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",263
"264","34009. Is that not considered a grievance ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",264
"265","—I think it is a very good thing there is not.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",265
"266","34010. What do people say about it ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",266
"267","—I have never heard them complain.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",267
"268","34011. How long is it since it has been done away with ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",268
"269","—I could not say.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",269

"273","—I suppose they may get it from a neighbour.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",273
"274","34011. But where will the neighbour get it ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",274
"275","—Well, there are ways and means always—by having it in the house, they will get it from the",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",275

"279","34016. There was a licence—probably more than one—at one time?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",279
"280","—I suppose there was one at one time.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",280
"281","34017. Was the licence taken away on the ipse dixit of the Duke or at the wish of the people ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",281
"282","—I don't know. It was before my time, and I never inquired.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",282
"283","34018. Supposing this were done, not by request of the people but by the wish of the Duke himself, would it not indicate that a person taking that step was one exercising a close interest in the people ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",283
"284","—I believe it was for their good the Duke did it ; there is no doubt about that, because I believe he would get a large rent for a public house there.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",284
"285","34019. That is one instance of the interest he takes in the people ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",285
"286","—There is no doubt it was done for their good.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",286
"287","34020. Can you mention any other overt act showing his interest in the people of Tyree ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",287
"288","—I know he always takes an interest in them, and would like them to be well off.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",288
"289","34021. That is a generality j can you point to anything more specific?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",289
"290","—I cannot say.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",290
"291","34022. You heard what the previous witness stated, that the Duke came and went without its apparently doing any perceptible good ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",291

"302","—Yes, I applied myself for some for the people here.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",302
"303","31428. Does that not denote there was a little more than usual distress ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",303
"304","—I admit there was that.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",304
"305","34029. But you consider that was exceptional rather?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",305
"306","—No doubt about it.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",306
"307","34030. Were you troubled here with the great storms that went over the west coast ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",307

"310","—Is there no house on the island for the accommodation of strangers ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",310
"311","—Oh, yes, there is a temperance hotel. ",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",311
"312","34032. The Chairman.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",312

"315","34033. Were those farms, or cither of them, in the hands of a resident tenant before or an absentee tenant ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",315
"316","—One of them was in the hands of a resident tenant and one of them in the hands of an absentee.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",316
"317","34034. So that, as far as resident tenure is concerned, they are just where they were ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",317
"318","—Just where they were.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",318
"319","34035. In reference to the farms of above £100 of annual rental in the island, are there any of the farmers or tenants non-resident, or are they all resident ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",319

"328","—Three farms on which there is no separate tenant.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",328

"332","—The benefit of the road is entirely theirs more or less; the benefit is theirs except a small piece at the end of it.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",332

"334","—Yes, it is meant for the township.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",334

"336","—They have always been keeping up that road themselves, but how long or what time they take to work upon it I don't know. I have never heard that statement before.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",336
"337","34044. Does it appear to you that twenty days' labour in the year is unlikely ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",337
"338","—I know they spend a good deal of labour on it ; there is a good deal of labouring in keeping that road.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",338

"342","—Not until this year; but he has offered to do it this year.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",342
"343","34047. Why did the proprietor particularly offer to do it this year; was it to afford work in distress ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",343
"344","—Not at all, but they represented to me it was a hardship, and I spoke to the chamberlain, and the Duke said he was willing to assist to keep it up.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",344
"345","34048. One of the delegates exhibited a plan from which it appeared that the kelp company, or sea-weed company, was in the possession of five crofts; what is the reason that those crofts are in the occupancy of the",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",345
"346","company ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",346
"347","—The company farm some land to keep their horses in food.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",347
"348","3404 9. Would the company not find it possible to purchase their food ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",348
"349","—I suppose they would find it cheaper to work their own land. They do a great deal of good to the island.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",349
"350","34050. We heard it stated that the company did not pay wages, or very little, in money, but pay their wages in goods ; what is the reason of that ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",350
"351","—I cannot say.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",351
"352","34051. Is it the fact?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",352

"354","34052. Have you ever heard it stated iu public or in the island that the people did not receive money wages ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",354
"355","—I heard that that was the case. In some instances I have heard where they have got money.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",355
"356","34053. But have you heard it stated that the general system of traffic with the company is the truck system, or the payment of wages in goods?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",356
"357","—That is spoken of by the people.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",357

"359","—No, never.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",359

"361","—I could not say whether he is or not.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",361
"362","34056. What is the nature of the commodities in which the company deals ?",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",362
"363","—Just a regular store or shop.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",363

"365","—No, I am not aware that they purchase anything.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",365

"369","—Yes, there is an agricultural show held here every year.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",369

"371","—Cattle and horses and butter.",566,"Hugh Macdiarmid","Argyll, Tyree",371
