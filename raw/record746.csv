"1","JOHN MACMILLAN, Fisherman (53)—examined.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",1
"2","46421. Professor Mackinnon.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",2
"3","—You have heard what Mr Carmichael said ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",3
"4","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",4
"5","46422. Do you agree with the representation he gave of the fishing of the place?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",5
"6","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",6
"7","46423. Is there anything you wish to add yourself in the way of explanation ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",7
"8","—No, not a great deal.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",8
"9","46424. Have you always been a fisherman yourself ? ",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",9
"10","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",10
"11","46425. Were your people at the fishing too, or did your father have land?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",11
"12","—Yes, he had land.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",12
"13","46426. Was it on your father's land you were brought up?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",13
"14","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",14
"15","46427. And you remember very well the time when the people used to fish and have crofts ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",15
"16","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",16
"17","46428. There was not so much fish caught then at Tarbert as there is now?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",17
"18","—No, not so much; there was no trawling at that time.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",18
"19","46429. The trawling has increased the amount of fish that is caught?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",19
"20","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",20
"21","46430. Do you agree with Mr Carmichael that in Loch Fyne—in Tarbert at least—the fishing is quite sufficient during the season for any man to attend to ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",21
"22","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",22
"23","46431. And not to spend his time between fishing and working land?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",23
"24","—We have plenty to do to work at the fishing itself, only there are some people here who have crofts and attend the trawling as well.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",24
"25","46432. Are they able to do as much as those who give their whole time to the fishing?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",25
"26","—Yes. In the case of a small croft, I do not think it would do any harm to any one. I do not think it would keep a man back in the least if it could be got at a reasonable price.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",26
"27","46433. But there is no croft here to be had ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",27
"28","—No, there is not a great deal.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",28
"29","46434. And it would be only a very small bit that one could work ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",29
"30","—Yes, a cow's grass, or a piece of potato ground, or the like of that",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",30
"31","46435. Where were you brought up ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",31
"32","—About two and a half miles from here on the Kiutyre side.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",32
"33","46436. On the Loch Fyne side or West Loch Tarbert side?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",33
"34","—On the West Loch Tarbert side.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",34
"35","46437. All the fishermen here have a share in their boats ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",35
"36","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",36
"37","46438. There is really no curer to speak of ashore; the fishermen send the fish away daily ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",37
"38","—They do cure when it comes on in the year, when there are more herring coming in than they can send fresh to market. The great bulk are sent fresh to market, but there is a little cured at the end of the season.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",38
"39","46439. Do the fishermen pay for their boats when they get them, or do they purchase them on credit, and pay for them in so many years ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",39
"40","—They very often pay them when they get them.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",40
"41","46440. They just club together and buy the boat?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",41
"42","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",42
"43","46441. And buy a new one when the old one is done?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",43
"44","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",44
"45","46442. Sheriff Nicolson.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",45
"46","—How long does a boat last?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",46
"47","—Generally about eight or nine years. They get weaker then, and need repairs.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",47
"48","46443. Do you sell the old ones ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",48
"49","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",49
"50","46444. Who buy them?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",50
"51","—Some north country people buy them, and Loch Fyne men, and so on.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",51
"52","46445. People who cannot afford perhaps to buy new ones so easily ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",52
"53","—Yes. The boats are good enough, though they are getting a little frail.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",53
"54","46446. But not good for the hard work they have to undergo with you ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",54
"55","—No.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",55
"56","46447. Where do your people get their nets ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",56
"57","—They buy the nets in the village very often, from the shopkeepers. There are plenty to be had in the village.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",57
"58","46448. And there are plenty of shops ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",58
"59","—Plenty of shops.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",59
"60","46449. There is nothing here of what we found in the north and other places, of people contracted to a curer to whom the boats sometimes belong, and to whom the nets belong ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",60
"61","—No ; nothing of that sort.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",61
"62","46450. You fish for whomsoever you please ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",62
"63","—For whomsoever will give the best price.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",63
"64","46451. And you buy in any shop you please?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",64
"65","—Yes, there is no compulsion as to that.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",65
"66","46452. Of course, your system of trawling herring here is quite different from the bottom trawling that is carried on at the white fishing?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",66
"67","—It is not the same at all; it is on a different scale altogether.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",67
"68","46453. The fact is that so far as we know the habits of the herring, that system would not suit ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",68
"69","—No.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",69
"70","46454. You might trawl the whole day and not get a herring at all?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",70
"71","—You might trawl for a year and not get a herring at all with the big trawl, although we do trawl on the ground whiles.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",71
"72","46455. When you come to shallow water?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",72
"73","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",73
"74","46456. Your mode of trawling is not so popular away in the north?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",74
"75","—No, they have a sort of superstition against it.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",75
"76","46457. But so far as your experience goes, it does not injure the fishing ground ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",76
"77","—I do not believe it does.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",77
"78","46458. And I suppose the Loch Fyne fishers think that instead of people objecting to this system, it would be better if they would accept it for themselves ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",78
"79","—The upper Loch Fyne fishermen used to be against it too, but they are now at it as well as we.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",79
"80","46459. Instead of the long drift net which is used by the big boats on the east coast, and out on the ocean on the west shore, do you think, if it could be done, a shorter trawl net would take as much fish on board—in the ocean too ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",80
"81","—It would need good calm weather. I do not think it would work very well. ",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",81
"82","46460. Of course, you could only work it with a light boat ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",82
"83","—Yes, and then if you took a circle in a heavy sea you would smash your boats together. I do not think it would do very well.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",83
"84","46461. The boats require to be so close when you haul in that you would require to have more or less calm sea, or you would injure the boats and perhaps the men ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",84
"85","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",85
"86","46462. In any case, it would require to be a boat that could be handled with the oars ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",86
"87","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",87
"88","46463. You cannot work your system by sailing alone ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",88
"89","—-No.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",89
"90","46464. You cannot make your circle ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",90
"91","—We could make a circle, but we could not go about it altogether with the sail.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",91
"92","46465. You just go about the loch, and when you find a place where to all appearance there are fish you sweep it with the net?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",92
"93","—Yes, just circle the net about, and draw it in towards the boat again till we have them as in a bag.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",93
"94","46466. Of course the screws, the buyers, are more numerous every year ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",94
"95","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",95
"96","46467. Do you remember the time when there was more delay in sending off fish ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",96
"97","—Yes, there were only the luggage boats.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",97
"98","46468. And you could not send the fish then so fresh?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",98
"99","—No, they might go fresh enough, but they would not be so early in the market.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",99
"100","46469. And you did not get near so much for them?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",100
"101","—No, we did not get so much for them.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",101
"102","46470. So the reason for the success of the fishing in recent years is just that you take more fish ashore and get more money for them?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",102
"103","—Yes, although I have seen us take in as much fish in former times.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",103
"104","46471. How long is it since you commenced trawling?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",104
"105","—About thirtytwo years.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",105
"106","46472. But it was not legalised ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",106
"107","—There was a stop put to it since that time.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",107
"108","46473. But now for the last sixteen years you have been allowed to trawl ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",108
"109","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",109
"110","46474. But for some years before that you did not trawl except at the risk of your liberty ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",110
"111","—Yes, we were prohibited.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",111
"112","46475. The Chairman.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",112
"113","—The previous witness said there were more herring brought on to the shore than were lifted out in the sea; is it the case in your opinion that there are more drawn to the shore than are taken out into your boat?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",113
"114","—There are more drawn to the shore. In drawing to the shore we get more of them when we get to the shallow water.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",114
"115","46476. But is the net not more liable to be injured when drawn to the shore than when drawn in deep water ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",115
"116","—Yes, but we generally lift them out where they hardly catch the ground.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",116
"117","46477. Is the whole of the shore along here quite clear for the fishermen Can they draw where they like?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",117
"118","—No, there are some rocks and foul ground that they cannot get near.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",118
"119","46478. But I mean is there any restriction on the part of the proprietor, or does he allow you to draw wherever you like ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",119
"120","—Yes. I may say there is nothing to stop us here; there is no restriction.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",120
"121","46479. Are there any stake nets for salmon along the shore?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",121
"122","—Yes, there are some.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",122
"123","46480. How do you manage with them ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",123
"124","—We do not go near them. They are inside of where we draw. We work outside the stake.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",124
"125","46481. But when you draw on the beach?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",125
"126","—We do not draw so near in as the stake boats. ",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",126
"127","46482. In fact, there is no difficulty about stake nets ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",127
"128","—None at all.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",128
"129","46483. Do you ever catch salmon in the herring nets?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",129
"130","—No.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",130
"131","46484. You never catch salmon by accident?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",131
"132","—Well, we will see one at an odd time, but very seldom. A man may be working all his days and never see a salmon in a trawl net.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",132
"133","46485. There are a great number of boats in the loch, and they come from different quarters; is there any kind of understanding or arrangement that the boats from one place shall take one part of the loch and the boats from another place shall take another, or does everybody go where he likes ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",133
"134","—Just where he likes. There are boats from Ardrishaig, and we draw side by side on the shore; and those coming from Campbeltown do the same.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",134
"135","46486. Is there ever any conflict or quarrel between boats from different places that want to fish on the same spot ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",135
"136","—There is that among ourselves whiles.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",136
"137","46487. Who regulates that? Who keeps you all in order?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",137
"138","—It very often goes out in smoke. We do not say much about it.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",138
"139","46488. Then there is no practical difficulty about each party finding their ground and taking their fish—no confusion ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",139
"140","—None in the least.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",140
"141","46489. You said that boats are generally bought by people at once; I suppose a man will sometimes sell a share of a boat to another man?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",141
"142","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",142
"143","46490. Is there a good deal of that sort of buying and selling shares of boats ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",143
"144","—Yes, very often at the hinder end of every year a good deal of it.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",144
"145","46491. Is there any speculation; does the share of the boat rise and fall like the share of the company or mine?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",145
"146","—According to the notion the man has of the boat; if he is going to keep her or give her up. Very often",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",146
"147","some are kept up high and some are not.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",147
"148","46492. But does a man ever buy or sell a share of a boat as a speculation?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",148
"149","—No.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",149
"150","46493. When he buys a share of a boat he expects to work it?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",150
"151","—He expects to work it.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",151
"152","46494. There is no stock-jobbing or speculation ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",152
"153","—No; there is not any money-making business in that way.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",153
"154","46495. Are the boats insured ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",154
"155","—I do not think any of them are insured. I never heard of it.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",155
"156","46496. You never heard of anybody insuring his boat ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",156
"157","—No. They might have it insured for all I know, but I never heard of it.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",157
"158","46497. Is there any insurance of life; do the men ever insure their own lives?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",158
"159","—I do not believe many of them insure their lives here.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",159
"160","46498. Do you think there is anybody who does it?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",160
"161","—There may be a few, but it is not known if there is.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",161
"162","46499. Has it ever been the practice, with reference to their families, for people to insure their lives in the fishing industry ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",162
"163","—Well, there are some who have their lives insured, but I think it is the fewest number.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",163
"164","46500. Then, in regard to the loss of boats, is there any system of mutual insurance or mutual assistance by which people who lose a boat at sea can buy another ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",164
"165","—No, there is nothing of the sort that I am aware of.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",165
"166","46501. Any club?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",166
"167","—No.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",167
"168","46502. Then I would like to know is there any loss of boats or loss of life here; are there any widows living in this place of men who lost their lives at the fishing ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",168
"169","—Yes, there are one or two; there are very few of them. We are very fortunate that way. Two or three years ago there was a sad accident in the loch here, about two or two and a half miles from this place.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",169
"170","46503. Were the boats run down by a steamer?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",170
"171","—No, it was a squall of wind.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",171
"172","46504. But the loss of a boat or life is very rare ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",172
"173","—-Very rare.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",173
"174","46505. Has the loss of life increased since they have been in the habit of going to the Ayrshire coast ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",174
"175","—No, I cannot say it has.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",175
"176","46506. Suppose the weather to be extremely bad on the Ayrshire coast, and the water to be in such a state that they could not run into the Ayrshire ports, what do they do ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",176
"177","—They have to anchor at the mouth of the harbour till the water rises.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",177
"178","46507. They never run down to Galloway?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",178
"179","—They cannot go to Girvan without a bit of tide.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",179
"180","46508. If they had to run in very bad weather, where would be the nearest place of natural shelter, supposing them to be fishing on the spawning beds ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",180
"181","—Ballantrae is the only place they can run to at all. Sometimes they run to Loch Ryan.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",181
"182","46509. Do they run to Loch Ryan ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",182
"183","—Yes, if the wind favours them.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",183
"184","46510. But the west wind would not favour them ?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",184
"185","—No.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",185
"186","46511. They could not get down?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",186
"187","—No. I believe if there was a right north-west wind and them on the banks, most of them would be ashore. I think they would have to run ashore as a last remedy.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",187
"188","46512. We were told yesterday that they were putting half decks upon their twenty-five feet boats. They are doing that in the fore part?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",188
"189","—Yes.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",189
"190","46513. You draw the net in to the side?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",190
"191","—Into the middle of the boat.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",191
"192","46514. Why should they not have a half deck at each end?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",192
"193","—They have the net in the stern when they take it on board ready for shooting again, and the aft deck would be in the way.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",193
"194","46515. Does the deck in front make the boat any safer, or is it simply for shelter?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",194
"195","—Not a bit safer —just for shslter.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",195
"196","46516. Is there anything that occurs to you that would make the fishing better, or is it just going as well as possible?",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",196
"197","—I think it is going on pretty fair, only we would like to get a weekly close time, and boxes of a certain size.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",197
"198","46517. Sheriff Nicolson.",746,"John Macmillan","Argyll, Tarbert",198
