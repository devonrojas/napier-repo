"1","SAMUEL NICOLSON, Crofter, Balmeanach—examined. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",1
"2","139. The Chairman.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",2
"3","—Before I take the examination of Samuel Nicolson, I understand it is the desire of Mr Macdonald to say something further. Mr Macdonald.—I wish to say, in ease of any misapprehension, that all witnesses have the very fullest opportunity of saying whatever they choose, true or false,—I leave it to themselves,—without any fear of anything whatever from anybody. I was rather taken aback at first, and was not prepared at the instant, or else I would have said that, but now I say it fully. Witness.—I understand what is said.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",3
"4","140 The Chairman.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",4
"5","—Have you been present during the examination of Angus Stewart?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",5
"6","—Yes. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",6
"7","141. Did you hear and understand everything that passed?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",7
"8","—I heard and understood everything that was said. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",8
"9","142. Will you be so good as to make any statement on your own part corroborative or otherwise of what you have heard from Angus Stewart? ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",9
"10","—He was quite right in all he said. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",10
"11","143. Have you anything additional to state?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",11
"12","—I would say somewhat differently from what he said in some things. As he said, we were very much crowded by other people being placed in our township—strangers,— and we were also in trouble through our holdings being made smaller and the rents increased. We have particular cause for speaking in our own interest as regards the hill of Benlee which was taken from us. I can point out to the present day the sheilings which the women had in my grandfather's time on the hill, and  we were looking upon it that we had full right of the grazing on Benlee. Fifty-four years ago the then factor sent a ground officer from Sleat all the way to make up the summing of the hill for us, and that officer is still living, and it is he who told me about it. We were also much hampered by families from other townships being crowded in among us, and part of our land taken from us for their accommodation, without reduction of rent. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",12
"13","144. Can you state, within your own memory, within the last thirty or forty years, about how many families have been brought in from different ptaces around and crowded in upon the soil of the Braes ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",13
"14","—I am free to say that there are twenty such families at any rate. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",14
"15","145. Within the last thirty or forty years?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",15
"16","—Yes, within my own memory—that is within the last thirty or forty years. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",16
"17","146. When the families are brought in and the land is divided, is there a fair reduction of rent made to the parties from whom the land is taken to be given to the new comers?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",17
"18","—Not a penny of reduction in the township in which I live. There was no reduction. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",18
"19","147. What rent then do the new families pay? Are they charged rent?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",19
"20","—Yes. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",20
"21","148. Do they pay the rent to the proprietor or to the old crofter?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",21
"22","— To the landlord. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",22
"23","149. We have heard of the formation of a deer forest from the last witness; how long is it since the deer forest was formed ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",23
"24","—Thirty or thirty-one years ago. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",24
"25","150. When the deer forest was formed, were there any inhabitants brought from that ground and put upon the ground of the Braes ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",25
"26","—There were some of them who got no land and others went abroad. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",26
"27","151. Did any come to the Braes?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",27
"28","—Yes. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",28
"29","152. To make the deer forest, was any pasture taken away from the Braes people or any other crofters?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",29
"30","—I understand that grazing was taken from the tenants of Sconser for the purpose of the deer forest, but not from the tenants of the Braes. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",30
"31","153. Mr Cameron.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",31
"32","—You say that the holdings were made smaller, and that the rents were increased; when was that?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",32
"33","—It is seventeen years since the township in which I live was made smaller. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",33
"34","154. Do you mean that the common grazing was taken away?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",34
"35","—The arable land. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",35
"36","155. Was the rent increased upon the remainder?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",36
"37","—The rent was not increased on the township in which I live, but the hill was taken from us and that lot of arable land. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",37
"38","156. Did the rent remain the same after the arable land was taken away and also the hill ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",38
"39","—Yes, the rent remained the same. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",39
"40","157. Who got the arable land?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",40
"41","—One of the tenants who was taken from Scor. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",41
"42","158. What do you mean by one?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",42
"43","—One family. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",43
"44","159. Do you speak of the hill as regards your township or as regards your particular farm?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",44
"45","—It was of our own particular township that I speak. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",45
"46","160. Then there was only one family that came?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",46
"47","—From Scor, and another stranger came, but he was instated in another man's place in our township. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",47
"48","161. How many crofts are there in your township?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",48
"49","—Twenty-four. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",49
"50","162. Then, before this time that you are talking of, there were twenty-three?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",50
"51","—I believe it was about that. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",51
"52","163. And only one family came, and the holdings of the other crofters were reduced by the extent of one twenty-fourth ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",52
"53","—Yes; that is so. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",53
"54","164. And the rents remained the same?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",54
"55","—The rent remained the same. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",55
"56","165. And one more family was added to the twenty-three?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",56
"57","—Yes. There were nine whole lots in our township, and the ninth was taken from us, and that lot was held by the township as vacant ground before the family from Scor got it. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",57
"58","166. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",58
"59","—As pastureground?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",59
"60","—They were taking in that lot every third year. It was fallow ground, and was yielding, I believe, crop of the value of £16. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",60
"61","167. Mr Cameron.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",61
"62","—How many acres of arable ground did this new family get which they occupied and tilled and worked ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",62
"63","—I am not sure whether it is three and a half or four acres that is in our lots. That particular lot was the same size as the others. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",63
"64","168. So there were twenty-three crofters who had the same sized lots?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",64
"65","—Yes. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",65
"66","169. And this one family came and took away the lot?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",66
"67","—Yes. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",67
"68","170. With the right of grazing on the hill?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",68
"69","—That particular lot had no right to the hill grazing. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",69
"70","171. They did not get any hill grazing?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",70
"71","—No, they got no hill grazing; they simply got the arable land. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",71
"72","172. So that the other tweuty-three crofters had their lots as they had them before, and the whole of the hill grazing?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",72
"73","—Yes. There were thirteen lots cut out, but these were occupied by eight families at first. Then they increased till there were two families on each let. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",73
"74","173. But eventually they came to twenty-three?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",74
"75","—Yes, they eventually came to twenty-three families. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",75
"76","174. Of the twenty families who were brought in, when was the last brought in ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",76
"77","—I mean there twenty families taken into the three townships, not into my particular township. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",77
"78","175. I am aware of that, but they were not taken in at the same time?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",78
"79","—No. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",79
"80","176. Then, in what year was the last of these families taken in?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",80
"81","—Fifteen or sixteen years ago.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",81
"82","177. Where did all these twenty families come from?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",82
"83","—Two of them came from Scor to the township in which I am. Another came from Tormichaig. Others of the Tormichaig tenants were placed in Beinna-chorrain, the township which is next to mine. I cannot be very sure altogether from what townships the remainder of these twenty families came, but I believe some of them came from as far away as Nairn.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",83
"84","178. You have accounted for three; do you know of any more?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",84
"85","— Five of the Tormichaig tenants were placed in the two townships. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",85
"86","179. Do you know why these people were shifted from Tormichaig to this township?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",86
"87","—The principal reason I am aware of was that at the time of the Disruption the factor was very much against the Free Church, and some of the families were removed because of sheltering elders of the Free Church. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",87
"88","180. In Tormichaig?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",88
"89","—Tormichaig and Kenchreggan, which is a township near Tormichaig. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",89
"90","181. From the point of view of these five families, were they better off in Tormichaig or better off where they came to?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",90
"91","—They themselves were saying that they were very much better off where they came from, and they were very much lamenting their removal. As to those who were removed from Tormichaig I do not know, but they were removed for a deer forest. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",91
"92","182. Is Tormichaig in the neighbourhood of a deer forest ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",92
"93","—Yes. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",93
"94","183. Had they any grazing which is now a deer forest?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",94
"95","—Yes. The township of Tormichaig had their grazings in what is now part of the deer forest as well as the arable land of Tormichaig. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",95
"96","184. So you think they were removed partly for sheltering the elders and partly to make a deer forest?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",96
"97","—That is the best opinion I can give. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",97
"98","185. Professor Mackinnon.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",98
"99","—You stated that there are twenty-three families in your township, and that there were originally only eight lots. Has each of the twenty-three a lot now? Does each of the twenty-three pay rent now to the proprietor?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",99
"100","—Yes, each of these twenty-three families is paying rent to the landlord besides cottars. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",100
"101","186. Are there twenty-three crofters and cottars besides without any land at all ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",101
"102","—The twenty-three include the cottars as well as the crofters. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",102
"103","187. Are they all paying the same rent ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",103
"104","—No, they are not paying the same rent. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",104
"105","188. The crofters ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",105
"106","—The crofters pay much about the same rent. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",106
"107","189. Then, of the twenty-three, how many are crofters and how many cottars ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",107
"108","—Two or three are cottars ; but each family does not pay the same rent. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",108
"109","190. What is the highest rent that is paid by any one crofter?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",109
"110","—The lot in which I lived was paying £10, 5s. before the rent of Benlee was put on; but there are two or three families on the lot. I myself pay £5, 3s. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",110
"111","191. Sheriff Nicolson.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",111
"112","—How much for Benlee?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",112
"113","—Thirty-two shillings and a few pence. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",113
"114","192. Professor Mackinnon.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",114
"115","—You say the croft is divided into two. If it were a £10 croft would you think that a good sized croft?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",115
"116","—When the township had one family on each croft and the whole pasture besides they were making a living. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",116
"117","193. What is the stock of a double croft? What stock is it allowed to keep ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",117
"118","—Four or five cows. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",118
"119","194. For the whole £10?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",119
"120","—Yes, but they got leave from the then factor to keep six cows. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",120
"121","195. Sheriff Nicolson.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",121
"122","—Before Benlee was taken from them ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",122
"123","—Before Benlee was taken from us. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",123
"124","196. Professor Mackinnon.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",124
"125","—And the number of sheep?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",125
"126","—To the best of my recollection eighteen sheep. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",126
"127","197. That is without the hill ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",127
"128","—We could keep thirty-six sheep on each lot, when we had the hilL ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",128
"129","198. Six cows and thirty-six sheep. Do you consider that size of croft a suitable size, or would you prefer it to be bigger ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",129
"130","—I would prefer a bigger croft if I could get it. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",130
"131","199. What would you consider a suitable size of croft in this place?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",131
"132","— I think that one crofter should make a living out of eight acres of ground with grazing. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",132
"133","200. Grazing for how many cattle, and how many sheep and horses?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",133
"134","— Four or five cows, forty or fifty sheep, and one horse. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",134
"135","201. Is there any horse kept in the place?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",135
"136","—We are allowed to keep a horse. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",136
"137","202. But has each crofter a horse?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",137
"138","—No, each crofter has not a horse. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",138
"139","203. Then, supposing you had that croft you speak of, capable of maintaining four or five cows, a horse, and fifty sheep, could you see your way to stock it ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",139
"140","—Not now; I could not stock such a croft now. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",140
"141","204. Are there many in the place who, you think, could do so?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",141
"142","—I do not think there are many who could stock it. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",142
"143","205. As rents are going in the place just now, what do you think should be the rent of such a croft ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",143
"144","—In my opinion £5 or £6 would be quite enough. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",144
"145","206. That is to say the rents at present are too high?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",145
"146","—The rents at present are too high. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",146
"147","207. But though you consider them too high, what would be the rent of such a croft as rents are going just now?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",147
"148","—I cannot say, as I have no experience. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",148
"149","208. Do you think the rents are too high just now, on this estate?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",149
"150","— Yes, I consider the rents are too high on this estate. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",150
"151","209. And you think a rent of £5 or £6 for such a croft would be reasonable?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",151
"152","—I do not think that the rent which I named would be dear for such a lot. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",152
"153","210. Do you think it would be cheap ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",153
"154","—I think a man could make a good living out of it. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",154
"155","211. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",155
"156","—I think you said you were something of a fisherman. Do you think it would benefit you considerably to have some quays where boats could run into?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",156
"157","—I believe in my own township a great deal of money is lost through the want of a quay. They have to go elsewhere with their fish to sell them, though it is considered that is the best place for disposing of their fish to the fish-curers.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",157
"158","212. Could such quays be erected at a moderate expense?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",158
"159","—I do not think there is a place thereabouts where a quay could be easier constructed than in my own township of Balmeanach. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",159
"160","213. Would you be willing to pay a reasonable rent for the accommodation of such a quay ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",160
"161","—Yes, as I see is being paid for accommodation at other quays. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",161
"162","214. Is the fishing here a moderate degree of fishing all over the year, or is it at certain periods of the year that there is fishing opposite Bahneanach ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",162
"163","—There is fishing to be got for the most part during the whole year, except a month or two in the spring time—herring fishing. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",163
"164","215. They wouid not have to go very far away from the shore, I presume ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",164
"165","—No, they would not have to go far from the shore. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",165
"166","216. And of course no distance from their own dwellings?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",166
"167","—No distance from their own dwellings. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",167
"168","217. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",168
"169","—Would a quay of itself be an advantage although no curer established himself at Balmeanach?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",169
"170","—We need the quay principally for the purposes of the fishing. We could do without the quay so far as our other purposes are concerned. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",170
"171","218. And if no curer were there it would be of little advantage?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",171
"172","— There is no year in which a curer does not come—four of them. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",172
"173","219. Where to?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",173
"174","—To our township of Balmeanach. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",174
"175","220. Can your boats land in all weathers ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",175
"176","—We cannot draw our boats up in all weathers. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",176
"177","221. Sheriff Nicolson.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",177
"178","—Are there often such days?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",178
"179","—Every second week almost we cannot draw up our boats. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",179
"180","222. What sort of land have you in Balmeanach ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",180
"181","—Bad land. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",181
"182","223. What kind?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",182
"183","—The half of it consists of a depth of two inches of soil on rocks. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",183
"184","224. How long does your crop of potatoes generally last you?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",184
"185","—My whole crop of potatoes and corn will not sustain my family for one-third part of the year.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",185
"186","225. Was the potato crop a failure last year ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",186
"187","—Yes, the potato crop was a failure last season. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",187
"188","226. Have you got any assistance here ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",188
"189","—Yes, we got some assistance. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",189
"190","227. Are you satisfied with the mode in which it was distributed?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",190
"191","— I think so; I think we are satisfied with the way in which it was divided. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",191
"192","228. Is there any rich person in the Braes ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",192
"193","—I am not aware of any. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",193
"194","229. Do you know of any who has money in the bank ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",194
"195","—Yes, I know a few ; I know some who have a little money in the bank. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",195
"196","230. The Chairman.",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",196
"197","—You stated that the croft belonging to your family was divided. Why was it divided?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",197
"198","—The father of my predecessor in the lot gave the half of it to his son by order of the factor. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",198
"199","231. Was it divided against the wish of the family or by the wish of the family?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",199
"200","—It was with the wish of the family that the croft was divided. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",200
"201","232. During your occupancy has your rent been increased ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",201
"202","—No, it has not increased. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",202
"203","233. What do you sell off the croft to get money ? Do you sell a stirk or a lamb, or what ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",203
"204","—Some years I sell one stirk and perhaps two sheep, and some years I am not able to sell anything at alL ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",204
"205","234. Has the value of the stock or animals you sell increased or decreased during your occupancy?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",205
"206","—The price of stock rose about the time I got the lot, or shortly before I got it. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",206
"207","235. Are the prices now, in the present year, higher than they were at the time you got the lot ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",207
"208","—Much about the same. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",208
"209","236 Do you sell any butter?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",209
"210","—Never. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",210
"211","237 Or anything else off the croft?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",211
"212","—Nothing, I am not able to sell any of the produce of the croft other than the stock, but I am under the necessity always of buying. I have spent £18 this year upon meal alone. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",212
"213","238. Are the prices of commodities necessary for your family dearer now than at the time when you entered into possession of your croft ?",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",213
"214","— Yes. ",4,"Samuel Nicolson","Skye, Braes",214
