"4","—Yes.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",4
"5","17290. Who called the Balallan people together to elect you?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",5
"6","—Those who were going among the people from out of Stornoway.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",6
"7","17291. Who were those ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",7

"11","17293. Were there any strangers present?—No, they were all of the island.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",11
"12","—Statement of Balallan People. We beg to lay before the Commissioners the way in which Balallan has been so badly ruled. ",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",12
"13","1. About forty-four years ago, when Mr John Knox was chamberlain here, he took Kintarvay, or part of our hill pasture, from us, and joined it with sporting grounds of Aline. ",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",13
"14","2. Sixteen crofters were placed among us when the Park tenants were displaced. ",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",14
"15","3. Mr John Scoby, "" Factor,"" formed the village of Arivruach, west from Balallan on our hill pasture, without allowing any discount in our rents. ",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",15
"16","4. When Mr John Mackenzie became factor he divided Balallan into sixty-four crofts, and increased the rents. ",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",16
"17","5. Mr Donald Munro also increased our rents. ",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",17
"18","6. When Mr William M'Kay became factor we got some hill pasture from him, and also a place to cut our peats in. ",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",18
"19","7. We now entreat that, by the favour of Lady Matheson and Mr William Mackay, all the squatters (people without crofts, thirty-two in number) will be removed, or places given to them, as they are an entire burden on the tenants, as also high rents and taxes.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",19
"20","—JOHN SMITH, senior, DONALD MARTIN, ALEXANDER M'KENZIE, JOHN MACLEOD, JOHN SMITH, junior.'",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",20

"22","—£153.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",22
"23","17295. What is the rent to-day ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",23

"27","17297. Does it include the road money and the kain money?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",27
"28","—Yes, it includes that.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",28
"29","17298. Is that the increase made by Mr Munro to which reference is here made ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",29
"30","—That was the only permanent rise of rent that he imposed. There were temporary impositions. In one case the rent was doubled because one kept a married son.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",30
"31","17299. How many lots were there before the place was lotted under Mr John Mackenzie ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",31
"32","—There were twenty-six lots when Sir James Matheson bought the property.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",32
"33","17300. How many families were living on the twenty-six lots?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",33
"34","—There were a few of them that had two families upon them.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",34
"35","17301. There were not two families upon each?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",35
"36","—No, only upon a few.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",36
"37","17302. Were these families brought in from other places after the lotting by Mr John Mackenzie?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",37
"38","—No, there were none brought in from the outside since Mr Mackenzie lotted the place. There was a large number shortly before that, and there were additions made to the lots by Mr Mackenzie by giving lots to some of the people of the place.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",38
"39","17303. There were sixty-four families in the place when it was lotted out into sixty-four crofts?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",39
"40","—Yes.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",40
"41","17304. Well, there are now thirty-two squatters in the place. Where have they come from ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",41
"42","—They grew upon the place—the natural increase of the place.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",42
"43","17305. And there is not room in the place for them?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",43
"44","—No, there is no place for them. They are a burden to the place, and they injure it very much.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",44
"45","17306. Have you any of your own family burdening the place?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",45
"46","—Yes.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",46
"47","17307. Where do you want your family to be put that are burdening the place ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",47
"48","—We don't know very well. We used to consider America as the place to go to, but now, through the favour of Lady Matheson and her representative Mr Mackay, we think that a place might be provided for them in the land of their birth.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",48
"49","17308. If they got assistance to go to America, with promise of some provision on their arrival there, would they be inclined still to go to America?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",49
"50","—I don't think they would. There were many of our relatives who went to America, and we have not heard such favourable accounts of how they got on.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",50
"51","17309. Have any of them come home from America?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",51
"52","—No; they had not the means to bring them home.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",52
"53","17310. Did they write letters to say so?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",53
"54","—Yes. My father was the only one of my grandfather's family who did not emigrate, and the arrangement they made with him when they went away was—' Don't stir from where you are till we send for you,' and he never got a letter from them but the tenor of it was—' If you are as well off as you were when we left you, don't stir out of it.'",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",54
"55","17311. How long is it since you last heard from them ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",55
"56","—I heard from a son of my own not very long ago, and a sister of my own. There was an unmarried nephew of my own who came across here some years ago, and stayed with me for a while, and returned back again, and I heard from him too.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",56
"57","17312. Why did he return ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",57
"58","—To support his father and mother. They had no means of support without him.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",58
"59","17313. Where were they living?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",59
"60","—In Canada—I cannot specify further—but he used to tell me this, that when people gathered together from all parts, the Highland people as they are here to-day, the burden of their conversation was the old homes they had left behind them, and they all say that if they could they would return back again. ",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",60
"61","17314. Had your relatives land of their own in Canada?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",61
"62","—Yes.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",62
"63","17315. Were they not living comfortably upon that land?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",63
"64","—Sometimes they might be pretty comfortable. I met with a trustworthy man who went away at the same time, John M'Leod by name, and when I asked him about my sister and her husband, his reply was that my sister and her husband did not get much satisfaction or comfort in America. They were but young at the time, and the proof of their discomfort he gave me was that their heads were as white as a seagull, mourning for the land they had left behind.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",64
"65","17316. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",65
"66","—Was your nephew born in America?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",66
"67","—No, he was born at Kershader.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",67
"68","17317. How old was he when he left ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",68
"69","—Fourteen or fifteen years of age.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",69
"70","17318. Is there much fishing in this loch now ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",70
"71","—There used to be when herring came into it. There is very little fishing except when there are herring.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",71
"72","17319. Do you know the reason why the herring are not coming now?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",72
"73","—Providence—the administration of the Creator.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",73
"74","17320. About sixteen families came from Park. What was the object of sending them out ? Was it then created a tack for the first time, or was it an enlargement of a tack ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",74
"75","—Clearing Park in order to place it undersheep.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",75
"76","17321. Who was the person who got the place?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",76
"77","—Archibald and Alexander Stewart, two brothers.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",77
"78","17322. Were you yourself born in Balallan, or were you in Park at one time?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",78
"79","—I was born in Park, in a place called Eesgin of Park.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",79
"80","17323. How old were you when you left ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",80
"81","—About fifteen.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",81
"82","17324. Was your father one of those who were removed?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",82
"83","—He was one of those who were sent away from the place.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",83
"84","17325. Was your father well off when he lived in Park?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",84
"85","—Yes, as well as a crofter tenant might need to ask.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",85
"86","17326. Was it for his benefit to be removed?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",86
"87","—Quite the contrary, but because of the oppression of the people—dealt with as a herd of sheep driven by dogs into a fank.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",87
"88","17327. Were the other people who were removed like your father in comfortable circumstances ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",88
"89","—Yes. Nobody needed to leave the place from one year's end to another for anything the family required. If one family happened to be short of provisions, they had only to ask their neighbour, who could supply them.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",89
"90","17328. Had the removal of those families a prejudicial effect on their circumstances—tending to impoverish them ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",90
"91","—Nobody stood it so well as my father did. He had means, and he got into a place until he was banished a second time.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",91
"92","17329. Where did he go the first time?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",92
"93","—He came to another portion of Park called Cleater, over upon the other side of the loch from Balallan.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",93
"94","17330. How long was he there before he was removed ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",94
"95","—He had Cleater to himself for nine years, and then another man was put in who got two-thirds of it, and my father for five years had one-third. He was fourteen years there altogether.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",95
"96","17331. What became of him then ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",96
"97","—He was one of the sixteen who were removed to Balallan when Mr Scott became tenant of Park. This was before Sir James Matheson's day.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",97
"98","17332. They had to clear out of Park and go to Balallan?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",98
"99","—Yes, those of them who were not sent off to America. Others of them were sent to Tongue, down near Stornoway.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",99
"100","17333. Is there a ground officer living here ? ",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",100
"101","—Yes.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",101
"102","17334. What land has he got?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",102
"103","—He has net very much land—about two lots.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",103

"105","—Yes.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",105
"106","17336. Was that croft cut out of your township at that time?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",106
"107","—It was made before he got it. It was cut out at the time Mr Mackenzie portioned out the place into lots.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",107
"108","17337. Was any allowance made to crofters for the cutting out of these two lots to the grouud officer ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",108
"109","—No ; the arrangement was this, that the rent of the township was apportioned out among the lots, these two lots paying their share of the rent as well as ourselves.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",109
"110","17338. Does that so remain ?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",110
"111","—Yes.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",111
"112","17339. Has the ground officer any privilege over your township which none of the other crofters possess?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",112
"113","—Nothing whatever; he is just as another neighbour.John Smith was recalled later in the day for two supplementary questions",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",113
"114","17713. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",114
"115","—Do you know how many families were removed from Park at different times?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",115

"117","17714. What would the average number of each family be?",316,"John Smith","Lewis, Keose",117
