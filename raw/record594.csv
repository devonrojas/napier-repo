"1","JOHN MACDONALD, Master Mariner, Tobermory (45)—examined.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",1
"2","35840. The Chairman.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",2
"3","—How long have you been resident at Tobermory?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",3
"4","—Nineteen years.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",4
"5","35841. Are there many of the young people going to sea from here?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",5
"6","—A good number.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",6
"7","35842. You perhaps heard the previous witness saying there were not so many as there used to be; is that your experience ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",7
"8","—There are not nearly so many.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",8
"9","35843. What do you attribute that to?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",9
"10","—I don't know; mostly all the young people at one time went to the sea, and now a great many of them don't.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",10
"11","35844.  Is it owing to their finding it easier to get profitable occupation  elsewhere ; is there more work going, so that there is less necessity to  go to sea ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",11
"12","—I don't know indeed what is the reason for it ; some of them thought they would get on better at other work than at sea.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",12
"13","35845. But do the people generally dislike the profession of the sea; are they averse to it?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",13
"14","—No, I don't think it.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",14
"15","35846.  What is your opinion of the condition of seafaring men compared with  what it was when you were younger; do you think they are better off now  or the contrary?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",15
"16","—Their wages are better, and they are better fed.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",16
"17","35847. And is the class of vessels in which they go to sea more comfortable and superior ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",17
"18","—The vessels are far more comfortable and superior than they were thirty or forty, or even twenty years ago",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",18
"19","—the accommodation is better. ",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",19
"20","35848. The seafaring class as it now exists are better paid and better treated than they were ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",20
"21","—They are better paid and have far better food than what they had before.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",21
"22","35849.  Is there anything here connected with the harbour of Tobermory that you  can suggest that could be done for the place, or do you possess  everything necessary for trade ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",22
"23","—I don't see that anything could be done ; the only quay where anything is wanted is in the possession of",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",23
"24","Mr  Caldwell, the proprietor, and he charges heavy dues. It is a profitable  investment for him, and I think it is he who ought to make any addition  to it. The steamboat pier is rather small, but the other pier is ample.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",24
"25","35850. Do you consider the charges at the pier are unreasonably high ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",25
"26","—Well, I think they are paying him very well at any rate.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",26
"27","35851. Did he build the pier?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",27
"28","—He did.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",28
"29","35852. Then he may have built it at some risk?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",29
"30","—It was a certain profit, the trade was good at the time and increasing.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",30
"31","35853. Is the trade still increasing ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",31
"32","—Yes.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",32
"33","35854. Are there any fishing boats of a superior class belonging to this place ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",33
"34","—There are very few fishing boats belonging to the place.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",34
"35","35855. Has the place any natural advantages for fishing?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",35
"36","—No.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",36
"37","35856. Is it not worth considering as a fishing station ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",37
"38","—Not  as a fishing station. It has been tried, and proved a failure. It is  too far from the herring fishing ground, and any other fishing is only a  little at certain seasons of the year.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",38
"39","35857. As we  had not an opportunity of examining you previously we would like to hear  your opinion about the encouragement which could be afforded to fishing  on the island of Skye. I would like first to ask you where you think on  the island various harbour works might be judiciously undertaken—where  could small harbours be formed for the encouragement of the fishing ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",39
"40","—There are several places on the west side of Skye where harbours are much needed for fishing boats, but not for anything else.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",40
"41","35858. Is there any place in Skye where harbour works of a more important character could be profitably undertaken?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",41
"42","—No.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",42
"43","35859. Portree and other places offer sufficient natural advantages for a harbour?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",43
"44","—Yes;  they have ample accommodation for any trade there is already on the  east side, but there are several places suitable for fishing stations on  the west side.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",44
"45","35860. I was rather speaking of large  harbours at present; but you say there are several places on the west  side of Skye where shelters might be made for fishing boats ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",45
"46","—Yes.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",46
"47","35861. What is the kind of work that it would be necessary to make?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",47
"48","—It  would need to be a place which would shelter their boats so that they  would not be under the necessity of hauling them up, and where they  could keep a better class of boats. They can only have small boats",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",48
"49","at  present, which they can haul up every night; and they would need small  piers to shelter them, to enable them to keep larger boats.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",49
"50","35862. Almost all the Skye boats are hauled up every night?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",50
"51","—The most of them on the west of Skye.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",51
"52","35863. I suppose you contemplate a better class of boats ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",52
"53","—A rather better class of boats, so that they could go a longer distance to the fishing, and with more safety.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",53
"54","35864. What size of boats would you recommend ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",54
"55","—For  the cod and ling fishing boats of about twenty-four or twenty-five feet  of keel. That is the principal fishing upon the west side of Skye,  combined with the lobster fishing.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",55
"56","35865. Would these boats be decked?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",56
"57","—Not at all.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",57
"58","35866.  They want boats of twenty-four or twenty-five feet of keel for the home  fishing; but would the Skye people, if they had larger boats, not go to  Barra and to the east coast?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",58
"59","—I believe they would, or follow the fishing on the west coast of Scotland or Ireland.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",59
"60","35867. To greater distances ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",60
"61","—Yes, if they had bigger boats; but very few of them are able to get these.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",61
"62","35868. What class of boats would these be ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",62
"63","—They would need boats of from thirty to fifty tons for that fishing.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",63
"64","35869. How many feet of keel would that be?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",64
"65","—From thirty-five to forty-five or forty-eight feet of keel.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",65
"66","35870. In fact, the kind of boats used on the east coast and in Shetland ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",66
"67","—Yes.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",67
"68","35871. Then they would require two classes of boats?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",68
"69","—They would.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",69
"70","35872.  One of about twenty-four or twenty-five feet of keel, an open boat; and  the other a big decked boat of thirty-five to forty-five feet of keel ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",70
"71","—Yes.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",71
"72","35873. If they had boats of that kind they could prosecute their fishing with advantage ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",72
"73","—They  could to the same advantage as people from any other part of the  country, and to better advantage, because they could always use them in  winter when they were not at the herring fishing.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",73
"74","35874. Would the boats of twenty-four or twenty-five feet of keel be hauled up on shore ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",74
"75","—They have to be at the present time.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",75
"76","35875. But it is not desirable to do it ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",76
"77","—No.  It is a tremendous labour, and sometimes they cannot very well do it  when they come in at low water. Having only beats of from seventeen to  eighteen feet keel, they haul them up, but with larger boats that would  be very difficult.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",77
"78","35876. Is the larger class of boats, between thirty-five and forty-five feet of keel, hauled up ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",78
"79","—Not unless for the winter.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",79
"80","35877. It always lies out?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",80
"81","—Yes, unless it is laid up for the winter.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",81
"82","35878.  What kind of works would it be necessary to make on the west coast of  Skye in order to protect and shelter boats of these two classes ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",82
"83","—For  the larger class there is ample natural harbours, at a distance though;  but there is no fishing near hand, and they would have to come home  with the boats. There are ample natural harbours on the west coast of  Skye; it is principally harbours for the middle class of boats that  would be needed.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",83
"84","35879. For the boats of twenty-four and twenty-five feet of keel?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",84
"85","—Yes.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",85
"86","35880. But the larger boats of thirty-five or forty-five feet of keel would be used as herring boats at one time of the year?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",86
"87","—Yes, on all occasions.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",87
"88","35881.  Supposing that these brought home their herrings to Skye, to the native  place of the fishermen, would they require a pier to land the fish, or  could the fish be taken out of the large boat and transported on shore",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",88
"89","by a small boat ? ",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",89
"90","—Yes, or the piers for the small boats would do for the big boats to come alongside of at high water.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",90
"91","35882. That would be sufficient?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",91
"92","—Quite sufficient.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",92
"93","35883. What kind of works would it be necessary to form to shelter these boats of twenty-four or twenty-five feet of keel?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",93
"94","—It  depends greatly on the formation of the place. In some places they  would need to be more extensive than in others. Some of the places,  where the shores run out shallow to a considerable distance, would need a  long projecting pier, in order to give two or three feet of depth at  low water of springtides. ",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",94
"95","35884. You don't speak of a pier parallel to the shore, but of a pier standing out at right angles ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",95
"96","—Yes, or from the side of the bay, or may be with a little turn at the end, so as to be a protection from the sea.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",96
"97","35885.  Of course, the length of this would vary according to the ground ; but  can you give me any idea how much they would generally cost—£1000 or  £5000 ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",97
"98","—Very few of them would cost £1000. A few would cost £1200  or £1500, where the water was shallow, and they would require to be  carried out a considerable distance.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",98
"99","35886. Do you  think that a great deal of good might be done at several places on the  west coast of Skye by the erection of piers which would not cost more  than from £1000 to £1200 at least?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",99
"100","—It would be a great benefit to the place, and to several other places besides the west of Skye.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",100
"101","35887. Can you indicate the names of the places where you think such piers would be particularly useful ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",101
"102","—Poltiel, Uig, Stein, Soa, Tarskavaig, and Torrin, and at the north-east of the island at Stenschol or Kilmoluaig.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",102
"103","35888. Which is the best of the two ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",103
"104","—Kilmoluaig is the best sheltered. In all the places I have mentioned piers could be easily built.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",104
"105","35889. Is there any place you wish to mention, at Raasay for instance ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",105
"106","—I don't think there are any needed there; they have natural harbours there.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",106
"107","35890. In Rona ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",107
"108","—No; there are good natural harbours there also.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",108
"109","35891. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",109
"110","—On the east side at Point of Sleat?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",110
"111","—There  is no fishing population there except at one place, and it would not be  easy to make a fishing station there. There is a good harbour at  Ardvasar, close to Armadale. At the end of Sleat it would be very  difficult and costly to make a shelter. There is no need for a pier at  Isle Ornsay ; it has a good natural harbour.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",111
"112","35892.  Suppose such shelters were built by the Government or other agency, how  would you propose the piers should be kept up or maintained ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",112
"113","—Get  the fishermen of the place to keep them up. If these piers were  substantially built, there would not be any necessity for keeping up for  a long time to come. The places are pretty well sheltered as it is, but  they",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",113
"114","are not fit to leave boats at for the night.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",114
"115","35893. If such places were built, would the fishermen be disposed to pay some reasonable dues ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",115
"116","—I believe they would.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",116
"117","35894. But the people have not got the class of boats you spoke of. How do you propose that they should be supplied with boats ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",117
"118","—In all these places I don't think they would have great difficulty in getting the middle class of boats.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",118
"119","35895. How about the higher class?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",119
"120","—-It would be impossible for them to get them without assistance.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",120
"121","35896.  If there were these good shelters, do you think fish-curers would come  to these stations and provide boats, and let them to the men, as they do  in Shetland and other places?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",121
"122","—I don't think they would, for  there has not been any extensive herring fishing on that coast in the  early part of the season yet, and it has been very uncertain the times  it has come. It comes in some years, and there may be no fish again for a  number of years after ; the herring fishing is very uncertain there.  The fishing would principally be for lobster and cod and ling ; that is  the only fishing they could prosecute with certainty.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",122
"123","35897. But if the men had these large boats, would not they go to a distance, and have the fish cured in other places ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",123
"124","—They would need to do that.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",124
"125","35898. Mr Cameron.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",125
"126","—Are there any places on the Long Island where harbours or piers might be made with advantage ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",126
"127","—Not  many. The east side of the Long Island is the only place where they  make any fishing, and there is any number of natural harbours there—far  more than ever will be needed. There is one place on the west side of  Harris which is very much in need of a pier —the island of Scarp. There  are about thirty families there who are in want of accommodation.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",127
"128","35899.  Do you think the people of Skye would take advantage of these piers and  harbours if they got them 1 Do you think they would be much more  inclined to fish than they are now ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",128
"129","—I believe they would.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",129
"130","35900.  With regard to the disposition of the people towards fishing, do you  observe any difference between the Skye people and those on the Long  Island or Lewis; are they more or less inclined to fish ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",130
"131","—The fishing ground is nearer to the people of Lewis than to those in Skye.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",131
"132","35901. How far would they require to go from Skye to get good fishing ground ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",132
"133","—It  varies in some places. In some places it is convenient, but it is only a  narrow strip along the shore. The best places I know for cod and ling  is about Loch Eynort, but they have been all turned away.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",133
"134","35902. Do you consider the west coast of Skye preferable to the east coast?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",134
"135","—There  is more fishing ground ; more open sea. The places I have mentioned are  near the fishing grounds, and where there are no right harbours. On the  east side of Skye they have good shelter.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",135
"136","35903. Do  you think there are any places in Skye where it would be worth while for  a fish-curer to go and establish a station, or would the fishermen  require to repair to some other station and fish from there ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",136
"137","—For the herring fishing they would.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",137
"138","35904. But for the cod and ling fishing ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",138
"139","—The fish-curer would come there if the people were on the spot to begin fishing ; but they were not",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",139
"140","allowed —the proprietors would not allow them to sell their fish to anybody else.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",140
"141","35905.  But for the cod and ling fishing the curer would not require to  establish himself there, but only to come and buy the fish ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",141
"142","—Yes.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",142
"143","35906. That would be much simpler than in the case of the herring fishing ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",143
"144","—Yes.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",144
"145","35907. And the people would dry their own cod and ling ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",145
"146","—Yes,  but then there is a great deal of the best fish that go for no use for  the want of communication to get them fresh to the market.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",146
"147","35908. So that as things are at present they could only deal in dried fish ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",147
"148","—That is all; or lobsters.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",148
"149","35909. I suppose on the east coast of Skye they can send them by steamer to Strome Ferry ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",149
"150","—Yes.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",150
"151","35910. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",151
"152","—Don't you think, if the people were inclined to prosecute the fishing, they would require these piers before they could do so ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",152
"153","—For the cod and ling fishing. They would need piers of some description, so that they could get a better class of boats.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",153
"154","35911.  We had in it evidence last Monday from Captain Swinbourne of Eilean  Shona that he worked the fishing from Loch Poltiel, and sent smacks from  there to Harris and along the west coast of the Long Island without any  more pier than there is at present, and as I understood him he was  successful ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",154
"155","—He had three vessels at the fishing. He had a  schooner of about 160 tons, and the "" Moidart"" of 80 tons, and the  ""Pilot ""of 50 tons; but he came back with his fish salted, and only sent  them ashore there to dry.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",155
"156","35912. He salted them on board the smacks ?-",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",156
"157","—Yes, at Rockall and North Faroe and Iceland, and only landed at Poltiel for the benefit of the fine beach. ",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",157
"158","35913. But if he could land, why could not the others land?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",158
"159","—It  is easy landing there for one day, although you could not keep your  boat for a season there without hauling it up every night. They can  generally land. But what is wanted is a place where they could leave  their boats without hauling them up above high-water mark.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",159
"160","35914.  You said the piers if properly built would not need much repair; were  there not piers at all the stations which were established by the  British Fisheries Society ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",160
"161","— Yes.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",161
"162","35915. And have they not all gone to pieces?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",162
"163","—Most  of hem have; but most of them were not built with regard to the  fishing. Most of them were built to suit the interests of individual  proprietors, and in exposed places, where they were not to be of use to  the fishermen—in fact, where there were no fishermen.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",163
"164","35916. But a pier does require a certain amount of looking after to keep it up ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",164
"165","—Yes;  but where I suggest piers might be built the places are partially  sheltered. There was a pier built on the island of Rum by Dr M'Lean, who  came there about forty-eight or forty-nine years ago, and that pier has  had scarcely any repairs since, and there has hardly been a stone  fallen out of i t ; and the place is pretty exposed too. The pier is  built of nothing but dry stone.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",165
"166","35917. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",166
"167","—When we were at Barra we saw a great number of vessels there, numbering 300 or 400, and every one of",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",167
"168","them we were told had come from the east coast. Was not that so ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",168
"169","—Well, there were four or five or six belonging to Barra itself.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",169
"170","35918.  There is nothing to prevent the people of Skye or Long Island fishing  there like the east coast people except the want of boats and harbours ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",170
"171","—That is all.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",171
"172","35919.  Supposing these larger boats were got somewhere, and that these piers  were put up, would the people of Skye and Long Island be able to hold  their own with the people from the east in fishing?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",172
"173","—I think so.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",173
"174","35920. And would not it be a source of great wealth to the people themselves if that was carried out ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",174
"175","—Certainly it would.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",175
"176","35921. Would it not prevent many of them going away to earn wages as labourers in the south ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",176
"177","—It would.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",177
"178","35922. And there would be a certain fishing almost all the year ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",178
"179","—There would be fishing, such as cod and ling, when the herring fishing could not be prosecuted.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",179
"180","35923.  Do you think that the supply of fish has fallen off so far as the sea  is concerned? We have heard of localities where it is falling off?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",180
"181","—I think it is.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",181
"182","35924. The Chairman.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",182
"183","—Do  you think that the lobsters are abusively treated by being fished the  whole year round? Do you think they are wasting them and exterminating  them ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",183
"184","—No.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",184
"185","35925. Do you think lobsters are just as plentiful as ever?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",185
"186","—I  think they are, hereabout. I could not say what time ought to be close  time for them, for they are in spawning season all the year round. There  is not a day in the year but you will get lobsters ready to spawn.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",186
"187","35926. But is there not a legal close season ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",187
"188","—There was some few years ago some talk about it ; but I don't know whether it was put in force or not.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",188
"189","35927.  Even supposing they are spawning all the year round, would if not have  been better to keep up their numbers, and give them rest for four months  ? Fewer would be got, but then the whole number would not be so  seriously diminished ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",189
"190","—I don't know that it would do any good",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",190
"191","35928. You don't think there ought to be any close season for lobsters ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",191
"192","—I don't think there would be any benefit to the lobster; most of the lobster fishermen I hear speak about it say it would not.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",192
"193","35929.  We heard an old fisherman in Bunessan who said they were nearly  exterminated, and if there were a close season they would be renewed. Do  you hear that talked about?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",193
"194","—Not by the fishermen.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",194
"195","35930. Mr Cameron.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",195
"196","—Are there not some lobsters spoiled when caught in hot weather ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",196
"197","—There  are, during carriage to the market. I have known some fishermen who had  a large box sunk at low-water mark of spring tides, and who put all the  lobsters they caught during these months in those boxes, and only sent  them away when the colder weather came.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",197
"198","35931. Did they feed them?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",198
"199","—Occasionally.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",199
"200","35932. What did they give them to eat?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",200
"201","—Fish, and they gained condition while they were in the boxes.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",201
"202","35933. Are those boxes expensive ?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",202
"203","—No ; one of the parties that I saw was a carpenter himself, and he got a kind of drift wood to make boxes,",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",203
"204","and I don't think they would cost more than £1, 10s. or £2. That man said the lobsters gained considerably in condition.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",204
"205","35934. Did any one follow his example?",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",205
"206","—One or two. I know a man named M'Leod in Harris who tried it.",594,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",206
