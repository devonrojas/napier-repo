"1","CHARLES M'LEOD, Crofter and Fisherman, Arnish, Raasay (60)—examined.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",1
"2","7624. The Chairman,",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected a delegate of this place?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",3
"4","—Yes.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",4
"5","7625. Have you got a statement to make on the part of the people whom you represent?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",5
"6","—Yes. It is with the view of getting deliverance from bondage into liberty, that we have come out here to-day. We would take the example from those who were in bondage, and who  were sighing in their bondage, and wishing for liberty. The Israelites before were in bondage, but there was One above who heard the sighing of those in bondage, and fixed the time for coming for their deliverance. We are oppressed with cultivating bad land, which yields no crop, which does not return to us the value of our work. There are many reasons for that, the way the island is circumstanced. In days gone by this island was called the island of the big men—the island of strong men, and it deserved that name. From the days of John M'Gillicallum of Raasay, it was rearing able men, until within the last few generations. They would defend their islands and the islands about. They were raising fighting men in this island to defend their own homestead and the kingdom. And now, what has caused the people of this island to come down to their present condition? I remember from the time of my father, they were rearing their families. My father reared five sons, and now the land which my father had is occupied by three families; two of them are occupying the land which my father had, and each of their families is as heavy as my father's family was. They have no more arable land than my father had. The rent of the township was £18, 10s., and it is now two townships.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",6
"7","7626. Was that the rent of the township, or the rent of your father's croft?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",7
"8","—The £18, 10s. was the rent of the township, and my father had one-fourth of it.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",8
"9","7627. How many families were in it when the rent was £18, 10s.?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",9
"10","—Four.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",10
"11","7628. How many are there in it now?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",11
"12","—There are now seven lots in the township.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",12
"13","7629. But how many families?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",13
"14","—The township is now divided into seven lots, and each of these seven lots is rented at £5 of bare rent, besides rates. Now, how are seven families to be in comfort upon what only supported four families in the days gone by?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",14
"15","7630. You say there are seven lots at £5 each. Are there seven families on these seven lots? Has each family a whole lot?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",15
"16","—When the township was made into seven lots, one man had three of the lots on one side, and there are four lots on the other side, on each of which there is a family.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",16
"17","7631. Then, there are five families altogether?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",17
"18","—Yes.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",18
"19","7632. Leaving out the man who has three lots, and taking the families each of which has one lot, what is the summing of each lot?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",19
"20","—Two cows to each, with their calves. We have no summing.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",20
"21","7633. Have you any sheep?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",21
"22","—We have a few sheep.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",22
"23","7634. About how many on each lot?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",23
"24","—I could not exactly say, and I will tell you the reason of that. The hill pasture, which was for the",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",24
"25","summering of the sheep, is on the side of the man who has the three lots. ",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",25
"26","7635. About how many sheep are there to any lot? Eight or nine, or how many?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",26
"27","—I don't think that each has more than six.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",27
"28","7636. How many have you got yourself?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",28
"29","—Eight, and another man may have only four.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",29
"30","7637. No horse?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",30
"31","—No horse.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",31
"32","7638. What is the rent of a lot for two cows, the follower, and seven sheep?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",32

"35","—The one with the three lots pays three times as much rent as the single lots do.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",35
"36","7640. Has he three times as much stock?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",36
"37","—I cannot be sure.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",37
"38","7641. About how much arable ground has each lot?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",38
"39","—I cannot say what the acreage would be. I can tell how much crop I put in of potatoes and oats. The way the ground is, —in spots here and there—it could not very well be measured.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",39
"40","7642. How long ago is it since it was divided into seven lots?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",40
"41","—More than three years ago. It was in Mr Mackay's time, the former proprietor, and k was Mr Mackay who raised the rents in the island.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",41
"42","7643. Was the rent fixed at £5 in Mr Mackay's time?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",42
"43","—Yes; it was Mr Mackay who raised it to £5.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",43
"44","7644. Has it been raised since?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",44
"45","—No.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",45
"46","7645. Has anybody been evicted since you recollect?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",46
"47","—No, I don't recollect a case of eviction in our township.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",47
"48","7646. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",48

"50","—All our forefathers have been on this island from time immemorial.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",50
"51","7647. In regard to the depopulation of the island in former times, was not Raasay at one time full of people?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",51
"52","—Yes.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",52
"53","7648. When did the people first begin to be put out of the island?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",53
"54","—It is forty years since the first removings.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",54
"55","7649. Who was the proprietor then?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",55
"56","—M'Leod of Raasay.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",56
"57","7650. How many people, roughly speaking, were removed at that time?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",57

"60","—Yes.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",60
"61","7652. More than one?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",61
"62","—Not at the first removing. These all went to America.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",62
"63","7653. A ship-load at least went to America the first time?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",63
"64","—To the best of my recollection.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",64
"65","7654. How long ago is it since the second?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",65
"66","—Thirty years ago.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",66
"67","7655. When did your present proprietor come?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",67
"68","—About six years ago.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",68
"69","7656. Have you, or the people of your township, made any complaint to him or remonstrance against the amount of the rent you are complaining of to-day?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",69
"70","—Yes.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",70
"71","7657. What answer did you get?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",71
"72","—When the township was settled a family came from Eilean Tighe, and there was no place open for that man, and he was settled in our place for a year.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",72
"73","7658. But have you made any remonstrance to Mr Wood, the present proprietor, against the amount of your rent?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",73
"74","—Yes. This man from island Tighe was settled for a year in our midst, as there was no other place for",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",74
"75","him, and £5 additional was laid upon us, and we were wanting Mr Wood to take off this additional £5. Mr Wood promised to do this, and when the fence was put up between us and the man who has got the three lots, the £5 was left as a set-off against the interest of the fence.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",75
"76","7659. You complain you have not enough land to work?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",76
"77","—Yes.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",77
"78","7660. Where could you or your co-crofters get land?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",78
"79","—On the property of the island.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",79
"80","7661. Where?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",80

"87","—Yes.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",87
"88","7665. Has he all that Mackenzie had?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",88
"89","—Yes.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",89
"90","7666. And more?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",90
"91","—I am not aware he has more.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",91
"92","7667. Is there land in the proprietors' hands convenient for them without necessitating the removal of some of them from their houses?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",92
"93","—There is the hill pasture, which we might get plenty of. There is no arable land near us, which could be added to our lots where we are, but there is plenty of hill pasture. ",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",93
"94","7668. Would yon be satisfied if you got more hill pasture?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",94
"95","—We would try to put up with it. Our lots are spoiled with game, pheasants, and rabbits, so much so that it is not worth our while sowing our ground at all.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",95
"96","7669. Have you remonstrated against that to Mr Wood?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",96
"97","—Yes.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",97
"98","7670. What relief has he given you?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",98

"100","7671. Have you liberty to kill rabbits or to trap them?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",100

"103","—How many barrels of oats do you sow on your arable ground?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",103
"104","—Three and a half barrels of seed oats.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",104
"105","7673. And how much potatoes?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",105
"106","—Between four and five barrels of splits. We are putting down as much seed as would serve our families if the ground were at all good.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",106
"107","7674. Do the people get much work from the proprietor?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",107
"108","—Yes, those who can work got work. So far as I am concerned I have to attend to the tillage of my lot with my only son. The ground will not yield oats after potatoes unless it is freshly manured.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",108
"109","7675. But the people, as a rule, get plenty work?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",109
"110","—Yes.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",110
"111","7676. Do they get more work than they did in the time of the former proprietors?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",111
"112","—They were getting work in the time of the former proprietors, but matters are heavier upon us now than then.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",112
"113","7677. In what way are they heavier?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",113
"114","—It is worse with us, the more we have to work our lands without getting a return; and in former days, we were not losing our crops with game as we are at present.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",114
"115","7678. Would you rather go back to the times of the former proprietor, without the game, or be under Mr Wood, and get the work, with the rabbits?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",115
"116","—Mr Wood is a kind landlord to us,—in fact, kinder than any man we have seen here—and he is showing kindness to us in many ways ; more than we have experienced from his predecessors. He is sending us a doctor.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",116
"117","7679. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",117
"118","—There are five people in your township. Did they all gather to send you here, or was the man who had three shares not one of them?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",118
"119","—Yes.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",119
"120","7680. Were they all five gathered to send you here?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",120
"121","—Only the four sent me here. The man with the three lots was at first delegated to come and speak for the township.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",121
"122","7681. Why did they change their first arrangement?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",122
"123","—It was changed outside to shorten the list of delegates.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",123
"124","7682. They appointed two to begin with?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",124
"125","—Yes.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",125
"126","7683. You mentioned something about a deer fence. Is there a deer fence cutting you off from the proprietor's lands?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",126
"127","—Yes.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",127
"128","7684. Is that a matter of complaint that that fence should be there?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",128
"129","—It is a cause of complaint, for our cattle cannot get to our own pasturage, owing to the roughness of the ground leading to it, and the fence is in the way. They are shut in in their own hill pasture by this fence.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",129
"130","7685. Have they their own hill pasture behind this fence?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",130
"131","—No.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",131
"132","7686. You would like to cross part of the proprietor's land to get to a remote part of your own pasture?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",132
"133","—The fence was fixed so close to rocky ground that our cows cannot get between these rocks and their own ground to their pasturage.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",133
"134","7687. The Chairman.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",134
"135","—If the line of fence was altered, would that satisfy you?",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",135
"136","—That is what we were wishing to be done —to have it put back for a few yards. We were wanting this when the fence was being put up. There is no port for hauling up our boats on our ground.",144,"Charles Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",136
