"100","—Yes; the ground we occupy is hardly worth any rent.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",100

"121","30335. Do you think you have to pay in money 31s. for each cow in the year ?",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",121
"122","—Some of them have; it depends on how they work their land. Some keep more land in grass, and others cultivate more produce.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",122
"123","30336. Do you ever pay as much as 31s. in the year for your cow ?",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",123

"125","30337. Do you know other people who have to pay 31s. in the year ?",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",125
"126","—There is a man here from the township who can tell that.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",126
"127","30338. Is that for the cow that really belongs to the place and to the summing, or is it for an extra cow beyond your proper stock ?",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",127
"128","—Sometimes we rear a young beast in order to replace an old cow, and in that case the expense is incurred.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",128
"129","30339. Do you always find it easy to buy additional fodder for the winter ?",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",129
"130","—Some years we do, and others not.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",130

"137","—Yes.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",137
"138","30343. Can you tell me what stock you are allowed to keep?",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",138
"139","—A cow, a stirk, and a few sheep, because the place is too rocky for cattle.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",139

"153","—We agree satisfactorily in regard to that amongst ourselves.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",153
"154","30351. Do those who have sheep pay anything to those who have none ?",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",154
"155","—No, because an understanding was arrived at amongst ourselves, and those who don't have them cannot claim anything from those that have.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",155
"156","30352. I thought there were no sheep in the summing?",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",156
"157","—No.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",157
"158","30353. And don't the sheep spoil the pasture of those that have no sheep at all ?",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",158
"159","—We keep them up to the rock at the back.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",159
"160","30354. Those that have no sheep have no cause to complain against those that have ?",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",160
"161","—There are not so many sheep as to make any difference.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",161
"162","30355. You don't consider that the place is too highly rented ?",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",162
"163","—There is no doubt but it is.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",163
"164","30356. How would you like to get your rent fixed if you got additional ground ?",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",164
"165","—If we got it from the proprietor himself, we would be quite satisfied to get it reasonable. ",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",165

"167","—Quite so.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",167

"169","—Very much, better than where we are.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",169

"171","—Some of it.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",171
"172","30360. You would prefer to be there rather than where you are 1",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",172
"173","—Undoubtedly.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",173
"174","30361. Those of you who have double crofts, 1 suppose, are much better off than those who have only one ?",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",174
"175","—I don't think so, considering the nature of the place and the circumstances we are situated in.",513,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Balmacara",175
