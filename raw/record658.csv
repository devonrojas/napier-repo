"2","39634. The Chairman.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",2
"3","—Did you get your croft after the expiration of your military service or did it belong to your family before?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",3
"4","—It belonged to my father. My father was an old soldier.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",4
"5","39635. Then you have been two generations of soldiers and crofters?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",5
"6","—Yes.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",6
"7","39636. Have you a statement to make?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",7
"8","—Yes. 'Grievance of the Torboll Tenants.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",8
"9","—Previous to the year 1826 Torboll contained only four tenants, but on the expulsion of the people from the neighbouring lands to make room for a sheep farm, the four lots were subdivided into seven. On a complaint being made to Lady Stafford of the smallness of the crofts, she granted them the use of the grass growing on a piece of land reolaimed from the sea, called "" The Ebb,"" to winter a cow and a horse for each tenant This continued until the year 1881. After they had got the hay seasoned, and carried part of it on their backs for half a mile through the wood, possession was taken of it by the Duke's forester. On a complaint being made by Sergeant Mackintosh to the factor, he promised to lay the matter before the Duke, and to let them know his decision in a few days; but no word was received until late in October. The day after the Duke left for London the innkeeper at Dornoch, to whom the hay was said to be sold by the forester, sent carts and took it away. The people then had to sell part of their beasts at a loss, having lost the chance of the market owing to its being so late in the season, not having received word sooner. We complain of the smallness of our holdings, not being large enough to maintain us six months in the year, insecurity of tenure, no protection against rack-renting, and no compensation for improvements in case of removal.'",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",9
"10","39637. Is this additional piece of land, called The Ebb, still in possession of the crofters?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",10
"11","—No.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",11
"12","39638. I don't quite understand what has become of this piece of land. Is it now taken away entirely from the township?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",12
"13","—It is taken away from the tenants, and they will not get leave to cut grass.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",13
"14","39639. They are not allowed to cut grass upon it?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",14

"16","39640. But they are allowed to pasture it?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",16
"17","—No, they are not allowed. It is fenced in. It belongs to the Duke, and is fenced in; but they got liberty for forty or fifty years to take grass to help them.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",17
"18","39641. And they have no longer that liberty now?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",18
"19","—No, not for two years back.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",19

"30","39647. What stock do they usually keep —those who have three or four acres?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",30
"31","—They keep, perhaps, two or three cows; and I keep one myself—no horse.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",31
"32","39648. Do they never keep horses?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",32
"33","—Yes, some of them have horses, but they provide for the horses by gathering whins for them, and one thing and another.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",33
"34","39649. But the lot does not keep the horse?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",34
"35","—No.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",35

"39","—Yes, they may have a young beast or the like of that, but they cannot keep them long.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",39
"40","39652. Do they keep them two years or one year?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",40

"50","39657. Do the people fish?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",50

"55","—Not that I know of, except working about farms and the like of that.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",55
"56","39660. How do the people generally live then; do they go away to other parts of Scotland for work?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",56
"57","—The young men do so, and some of the young women, and they help their parents too. That is the general style they have; and if it were not for that I believe we would have the old people all on the poor roll.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",57
"58","39661. You say there is no compensation for improvements in case of removal; have you any cases of removal? Do you know of any cases?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",58

"62","39663. What about the houses? Have the houses been improved in your recollection?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",62
"63","—Yes. I have improved my own. house. It cost me £40. I got rope and sarking from the Duke to the value of about £7; but it cost me £40 to improve it myself, and if I left it next day I would not get any value for it",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",63
"64","39664. Were you born there?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",64
"65","—I was born in the parish of Rogart.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",65
"66","39665. How long did your father have this same croft; had he the same croft that you have?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",66
"67","—Yes, he had, but it was larger. It was subdivided. When I went to the army there were only four tenants.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",67
"68","39666. When did you go to the army ?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",68

"70","39667. How many years were you away without seeing your country?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",70

"74","—Well, there was not much improvement?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",74
"75","—Well, yes, in regard to different things, the people are getting tidier and cleaner than they were in old times. There is something in that. ",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",75
"76","39669. But since you came back has there been more improvement than there was before, or less?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",76
"77","—Well, I don't think there is.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",77
"78","39670. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",78
"79","—What do you mean by rack-renting? ",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",79
"80","—Well, we don't pay a rack-rent. We don't grumble about our rents. They are not very high. I have about two and a-half acres of arable land. I took in one and a half acres myself since I came to the place, and kept it for a few years, but then it gave me no return. It would hardly give me the value of the seed, and it was destroyed by black game and rabbits. I only keep about two and a half acres, or two and a quarter acres.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",80
"81","39671. I suppose this paper expresses the wish of the tenants around you?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",81
"82","—Yes.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",82
"83","39672. They ask for protection from rack-renting; what do they mean? Are the others too high rented?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",83
"84","—No, I don't think they are too high rented; but I don't know. But still they might raise it. That is what it means.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",84
"85","39673. They are afraid it might be raised?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",85
"86","—Yes.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",86
"87","39674. Mr Cameron.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",87
"88","—Why do they say that the 1st October was too late to sell their stirks?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",88
"89","—The prices were not so good.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",89
"90","39675. It was not that the date itself was too late?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",90
"91","—I had two cows myself, and I had to sell one of them; I would get the double of the price next year for it.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",91
"92","39676. The prices fell, but it was not that the date itself was too late?",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",92
"93","—Yes.",658,"Hugh Mackintosh","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",93
