"2","5329. The Chairman.",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",2
"3","—How long have you been a minister at Sleat? ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",3
"4","—Eight and a half years. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",4
"5","5330. You have heard the description which has been given by several persons here with reference to the general condition—physical condition—of the people at the present time, contrasted with its former condition. Do you agree with their statements generally ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",5
"6","—Generally speaking. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",6
"7","5331. You think there is really a deterioration in the condition of the people of late years ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",7
"8","—Well I think about this time is the poorest time, owing to the general destitution over the island. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",8
"9","5332. Do you think there is any hardship connected with the supplies of the people being almost exclusively procured from one shop ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",9
"10","—Well, I have thought over that subject. I do not know that there is any, comparing it with any of the other parishes. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",10
"11","5333. You don't think there is any hardship ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",11
"12","—That is to say, things are not dearer here than in other parishes. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",12
"13","5334. You don't think they are dearer ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",13
"14","—I would not say they are. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",14
"15","5335. Supposing there were two or three opposition shops established, do you think that the custom of the place would give a sufficient support to other shops ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",15
"16","—Well, I think it would give support to two or three at least. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",16
"17","5336. Some reference has been made here to-day to an alleged notice or placard which was set up in connection with the custom of the people at this particular shop. Have you any personal knowledge of such a thing having been done ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",17
"18","—I would rather not state it; but if I am compelled to state, I will tell the truth. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",18
"19","5337. I think it would be desirable, in order to prevent any misapprehension on this subject, that a full statement should be made ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",19
"20","—I have seen the placard with my eyes. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",20
"21","5338. Will you kindly state what the nature of the notice really was?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",21
"22","—To the best of my memory it was this, that no shopkeeper—that is petty shopkeeper—would be allowed to sell things without an additional £2 of rent. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",22
"23","5339. That no new shop would be allowed?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",23
"24","—Yes, in Sleat or Broadford. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",24
"25","5340. And that an additional rent would be imposed upon those who bought at such a shop ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",25
"26","—No, but upon the shops. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",26
"27","5341. That the additional rent would be imposed upon any person who established a shop ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",27
"28","—It amounted to that. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",28
"29","5342. Did that cause any discontent among the people at the time ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",29
"30","—Well, it was just said, I think, among the people at the time",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",30
"31","—What are we coming to ?' ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",31
"32","5343. How long was the notice left at the place where it was fixed up ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",32
"33","—I cannot say how long it was, but I have seen it at the inn of Isle Ornsay, and the innkeeper is here. It was fixed on the door of the inn. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",33
"34","5344. Did it profess to be issued by any authority, or was it an unsigned, unsanctioned notice ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",34
"35","—To the best of my recollection, it was written ' Estate Office.' ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",35
"36","5345. Was there any signature attached to it?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",36
"37","—No signature. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",37
"38","5346. How long ago was it ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",38
"39","—I should say about five years ago.  ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",39
"40","5347. How was it removed?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",40
"41","—I cannot say. I was just passing, and noticed the statement, and wondered at it. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",41
"42","5348. Did it gradually disappear, or was it removed by violence ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",42
"43","— I cannot say. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",43
"44","5349. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",44
"45","—Are you aware that it attracted some attention, and was taken notice of in the newspapers?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",45
"46","—There was a rumour to that effect. I did not see it in the newspapers. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",46
"47","5350. But it disappeared very quickly. At least you did not see it but the once?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",47
"48","—I did not see it but the once. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",48
"49","5351. Have you heard that it was intended to circulate copies of this notice, and that it was actually in print, but was withdrawn in consequence of the notice that appeared in the newspapers ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",49
"50","—It is possible, but I cannot vouch for it. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",50
"51","5352. In regard to the school board elections, have you some knowledge of the elections of the school board?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",51
"52","—I have some knowledge of that. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",52
"53","5353. Has there or has there not, in your opinion, in past times, been influence used in the election of the members of the school boards ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",53
"54","— Well, at the time I thought so, but as it was an old story I was willing to forget and forgive. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",54
"55","5354. But you think there was influence used ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",55
"56","—At the time I did. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",56
"57","5355. Do you know anything about the story we have heard as to the selection of animals by the factor or ground officer?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",57
"58","—I do not know exactly what that means. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",58
"59","5356. That once a year the people of Sleat got a message on a certain day to gather all their beasts together, and the factor or ground officer went and made an inspection, and bought the animals at his own price, or something to that effect ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",59
"60","—There was a rumour to that effect. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",60
"61","5357. What is the name of the doctor of the parish ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",61
"62","—Dr Graham. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",62
"63","5358. Is he here ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",63
"64","—Yes. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",64
"65","5359. Do you know anything about sea-ware in this parish of Sleat ? Are you aware that, though the tenants have been in many cases refused sea-ware, eight vessels came here, and were allowed to carry away ballast in the shape of stones, which are useful to keep the sea-ware together ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",65
"66","— I have never heard it as a grievance  ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",66
"67","5360. Do you know a man named Alexander Macdonald, Saasaig ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",67
"68","—I know the person. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",68
"69","5361. Are you aware he alleges he has a very serious grievance?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",69
"70","—I have not heard it. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",70
"71","5362. Mr Cameron.",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",71
"72","—What is the population of Isle Ornsay ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",72
"73","—There are only a few houses in Isle Ornsay. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",73
"74","5363. But in the parish ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",74
"75","—About 2000. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",75
"76","5364. Do you think, if there were two shops established at Isle Ornsay, there would be any reasonable amount of profit to the shopkeepers ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",76
"77","—I don't know about that. I speak of the parish. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",77
"78","5365. You think there might be another shop established at the other end of the parish ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",78
"79","—I should think so. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",79
"80","5366. Are you aware that shops, as a rule, pay a higher rent than ordinary houses where no business is conducted ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",80
"81","—That is very true. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",81
"82","5367. Do you think £2 extra, for a man who keeps a shop as distinguished from an ordinary house, is a very high rent, or a very great grievance ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",82
"83","—I don't know how to answer that question. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",83
"84","5368. This notice you talk of stated that if anybody kept a shop besides the shop which existed, £2 would be laid upon the persons so keeping the shop. Don't you consider £2 a very moderate increase of rent for a person who keeps a shop, beyond one who lives in an ordinary dwelling house ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",84
"85","—Yes, I would think that was a moderate rent, if that was the only object. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",85
"86","5369. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",86
"87","—As a matter of fact, are there any other petty shops in the parish ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",87
"88","—There are a number of petty shops. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",88
"89","5370. Do these pay £2 extra?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",89
"90","—I don't think so. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",90
"91","5371. Professor Mackinnon.",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",91
"92","—The local influence you talk of with respect to the school board election was not more keen than the usual influence that is exercised in parliamentary elections ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",92
"93","—Well, I thought so ; but I did not expect to be examined on this point. I thought it was keen enough at the time. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",93
"94","5372. But keener than when there is a contest for the county?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",94
"95","—I think so. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",95
"96","5373. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",96
"97","—What was the reason given commonly among the people for setting up this placard ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",97
"98","—That was a well understood reason—that they would purchase at Isle Ornsay. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",98
"99","5374. That was the common reason alleged ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",99
"100","—That was well understood. I do not know that there was any secret about it, that Tormore was a partner in the business. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",100
"101","5375. It was held to be the general opinion of the place that that was the reason for setting up the notice ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",101
"102","—Yes. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",102
"103","5376. The document which has been given in by the different townships seems to have been prepared at the sight of yourself and the minister of the parish, and you were both present ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",103
"104","—Yes. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",104
"105","5377. I suppose you both agree generally, so far as your observation is concerned, not only in the truth of the statements there, but also that they are correctly stated by the people ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",105
"106","—I do not know whether the Rev. Mr Cameron concurs in the statements, but we thought we had a duty to perform in preparing the people for the Royal Commission, and we performed it together. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",106
"107","5378. Have you anything further to say ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",107
"108","—There is a grievance, and I make it a grievance of my own, because the parties of whom I speak have not the proper attention I thought they were entitled to, and these are the paupers. Our inspector of poor is at Portree. He was at Isle Ornsay, and when he went to Portree he carried the office of inspector with him to Portree, and his assistant-inspector is ground officer and sheriff officer, and school board officer and several other offices, I think. Now, in my judgment, I think he is not a proper man —the man I would like to see in charge of the paupers, if there were a responsible person in Sleat. I would not complain, but I don't think he has the full powers he ought to have in dealing with cases. He has often to consult round at Portree as to what he is to do in cases of that kind, and it is a hard thing sometimes, and I could give instances of hardships I have seen to paupers suffering. I know that even at this day, although our factor ordered the houses of some paupers to be repaired, it is not done yet. It has not been done for a year. I think the arrangements are entirely unsuitable for the parish. I would not deprive an old man of eighty of his office, if there was a responsible man in the parish to have charge of the parish. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",108
"109","5379. The Chairman.",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",109
"110","—Who is the inspector at Portree?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",110
"111","—Mr Mackenzie. He is road inspector, and holds several other offices. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",111
"112","5380. Who are the members of the school board in this parish ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",112
"113","—Lord Macdonald; Mr Macdonald, Ord; Mr Macdonald, Tormore; Mr Cameron, and myself. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",113
"114","5381. Do you think it would be agreeable to the people connected with the crofting community to have a representative on the board of their own class ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",114
"115","—I don't think they thought they would have that privilege. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",115
"116","5382. But have you ever had occasion to know that they desire it, or that it would be acceptable to them ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",116
"117","—I have not. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",117
"118","5383. You don't think it ever occurred to them to aspire to a seat upon the school board ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",118
"119","—I don't think so.",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",119
"120","5384. They probably look on you as their particular representative ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",120
"121","— I think so, at least the ministers. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",121
"122","5385. Sheriff Nicolson.",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",122
"123","—Were any of the little shops closed in consequence of that formidable placard ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",123
"124","—No, but they were alarmed. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",124
"125","5386. The Chairman.",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",125
"126","—I thought the placard meant that any other shops, any new shops which should be opened, should pay £2 additional rent. I did not understand it to mean that the petty shops existing should pay additional rent ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",126
"127","—I did not take that meaning out of it; I thought that the existing shops should pay £ 2 additional. ",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",127
"128","5387. Without any additional accommodation in the way of building or convenience to be afforded them ?",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",128
"129","—Quite so.",101,"Finlay Graham","Skye, Isle Ornsay",129
