"1","MICHAEL BUCHANAN, Crofter and Fisherman, Borv (40)—examined. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",1
"2","10178. The Chairman.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",2
"3","Have you a croft ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",3
"4","—My brother is a crofter. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",4
"5","10179. Do you help him to pay the rent?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",5
"6","—Yes; I have laboured for the last twenty-eight years to pay the rent with him. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",6
"7","10180. Were you freely elected a delegate by the people of Borv?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",7
"8","— Freely and unanimously. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",8
"9","10181. What number of persons were present when you were elected?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",9
"10","— There were six or seven from the township of Borv, having the consent of all the rest. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",10
"11","10182. Would you be so good as to make a statement of what their wishes are ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",11
"12","—Yes. I only wish to have first the opportunity of saying a few words. I should like to get an assurance that my interest, and that of my brother, whose name is written in the rental, should not be hurt by any procedure taken by the landlord or factor—I mean in the way of eviction—for any truthful statement I may make here to day before the Royal Commission. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",12
"13","10183. Is there any person here representing the proprietor?Mr Ranald Macdonald, factor for Lady Gordon Cathcart.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",13
"14","—I have to state that any one and every one here may speak fully and freely without any fear of any kind whatever. Witness.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",14
"15","—The people are complaining of the smallness of their holding and its inferior quality, of the uphanded-ness of the factors, and the oppression of landlords. Before the year 1827 the island of Barra was almost always occupied by crofters, who lived comfortably and contentedly iu possession of reasonably large crofts, the population being then about 3000, and at present it is only 2000. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",15
"16","10184. Mr Fraser Mackintosh.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",16
"17","—Are you referring at present to the whole estate of Barra?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",17
"18","—The whole estate of Barra. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",18
"19","10185.And all its islands ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",19
"20","—All its islands. Unscrupulous factors and ground officers and estate officials laid their hand pretty heavily upon the people, and left them in such a state that they could scarcely ask land and pay for it, their whole stock being taken away ; and some of the inhabitants, even up to the present day never saw a cow in their fold or a horse to be harnessed at their door. This has been the severest blow that ever the inhabitants of this island suffered. The next attack was that stirks and two-year-olds were taken away from them by ground officers and other estate officials, and sold to their own friends by private bargain at the respective prices of from 2s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",20
"21","10186. The Chairman.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",21
"22","You say that the first wrong was about 1827. When was this practice of taking the stirks introduced ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",22
"23","—The first took place forty-years ago, and the second took place thirty-seven years ago. Down from these dates incoming factors and incoming ground officers were participating in the same action. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",23
"24","10187. Down to the present time?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",24
"25","—Down to the present time. People in those days, particularly in such an outlandish place as this is, did not ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",25
"26","understand very much the use of receipts. They used to pay their rents, and when the receipt was handed over perhaps some of them carried it home, and perhaps some of them did not. However, those who did carry it home perhaps lost it or mislaid it. The next time they made their appearance before the factor to pay their rent they were told—' You did not pay your rent last year.' ' I did.' 'You did not; where is your  receipt ?' I have seen some of them going home a matter of six or seven miles, and coming back breathless with the receipt. Some would happen to find it at home, and some would not. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",26
"27","10188. How long ago was this about the receipts ? Does that continue till the present time ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",27
"28","—No. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",28
"29","10189. How long ago is it?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",29
"30","—About twenty-two years ago. The large farmers in this island, in the event of an incoming factor, would of course get first in contact with him; and I understand that we, the poor people, would get a very bad character, and we would be most likely, during that man's time, under the suspicion that we were bad characters. Any grievances that we stated to the factor he would postpone or resist. He would say, ' I will see you to-morrow,' and then when I saw him to-morrow he would say, ' Oh, I can't do anything for you.' On the other hand, if any of those large farmers were to express any grievance, they would be sure that the factor would listen to them. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",30
"31","10190. As regards this partiality to the farmers and against the crofters, was that in former times, or is it still kept up?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",31
"32","—It was in former times, and is still kept up in a less degree. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",32
"33","10191. Have you any further statement?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",33
"34","—That their cattle were forcibly taken away from them, and in many cases after selling those cattle some ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",34
"35","of the men did not get any credit for the proceeds. I refer to the cattle taken away in those days. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",35
"36","10192. You mean the cattle that were purchased by the factors or ground agents ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",36
"37","—They were taken away by the ground agents and factors. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",37
"38","10193. And no payment made?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",38
"39","—For a nominal price, and in the name of rent, and in many cases afterwards the people never got credit for the money proceeds. The inhabitants of the island being reduced to such poverty, the consequence was that they were not able to pay rent, and could scarcely ask for land. Consequently the best and the most of the land fell into the hands of large farmers, and the poor men were huddled together, the one lessening the holding of the other; and that was on the most worthless and useless patches of land that could be found within the marches of the parish of Barra. Labouring under such disadvantages, they were obliged to apply to Dr M'Gillivray for some ground, for which they paid sixty days' labour per acre of sandy, inferior, and exhausted soil. About six years ago there were letters down from the English market, desiring the natives of this island to gather every kind of shell-fish, particularly cockles, which were and are very abundant, and to be found on the strand lying adjacent to Dr M'Gillivray's farm. Dr M'Gillivray tried to prevent any collection of this shell-fish. The people did not pay much attention to what he said. Then his brother-in-law, being at the time the head ground officer on the estate—or, at least, he was called so—drew up a paper with orders that it should be posted up on the chapel door, threatening the gatherers of this shell-fish with certain penalties. The officiating clergyman of that chapel did not give his assent to this proceeding, and told his congregation that he considered it an illegal act. Being thus baffled, those two gentlemen, as justices of the peace, ordered policemen to watch for fear that any of the shell-fish should be laid down above high water-mark. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",39
"40","10194. Was Dr M'Gillivray a tacksman or a proprietor?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",40
"41","—A tacksman. He is the largest farmer on this estate. His brother-in-law, to whom I have referred, Roderick M'Lellan, then commenced to prevent the thoroughfare down to the shipping place, and even prevented the use of the steamer's boat to carry the cargo on board. Seemingly they were willing to deprive the poor inhabitants of the produce of the sea, as they were instrumental in depriving them of the produce of their native soil. They coveted, and succeeded in their attempts, and put us back to the precarious occupation of fishing, which limited our livelihood to an inferior condition. Another prevalent grievance is, that should I or any other man, particularly any other tenant who pays his rent honestly, say a word on behalf of another man, mostly all the officials on the estate are down upon him, and consequently he is afraid to say much. The inhabitants of this island have every confidence in their present proprietrix, Lady Gordon Cathcart, that she would promote their interest and comfort were their cases properly laid before her ladyship, but the factor steps in and offers every possible opposition. As to the fishing resources of this island, I must suggest that the people cannot derive their livelihood out of the sea, for the following reasons :",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",41
"42","—For the stormy seas by which this island is surrounded, for the irregularity of the ground and banks by which it is surrounded, because the nourishing ingredients natural where fish live are not to be found about this island, and because they can only fish opposite here at certain seasons of the year, and if the weather does not permit at these certain seasons of the year the fisherman loses the privilege. I admit that the fishing industry is a great help combined with that of land. The reason is that when I don't get to sea, if I have less or more land I have still something to support me; but supposing I have no land, if I am going to sea and getting no fish, I have nothing at all whereby my family can live. The second reason is the insular situation of this island, and its irregular postal communication, from which we learn the state of the markets. Though local merchants here would buy fish, they must always be very cautions; they must always depend upon the contingency of future markets. In regard to a fisherman's land, I should say he should have about seven acres to keep a cow and a horse, with potato ground. To keep a cow is very necessary, because milk is a very nourishing article in a family where young children are brought up. It is peats that we generally use on this island as fuel. The peats are now so much run out and consumed, except in inaccessible patches of moss land, that fishermen would require the use of a pony to carry home their peats. The farmer do not go about here as they do on the east coast with a cart selling peats ; neither does the dairyman go about selling a pennyworth of milk; the coal merchant does not go about here selling half a cwt. of coal. Therefore unless the fisherman has land here, he cannot obtain any of those above described articles. I should also say that the fish-curers who visit this island ought to receive every encouragement from Government, as they are the only means of giving work to the inhabitants of the island, particularly when successful—men, women, and children. The encouragement I mean is the extension of the wire from Loch Boisdale to Castle Bay, whereby they would learn the state of the English, Scotch, and continental markets, and the fishing of the different Hebridean stations. The scarcity of land necessarily produces scarcity of fodder and provender—I mean hay and straw. When any part of their grazing gets bare, the beast that grazes there naturally goes away to graze where the gras3 is allowed ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",42
"43","to grow. When our patches are getting bare, our horses and cattle are very apt to go over the march of the big farmer—that march which is neither stone-dyke nor fence—and the consequence is that the beast is taken by the farmer's servant by order of the farmer and put into a pound. That pound is not fit for an animal; the beast is up to the belly in mud and water. The farmer is not very apt to give an intimation when he pounds that beast. Sometimes there is a lapse of twenty-four hours, and the consequences are great losses and deaths of animals. It also subjects the horses of this island to a local disease called trance—I mean by that, that all the natural functions of the beast are suspended. It shakes and gets short of breath, and loses all self-command, and dies in a little while—of which I have seen instances. Again, arising from the same cause, we are obliged to live in thatched houses, and we are obliged to make application to Dr M'Gillivray for bent grass to thatch our houses. We have to labour twelve clays for two small cart-loads of that bent, and in many instances the application is refused. We thought of late, and we had great hopes,that our holdings would be enlarged on account of Lady Gordon Cathcart and her factor receiving back the lease from Mr M'Lellan, Vatersay, but it happened unfortunately that we did not get the chance. That is all my voluntary statement. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",43
"44","10195. You have mentioned two abuses which prevailed in former times —one of them, according to your account, in your own recollection. The first abuse to which I allude is that of the compulsory- purchase of cattle, and the price being withheld, or not being credited in the rent account, and you stated that the practice of purchasing cattle arose about thirty-seven years ago, and continued on till a later period. Can you give me any example, with date and name, of the price being withheld from a crofter?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",44
"45","—Yes. There was an old widow woman in a township of this parish, called Earsary. The ground officer and other estate officials came and took away a fine heifer about three years old, I believe, for the matter of 30s. or so, in the name of rent. They did not proceed very far when they met with a native of this island who they thought had money, and they asked him if he would buy that heifer. He said he did not know. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",45
"46","They said they would give him a bargain of it. He said he did not know if he had enough money to buy the beast. ' Oh, you need not be afraid; we will give you a bargain.' Then when he thought he would get a ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",46
"47","bargain he bought the beast. They then invited him back to a shebeen, and drank the proceeds; and the man is within the walls of this building at this very moment. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",47
"48","10196. How much did the man give for the heifer to the ground officer ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",48
"49","—That is more than I can state, but we can get the information from the man who is within the house. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",49
"50","10197. Can you state that whatever was given for it was not carried to the widow's account ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",50
"51","—Yes; she did not get credit for the proceeds. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",51
"52","10198. Can you cite any other examples of that nature ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",52
"53","—Yes. There was a man named Donald Mackinnon living in the township of Tangasdale, Michael ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",53
"54","and the ground officer I refer to was John M'Gregor. Buchanan. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",54
"55","10199. Mr Cameron.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",55
"56","The same ground officer as in the other case?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",56
"57","— Yes, the same ground officer. He came to this man's house, and asked him for a stirk. Well, the man could scarcely refuse him, for he knew the consequences too well if he did refuse him—there was a staff of legal officers along with him—and he gave the stirk. They then went to some house in the neighbourhood and drank whisky there for a good long time, and then they asked the man would he buy the stirk for 7s. He said he had not 7s. ' Oh, yes; you must have 7s.; we know you have 7s.' ' No,' says the man; but the man's wife being within reach of hearing— she used to weave with one of those handlooms—had 7s., and she went and bought the animal for 7s., and the 7s. was paid there and then. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",57
"58","10200. The Chairman.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",58
"59","Was the value of the animal not carried to the man's credit?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",59
"60","—The value of the animal was not carried to the man's credit, and the man is present here. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",60
"61","10201. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",61
"62","Do you mean that the wife bought back the animal for 7s?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",62
"63","—Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",63
"64","10202. Professor Mackinnon.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",64
"65","Was it Mackinnon's own wife who bought the animal back ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",65
"66","—Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",66
"67","10203. The Chairman.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",67
"68","With reference to the other abuse you mentioned about the receipts, you stated that when receipts were not preserved a second payment of rent was exacted. Can you give us any example of that ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",68
"69","—Yes; I was present one day in North Bay inn about sixteen years ago, and I saw a man belonging to Bravaig going in. His name was Murdoch Mackinnon. Mr Birnie told him he had not paid his rent last year, and the man said he had. Mr Birnie said he had not. He was rather a hasty man in temper, and the man was very certain he had paid his rent, and he was a little bolder. He was obliged to leave the house. He went away in my presence and came back panting, having by good luck fallen in with the receipt. Mr Birnie took the receipt, and pulled a shilling out of his pocket, and said, ' Here, you can drink this shilling.' The man is here. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",69
"70","10204. But he brought the receipt?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",70
"71","—Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",71
"72","10205. And he was not obliged to pay?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",72
"73","—No, otherwise he would have been obliged to pay. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",73
"74","10206. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",74
"75","What did Mr Birnie give him the shilling for—for his trouble?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",75
"76","—Yes, for his trouble in going there. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",76
"77","10207. The Chairman.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",77
"78","Have either of these two abuses—either the compulsory sale of cattle or the exaction of rent a second time—existed in recent years—say within the last ten years ? Does the practice of compulsory purchase of cattle exist at all ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",78
"79","—It does not. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",79
"80","10208. How long is it since it ceased?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",80
"81","—I believe about twelve years ago. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",81
"82","10209. Then there is perfect freedom in the sale of cattle at present ? ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",82
"83","—Perfect freedom, so far as I know. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",83
"84","10210. Is there any trouble about the receipts?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",84
"85","—Well, last year—I am not exactly sure whether it was last year or the year before—I saw a little. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",85
"86","I saw a man who was obliged to go back to the township of Kentangaval, because Mr Barron, the new factor, told him he had not paid last year's rent. He was a young lad, who represented his mother. He had to go back for the receipt. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",86
"87","10211. Still it is right that people should keep their receipts, and produce them when called for. Do you mean to say that the factor's books are not regularly kept and entered up ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",87
"88","—I don't mean to say that; I only 1 mean to say I have seen it done. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",88
"89","10212. What about the gathering of cockles, which I understand is an old practice in the island ? Is there any difficulty or impediment at present ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",89
"90","—They are not gathered at all at present. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",90
"91","10213. Are they still to be found in the same quantities?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",91
"92","—Still to befound in the same quantities. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",92
"93","10214. Are they not gathered anywhere?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",93
"94","—Not gathered anywhere within the boundaries of this parish that I am aware of. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",94
"95","10215. What is the reason of that?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",95
"96","—Want of demand in the English market. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",96
"97","10216. But do the people not gather them at all for their own food ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",97
"98","—In former years it was the case, but now the people are generally employed elsewhere. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",98
"99","10217. Then they don't use cockles for making broth or for food in any form ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",99
"100","—I never saw them used for food for the last twelve or thirteen years. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",100
"101","10218. But if the people wished to gather them would the tacksman or proprietor now impose any difficulty ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",101
"102","—The proprietor never imposed any difficulty; on the contrary, Mr Birnie, when factor, was very much against doing so. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",102
"103","10219. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",103
"104","Very much against imposing difficulties or against gathering cockles ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",104
"105","—Against prohibiting them. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",105
"106","10220. The Chairman",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",106
"107","He was in favour of allowing the people to do it?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",107
"108","—Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",108
"109","10221. Is Dr M'Gillivray still tacksman of that farm?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",109
"110","—Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",110
"111","10222. Do you think he would impose any difficulty now ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",111
"112","—I cannot exactly say as to that. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",112
"113","10223. With regard to the postal and telegraphic communication, have you made representations about postal communication to Government?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",113
"114","— I understand that the chief factor on this estate is present, and he is a man who knows more about that than I do, only I feel the want of it as well as any other man. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",114
"115","10224. And he can give information about the telegraphic wire also?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",115
"116","— Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",116
"117","10225. Does the pounding of the cattle still continue?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",117
"118","—It does. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",118
"119","10226. Does it continue in the same degree, or is it less done than formerly ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",119
"120","—In the same degree, if not increasing. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",120
"121","10227. But do the crofters really do their best to prevent their cattle straying on the tacksman's farm ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",121
"122","—So far as known to me. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",122
"123","10228. Is there any case of a wire fence between the tacksman and the crofter ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",123
"124","—Not that I am aware of. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",124
"125","10229. Not in the whole island?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",125
"126","—Not in the whole island. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",126
"127","10230. You stated that twelve days' labour was exacted for the privilege of getting two small cart-loads of bent. Is that the case on all the tacksmen's farms, or only the case on one?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",127
"128","—Only the case on one, because it is on one farm only that the bent grass grows in sufficient quantity. It grows upon other farms, but not to such an extent. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",128
"129","10231. But the other farmers do not charge anything?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",129
"130","—It is so scarce that they cannot supply us with it. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",130
"131","10232. But for what it is do they charge ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",131
"132","—It is only against the one tacksman that the complaint is made, for he only can supply it. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",132
"133","10233. Is there any complaint about heather ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",133
"134","—There is heather enough. I have had complaints about heather. We use it to roof our houses, and ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",134
"135","I have heard different complaints about that, but I never heard any labour asked in return for the heather. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",135
"136","10234. Is there any complaint about the sea-weed from the shore ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",136
"137","—Not that I ever heard, unless we went over the marches into those big farms. If we did they would ask some payment for it, otherwise some labour. We would not be at liberty to take it away on our cart. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",137
"138","10235. You would not be at liberty to take the sea-weed from the shore Buchanan, of the tacksmen's farms?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",138
"139","—No, unless sanctioned by themselves. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",139
"140","10236. Did you ever hear any case of their refusing the liberty or charging money ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",140
"141","—I have heard of their refusing liberty, but I never heard of any case where they charged money. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",141
"142","10237. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",142
"143","Where is the township of Borv ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",143
"144","—On the west side. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",144
"145","10238. How many families are there in Borv ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",145
"146","—About thirty-six families of crofters, and the exact number of cottars I cannot tell. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",146
"147","10239. Have the thirty-six crofters got the township equally divided among them ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",147
"148","—The township was founded about sixty years ago, and made into fourteen crofts. It is now made into eighteen, and these crofts are in several instances inhabited by four and in general by two. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",148
"149","10240. Are the eighteen crofts equal in size?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",149
"150","—They are equal in size, but not equal in quality of land, and are at different rents. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",150
"151","10241. What has your brother?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",151
"152","—The half of a croft. My forefathers had the same land for the last fifty years. During the runrig system my ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",152
"153","grandfather had a great part of the present croft, and this present croft consists of about eight acres, and we occupy the half of that croft. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",153
"154","10242. You have about four acres?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",154
"155","—Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",155
"156","10243. What do you pay for that?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",156
"157","—£4. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",157
"158","10244. What grazing privileges have you ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",158
"159","—We have only our own part of a small hill; I cannot exactly tell the acreage of it, but it is on the common pasture of the parish for all townships on the east, west, south, and north. It is a central place. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",159
"160","10245. Is there any limit to the number of cattle you can turn out upon it ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",160
"161","—There was in former times, but I cannot exactly say what it was. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",161
"162","10246. What stock do you yourselves turn out on that pasture ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",162
"163","—We have two cows, a heifer, and two working ponies. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",163
"164","10247. Are the other crofters in the township rented in the same proportion ? Do they pay a similar rent for the acreage and stock which they have ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",164
"165","—They do in proportion, but, as I have mentioned, some of the crofts are not the same rent owing to their not being of the same quality. Some pay more rent than we do that have the same acreage, and some pay ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",165
"166","less than we do that have the same acreage. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",166
"167","10248. But I suppose they have more or less stock in those circumstances ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",167
"168","—They have.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",168
"169","10249. Has the population of Borv increased in your time ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",169
"170","—It has, but if the population of Borv were restricted to the local increase of the place there would be quite sufficient land for them; but the township of Borv was the only place where they were huddled into from other places at the time these were cleared. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",170
"171","10250. Do you know how many people were brought in from other townships at the time of these clearances?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",171
"172","—There were fourteen from Green and Cliad ; two from Cregston, a township lying contiguous to Borv; and three from Ollosdale. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",172
"173","10251. Is that all?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",173
"174","—All, with the exception of the increase of men belonging naturally to the place. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",174
"175","10252. When did these clearances take place ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",175
"176","—These men came into the township thirty-five years ago. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",176
"177","10253. Who have those lands of Green, Chad, Cregston, and Ollosdale now ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",177
"178","—Up to the present Whitsunday, Ollosdale was occupied by Donald Macdonald, who succeeded his father, Archibald MacDonald, for whom that township was cleared; Green and Cliad are Dr M'Gillivray's; and those men who came from Cregston were replaced by men from other townships. I mean that Cregston is for the present occupied by crofters. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",178
"179","10254. Who has got Ollosdale ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",179
"180","—I believe it is let to six or seven men, ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",180
"181","10255. Crofters?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",181
"182","—Crofters. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",182
"183","10256. Where were they taken from?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",183
"184","—James Mackinnon, Neil Galbraith, Malcolm M'Leod, and Alexander M'Lean were taken from Borv, ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",184
"185","and Alexander Galbraith from Scalladale; and the parish minister, the Rev. Alexander Macdonald, has got another croft, and the miller has got another. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",185
"186","10257. Were the people who were taken from Borv crofters or cottars? ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",186
"187","—They were crofters. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",187
"188","10258. So there has been an enlargement of the crofts in Borv at the term of Whitsunday ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",188
"189","—The croft which James Mackinnon occupied is let to two other men now. I believe one of these men was removed from his own, and his own was given to another man, Donald Cameron. Donald Cameron held half a croft, and that was given to a man who was along with him, and the other man who was occupying the second half had owned lands before. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",189
"190","10259. Has anybody got a bigger croft than he had before?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",190
"191","—I believe Kenneth M'Cuish got a bigger croft, because another man was removed. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",191
"192","10260. Is that the only benefit to the people ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",192
"193","—That is the only benefit that I know of. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",193
"194","10261. That is the only case of doubling a holding ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",194
"195","—The only case that I know of. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",195
"196","10262. But you have got rid of four people from Borv, and therefore to that extent the pressure of population must be reduced. People who were cottars before have now become crofters ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",196
"197","—Only one that I am aware of—Hugh M'Lean—who got half a croft. I understand he was a cottar ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",197
"198","before. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",198
"199","10263. Would the people of Borv wish to be removed to another part of the island ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",199
"200","—I did not consult the men's mind as to that, but for my own part I believe the rest of them would be removed to any part of the parish where their condition would be better. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",200
"201","10264. Yes, of course ; but in what part of the parish would their condition be better ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",201
"202","—I believe their condition would be better either at Poll or Kilbarr, or Scarival or Vaslin, or Cliad or Ardvore. or Orradh or Bogach-na-forla, or Rulisor Sandray or Vatersay, or Uy or Caolas, or Bentangaval. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",202
"203","10265. In whose possession are the places you have mentioned?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",203
"204","—Some of them are presently in the possession of Dr M'Gillivray, and others in the possession of Roderick M'Lellan; and the present tacksman of Vatersay is Donald M'Donald. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",204
"205","10266. How long has Dr M'Gillivray been in possession?—I believe he was in possession of Poll, Kilbarr, and some of these other places a long time, but only in possession of the rest for the last thirty-five or thirty-six ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",205
"206","years. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",206
"207","10267. There is no part of these places but what he has had for thirty-five or thirty-six years ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",207
"208","—That is so. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",208
"209","10268. You say that Dr M'Gillivray demands sixty days' labour for an acre of potato ground ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",209
"210","—Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",210
"211","10269. Is that male or female labour?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",211
"212","—Both. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",212
"213","10270. Does he take it in either?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",213
"214","—Whenever he wants service to be done, there are some families in which there are no males, and in such ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",214
"215","cases the women go and work.  ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",215
"216","10271. He will take sixty days of a man's work or sixty days of a woman's  work ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",216
"217","—I only say he takes sixty days' average for an acre of land, but in small odd cases women are working as well as men.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",217
"218","10272. If he takes a woman, does he increase the number of days?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",218
"219","—I don't think he does.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",219
"220","10273. Do people take a whole acre at that rate, or only a small patch ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",220
"221","— If one man does not do it, eight do. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",221
"222","10274. They take the eighth of an acre each?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",222
"223","—No, but each takes the planting of a barrel of potatoes, and we always calculate an acre to plant ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",223
"224","about eight barrels. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",224
"225","10275. What return do you get from the eight barrels?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",225
"226","—Sometimes we get about eight barrels, ten or twelve in a good year, and some years hardly double the seed put in. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",226
"227","10276. Eight or ten barrels for the one?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",227
"228","—Eight, ten, and sometimes twelve, for the one barrel; but in a great many cases not double the quantity of the seed we plant ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",228
"229","10277. But in an ordinarily good season ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",229
"230","—In an ordinarily good season we get generally eight or nine barrels. In extra seasons we get about that. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",230
"231","10278. Do you know how long Dr M'Gillivray has had his tack?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",231
"232","—I cannot say how long it is since he occupied the farm of Eoligary, but I should say it is thirty-five or thirty-six years since he got all these places I have mentioned. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",232
"233","10279. When will his lease be out?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",233
"234","—I cannot say. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",234
"235","10280. Mr Cameron.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",235
"236","How many crofters do you represent here ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",236
"237","—I represent about thirty-six crofters. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",237
"238","10281. Is that the whole number of crofters on the island?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",238
"239","—The whole number of crofters in the township of Borv. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",239
"240","10282. But you told us there was only six or seven present at the meeting when you were elected a delegate ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",240
"241","—From the township of Borv. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",241
"242","10283. Do you know why the other thirty were not there?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",242
"243","—They were employed elsewhere, only they gave their consent. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",243
"244","10284. In what form did they give their consent ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",244
"245","—They gave their consent in such a form as this : As we have to go elsewhere to attend our ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",245
"246","respective services, we give you our consent to elect whom you like.' ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",246
"247","10285. Was that in writing?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",247
"248","—I cannot exactly say whether it was or not. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",248
"249","10286. Could not the meeting have been held at some period of the day or some day of the week when more people might have been present?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",249
"250","— They all go to work. Whenever the bills came here and were posted up, the news went rapidly through the whole parish of Barra, and they commenced to gather from the different cantonments. They were there from our township, as many as were necessary, and there was a meeting held in the class-room, and the question was put to them, and they said they were there representing those who remained at home as well as those who had come. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",250
"251","10287. In any case, out of thirty-six, only six or seven managed to be present at this meeting ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",251
"252","—That was all I saw present. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",252
"253","10288. Might not a day or an hour have been fixed when more could have been present ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",253
"254","—The bills were posted on a Saturday, and as hurriedly as we could we passed the word through the parish, and as many gathered here as could. A great many were not coming to the island till Sunday morning. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",254
"255","10289. Was there not time to arrange for a more largely attended meeting ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",255
"256","—That was all the time. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",256
"257","10290. Do you mean there was no time to arrange for a more largely attended meeting?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",257
"258","—I tell you I saw the bill on the Saturday, but a great many of them did not, and I intimated seeing such a bill, and told them to do something to meet the Royal Commission. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",258
"259","10291. You stated in answer to the Chairman that you and the people, whom you represent complain of the oppression of landlords and factors. Do you complain of the present oppression of landlords and factors, or do you refer to a period before you were born?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",259
"260","—I partly refer to a period before I was born, and that upon good authority, but in general to the period after I was born. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",260
"261","10292. As you have heard from the factor here that you will not be put in any worse position in consequence of what you state to the Commission, perhaps you will mention some of the oppression on the part of the factor beyond what you mentioned in answer to the Chairman ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",261
"262","—I think I have stated all the acts of oppression voluntarily that I can presently remember. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",262
"263","10293. You have no definite or distinct act of oppression committed by the landlord or factor that you can remember, except in regard to the stirk being sold and the money not credited to the tenant ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",263
"264","—There was another particular case belonging to the township I represent 1 can scarcely call it a very hard case. There was a woman named Isabella M'Lauchlan in Borv, about two years ago, who had sublet a bit of land, and she wanted the use of the whole of the land herself. The woman to whom she had sublet the land would not part with it, and the matter became a factor's affair, and I believe the factor said it would be better they should settle it themselves, otherwise he would turn out the woman who had been first in ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",264
"265","possession of the land. Then Isabella M'Lauchlan's son went to pay the rent, and John Macdonald refused to receive it, on account, I believe, of non-compliance with the factor's request. I believe the woman got a ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",265
"266","removal summons, but of late years she was reinstated in half of the croft by Mr Macdonald, the chief factor. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",266
"267","10294. Then, in point of fact, she was not removed?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",267
"268","—She was removed, but she got another croft. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",268
"269","10295. And you said that you did not consider that a great case of hardship ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",269
"270","—Not a great case of hardship, when I saw the woman get the land. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",270
"271","10296. I want to ask you about the stirk. Do I understand that the factor took the stirk away from the crofter and sold it on pretence that the proceeds would be credited to him for payment of the rent due, and that the proceeds were not credited to him for the rent due?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",271
"272","—I say he did. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",272
"273","10297. Do you know whether it ever occurred to the crofter to put the matter into the hands of the procurator-fiscal ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",273
"274","—He did not do that. He was afraid that if he did so he would be worse off and only double his own misfortune. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",274
"275","10298. Does it not occur to you, if the statement you have made is correct, that it was more a question for the procurator-fiscal than it is for the Royal Commission ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",275
"276","—You know that best, your Honour, only I had to state it. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",276
"277","10299. You said the horses and cows were taken away from you forty-two years ago, and the stirks thirty-seven years ago ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",277
"278","—Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",278
"279","10300. Where did the stirks come from if the cows were taken away five years previously ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",279
"280","—There were some men whose stock was cleared completely away, and some men to whom perhaps a cow or so was left. There is a man in the township of Tangasdale from whom nine head of cattle were taken that same year. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",280
"281","10301. As a rule, do the crofters in this island not possess cows?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",281
"282","—A great many do not possess cows. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",282
"283","10302. What has been your occupation all your life ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",283
"284","—My occupation was crofting and fishing.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",284
"285","10303. Have you been all your life in the island ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",285
"286","—All my life. I have often been away, but I never remained a year away without visiting it.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",286
"287","10304. When the lease of Mr M 'Lellan fell out, did the crofters make any application for the farm ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",287
"288","—Yes, some of them did. The crofters of the township of Glen did, and a deputation went and waited upon ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",288
"289","the chief factor, Mr Macdonald, in Aberdeen. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",289
"290","10305. Did he give any reason for not giving the farm to the crofters?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",290
"291","—I am not aware of that. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",291
"292","10306. You saw the correspondence in the newspapers upon the subject ? ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",292
"293","—I did. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",293
"294","10307. When did the kelp manufacture cease here ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",294
"295","—I cannot exactly say in what year, but it went on here during the late Colonel Gordon's time, and abundantly in the time of the late General M 'Neill. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",295
"296","10308. Did it go on subsequently to the year 1827?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",296
"297","—It did. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",297
"298","10309 Was not the cessation of the kelp manufacture the principal cause of the poverty of the people in the island ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",298
"299","— I do not think it was ; it was partly. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",299
"300","10310 To what do you attribute it, if it was not due to the disappearance of the kelp manufacture ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",300
"301","—I attribute it to the following reasons, to the famine that followed the failure of the potato crop, coupled with the doings of the factors, studying not the interest of the crofters or cottars. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",301
"302","10311. Do you think the people could live by the island here entirely ? ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",302
"303","—I think so. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",303
"304","10 312. Do you think there is land enough to support a population of 3000?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",304
"305","—I can safely say there is. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",305
"306","10313. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",306
"307","You have lived here, you say, all your days ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",307
"308","—Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",308
"309","10314. And your predecessors before you, for about eighty years ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",309
"310","—Yes, on the same land and mostly in the same house. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",310
"311","10315. You gave us as an important date, the year 1827, before which things were in a favourable condition. Who was the proprietor before 1827?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",311
"312","—It was the late General M 'Neill—R oderick M'Neill—the sixth Roderick M 'Neill. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",312
"313","10316. Was the property sold in 1827 ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",313
"314","—It was not sold, it was let by the late General M 'Neill. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",314
"315","10 317. When was it sold ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",315
"316","—About forty-two or forty-three years ago. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",316
"317","10318. That would be about 1840. Now, there have been extensive evictions and clearances from this estate at different times?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",317
"318","—There were. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",318
"319","10319. When did these begin?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",319
"320","—About thirty-five or thirty-six years ago. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",320
"321","10320. Were there any at all in the time of the M'Neills?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",321
"322","—Not that I am aware of, except from Poll and Kilbarr. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",322
"323","10321. Were these upon an extensive scale ?—No, the people were only moved up to the adjacent townships. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",323
"324","10322. May I take it that all the townships which you stated might be given back were cleared ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",324
"325","—You are quite safe in doing so. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",325
"326","10323. Were there circumstances of great hardships in connection with some of the evictions ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",326
"327","—Heart-rending. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",327
"328","10324. Take the last one, which probably occurred within your own recollection ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",328
"329","—I have seen with my own eyes the roof of the house actually falling down upon the fire, and smoke issuing. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",329
"330","10325. The houses were knocked down?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",330
"331","—Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",331
"332","10326 Are you aware, in connection with the last eviction, that the people when they arrived in Canada were in a most miserable condition,  dependent upon charity ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",332
"333","—I have seen that stated in public prints. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",333
"334","10327. Do the people here occasionally receive letters from some of those who were evicted ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",334
"335","—Occasionally, but not very often. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",335
"336","10328. Do you know how they are getting on ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",336
"337","—I believe two or three per cent, got on pretty fair, but the rest we receive very bad accounts of. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",337
"338","10329. Do you know how many fighting men the old M'Neills of Barra could take out ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",338
"339","—Two hundred men, so far as I am aware. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",339
"340","10330. Had they any property besides Barra ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",340
"341","—In former times the Barra estate extended as far as North Boisdale. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",341
"342","10331. That was part of South Uist?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",342
"343","—Yes; to the north march of Boisdale,—the march of Boisdale and Kilphedar. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",343
"344","10332. And all that was the M'Neill's property?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",344
"345","—Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",345
"346","10333. Can you give me a list of the local factors upon the property since the Gordons acquired it, and the length of time they held office?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",346
"347","—There was a man named Webster. I think he was a south country man. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",347
"348","10334. He was not a Barra man?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",348
"349","—No; so far as I remember, he was not a Highlander. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",349
"350","10335. Had he any Gaelic?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",350
"351","—I never heard him speaking Gaelic. The next was a man named Robertson. He was a stranger also,—I think, a Perthshire man. The next was a man named Clark, a stranger; then there were Fleming, Young, George Gordon, John Rule, William Birnie, then Drever, Taylor, Barron, and now Mr Forbes Phillips. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",351
"352","10336. These were all strangers?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",352
"353","—Yes. I forgot to mention Dr M'Leod, who was not a stranger, but a very well known gentleman. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",353
"354","10337. Sheriff Nicolson.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",354
"355","He was factor for Lord Macdonald?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",355
"356","—Yes, at the same time. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",356
"357","10338. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",357
"358","Then all these people have been factors since the acquisition of the property by the late Colonel Gordon?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",358
"359","—Yes, and Mr Macdonald into the bargain. He is not a stranger. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",359
"360","10339. Was there not some local person of the name of Thomson farmer here a year ago? ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",360
"361","—No, his name was Barron. He left lately, and Mr Phillips succeeded him. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",361
"362","10340. Did the people present him with a testimonial?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",362
"363","—I think they did. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",363
"364","10341. And he made a speech to them in reply?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",364
"365","—I was not present, and did not hear it. It may have been in another place; but I was present when subscriptions were received. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",365
"366","10342. Did he not thank them when the presentation was made?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",366
"367","—I did not hear. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",367
"368","10343. Are you aware he stated at any time here that he gave up his position because he could not agree with some things that were going on ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",368
"369","—I am not aware of that. I have heard that Mr Walker, South Uist, made such a remark. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",369
"370","10344. Professor Mackinnon.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",370
"371","You have two local factors just now, one in South Uist and one in Barra ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",371
"372","—Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",372
"373","10345. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",373
"374","What is the value of a day's labour here to a man if he gets a day's work to do ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",374
"375","—The value of a man's labour here among big farmers is a shilling. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",375
"376","10346. Then, according to that, Dr M'Gillivray gets at the rate of £ 3 per acre, being sixty days at one shilling a day ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",376
"377","—Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",377
"378","10347. Do you consider that a high rent?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",378
"379","—I do. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",379
"380","10348. Have you any idea of the extent of Dr M'Gillivray's farm?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",380
"381","—I suppose he occupies about 6000 acres. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",381
"382","10349. Has he a number of cottars?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",382
"383","—None that I am aware of, except shepherds and servants. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",383
"384","10350. What may be the amount of population upon his farm?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",384
"385","—He has seven shepherds besides his own domestic servants. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",385
"386","10351. There will be about fifty altogether ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",386
"387","—I cannot exactly say. . ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",387
"388","10352. What proportion does his farm bear to the whole island ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",388
"389","—Pretty well on to the half of the island, and the best half. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",389
"390","10353. And the other islands?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",390
"391","—The other islands. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",391
"392","10354. I want to get some information about Vatersay. Was it advertised in the newspapers for people to offer ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",392
"393","—It was advertised in the newspapers to be let. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",393
"394","10355. Did a deputation from the islands here go to Lady Gordon Cathcart for the purpose of getting it ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",394
"395","—No, they went to wait upon Mr Macdonald, the chief factor, at Aberdeen. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",395
"396","10356. How many went ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",396
"397","—Three. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",397
"398","10357. Were you one of them ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",398
"399","—No. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",399
"400","10358. Did they want to be transported bodily to that island, with their houses, or was it merely as grazing that they wanted it ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",400
"401","—I believe they considered themselves quite transported as they were, but they wanted to get over there to better their condition. They wanted to go and live there. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",401
"402","10359. How many made the application?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",402
"403","—I cannot say, but I believe mostly all inhabitants of Glen and Castle Bay. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",403
"404","10360. Are these two towns very much crowded ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",404
"405","—They are not exactly two towns. This bight is Castle Bay, and the contiguous township is Glen. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",405
"406","10361. Did they want the proprietrix to build houses for them?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",406
"407","—I don't think they did. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",407
"408","10362. This place, Castle Bay, seems to be very rugged and rocky. There does not seem to be any cultivation at all.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",408
"409","—It is very rocky and rugged, and the green patches which there are are very bleak, barren, and sterile ground. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",409
"410","10363. Were there any people at one time on Vatersay ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",410
"411","—Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",411
"412","10364. Is the land there capable of cultivation?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",412
"413","—The finest land on the island. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",413
"414","10365. What was the story about there being no sufficient supply of water on the island ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",414
"415","—I heard that, but I do not think it is true. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",415
"416","10366. Don't you suppose the people themselves studied the matter very thoroughly before they made application ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",416
"417","—I think they did ; but I am aware of three spring wells there, which with a little labour would supply ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",417
"418","water to the island. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",418
"419","10367. Was her Ladyship ever upon the island?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",419
"420","—I cannot say; it was only once I ever saw her here. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",420
"421","10368. She did not state of her own knowledge that there was no water ? ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",421
"422","—I cannot exactly say whether she did or not. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",422
"423","10369. With regard to Dr M'Gillivray wanting twelve days' labour for bent, does the bent grow naturally, or was it planted ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",423
"424","—It grows naturally, and grew naturally. It was never planted in that place. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",424
"425","10370. Bent is very useful for keeping sand together?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",425
"426","—Yes, and the more cutting among the bent the better growth. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",426
"427","10371. Would all the cuttings the people require do any harm to the proper growth of the bent as a proper protection against the sand bank increasing ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",427
"428","—It merely encourages growth. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",428
"429","10372. Then what possible reason could Dr M'Gillivray have for exacting such a large sum as that for a thing that was of no use to himself ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",429
"430","—I cannot say, if it was not to get his own work done at as little expense as he could. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",430
"431","10373. That is the only solution you can give ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",431
"432","—Yes",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",432
"433","10374. Has Dr M'Gillivray got anything added to his tack within the last ten years ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",433
"434","—Not that I am aware of.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",434
"435","10375. Professor Mackinnon.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",435
"436","—You said that if you had to go for sea ware on the shore you would have to pay for it to the tacksman. Have you not sufficient sea-ware on your own shore?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",436
"437","—No, we have not; and I will tell you how. It is cast sea-ware that we get. It is very much owing to the drift, and is more liable to be drawn ashore on the strand adjacent to the big farm.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",437
"438","10376. Have any of the crofters got sheep ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",438
"439","—Yes.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",439
"440","10377. How many has your brother ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",440
"441","—About eight sheep.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",441
"442","10378. Do they stray to the neighbouring farm of Dr M'Gillivray?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",442
"443","—They do.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",443
"444","10379. Do any of his sheep come your way?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",444
"445","—Yes.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",445
"446","10380. Do you pound them ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",446
"447","—No, we do not take any notice of them.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",447
"448","10381. Why do you not pound them ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",448
"449","—That is a question I cannot exactly answer.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",449
"450","10382. Do they come as often your way as yours go his way ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",450
"451","—They come equally our way.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",451
"452","10383. So that his sheep get free upon your pasture, and yours are pounded upon his ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",452
"453","—Yes. I account for it in this way, that if I had anything against Dr M'Gillivray, perhaps I might have to go to him for a favour to-morrow, and it is not very likely I would get it.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",453
"454","10384. He is the only one to supply you with bent?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",454
"455","—Yes.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",455
"456","10385. About the cockles ; supposing you were to use them now, would the tacksman object?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",456
"457","—I cannot say whether he would or not.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",457
"458","10386. But he objected before?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",458
"459","—He objected before.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",459
"460","10387. The factor did not ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",460
"461","—The factor did not.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",461
"462","10388. How long were you away from the island ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",462
"463","—I was several times away from the island, but I never remained away from the island the whole year.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",463
"464","10389. I suppose you got your education in the parish school here?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",464
"465","—Yes, under Mr Arbuckle, the parish schoolmaster.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",465
"466","10390. You said you understood from the public prints that the emigrants were pretty badly off when they arrived in Canada. Was there an account of the same nature sent home by the people themselves to their friends ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",466
"467","—Very much the same.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",467
"468","10391. So it was the general belief in the place that the account in the newspapers was upon the whole true ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",468
"469","—It was the general opinion of the people here that the account in the public prints was true, because they",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",469
"470","attributed a great deal to the treatment they saw the men getting before they emigrated at all.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",470
"471","10392. Was there anything peculiar that happened at the time the horses and cows were taken away ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",471
"472","—Yes ; there was a Spaniard lying wrecked on the strand adjacent to Tangasdale. Well, the very man I refer to who took the cattle forcibly away made the men work about that ship. She was loaded with fish, and the fish became quite useless ; and the people thought they could make, use of the fish. They were not allowed to do that until such time as it was mostly taken away by the tide ; but I believe he made them labour a great deal about that ship, and never gave them wages,—at least I understood that from the men who worked.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",472
"473","10393. There are not so many wrecks now?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",473
"474","—No.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",474
"475","10394. Is it the lighthouse that has prevented that?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",475
"476","—It may be attributed to it.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",476
"477","10395. Is that a loss to the place?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",477
"478","—I don't think it is.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",478
"479","10396. Now, about the man's stirk, you say the man is here whose stirk was taken away and given back to him on payment of 7s. ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",479
"480","—Given back to his wife. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",480
"481","10397. Were all the people drinking ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",481
"482","—Yes, they were all drinking; andI believe they were there for a good long time the following morning. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",482
"483","10398. And the wife would not get back the stirk without the 7s.'?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",483
"484","— No. I have also to state, in conclusion, that there was a very severe remark passed one day we came to Castle Bay to meet the chief factor. There were some gentlemen present, who called us privately—but I was within hearing— Fenians, and we were not very well pleased to hear ourselves called Fenians. We do not like the name. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",484
"485","10399. Sheriff Nicolson.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",485
"486","Have your ideas been in any way influenced by what you have heard from Ireland ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",486
"487","—Not in the least, I am not an Irishman, neither have I imbibed their notions. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",487
"488","10400. Do many of the Barra men go to the Kinsale fishing?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",488
"489","—None, all to the east coast.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",489
"490","10401. Who was it that called them Fenians ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",490
"491","—The medical practitioner of this island. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",491
"492","10402. I suppose the people here are not much given to law ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",492
"493","—No, they are very simple, harmless people. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",493
"494","10403. If any man has a case against another, where does he go for an agent?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",494
"495","—He goes nowhere for an agent. In particular cases they might apply to the procurator-fiscal. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",495
"496","10404. For that purpose have they to go all the way to Loch Maddy?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",496
"497","— Yes. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",497
"498","10405. Then do you think they suffer any injustice from the want of lawyers near them ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",498
"499","—I cannot eay, but I know it is bringing very unnecessary expense upon them. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",499
"500","10406. When they have to go all the way to Loch Maddy ?—Yes ; it is a long and dreary way to walk, and they have to cross two ferries ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",500
"501","10407. Is there any agent there except the fiscal ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",501
"502","—None, except a man of business, whose name I think is Wilson, and, if I remember right, they are in company. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",502
"503","10408. So only one side of a case can be heard at Loch Maddy ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",503
"504","—That is all I understand about it. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",504
"505","10409. How long does it take to go to Loch Maddy?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",505
"506","—For my part, I would take about two days going there. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",506
"507","10410. I suppose you would rather lose something than go on such business?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",507
"508","—I would, by far. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",508
"509","10411. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",509
"510","—You were asked by Lochiel about the number of people who seut you here. Has there been anybody consulting with or advising or directing you from the outside to the steps you should take in coming here to-day ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",510
"511","—None whatever. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",511
"512","10412. Did the clergyman of the place, or the priest, or others, interfere in any way or assist you in getting up your meeting?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",512
"513","—They did not interfere in any way, only they were very encouraging to us by coming and sitting along with the people. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",513
"514","10413. The priest was present at your meeting?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",514
"515","—He was present. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",515
"516","10414. And you are quite prepared to state that the proceedings in the schoolhouse, as regards the appointment of the delegates, truly represented the feelings of the crofters throughout the whole of the island ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",516
"517","—I am quite prepared to say that, and it was quite a legal affair, and we kept a copy of the sederunt. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",517
"518","10415. Who wrote out the paper that was signed by the chairman ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",518
"519","—A merchant's clerk. ",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",519
"520","10416. Now, is it the case that, from the state of matters in this island, it is practically impossible for the crofters to do anything but submit to whatever the proprietor or factor may put upon them ?",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",520
"521","—Owing to the position in which the people are, it was ever a very prevalent idea on this island that they would have to obey their superiors, particularly landlords and factors; and, I believe, should they wish to do anything, they could scarcely do it without consulting either landlord or factor, whether to their own benefit or to the reverse.",176,"Michael Buchanan","Barra, Castlebay",521
