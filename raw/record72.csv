"1","DONALD M 'PHEE, Crofter and Mason, Roag (74)—examined. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",1
"2","4128. The Chairman.",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",2
"3","—How long have you been a crofter?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",3
"4","—I have been paying rent during the last fifty-two years. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",4
"5","4129. Have you been freely chosen a delegate by the people of Roag ? ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",5
"6","—Yes. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",6
"7","4130 Have you a statement which you wish to make on the part of the people of Roag ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",7
"8","—At one time the place on which I now am was in possession of my father and my uncle, and to-day there are thirteen families upon it. We had sheep and cattle and horses at that time, and we had a wide hill pasture, and when we lost the pasture we could not keep horses or sheep, and the bit of hid pasture that we got we could only keep one cow upon it, and two cows on our lots. When we lost the sheep we had no wool wherewith to make clothing for our families; and when we had no horses to do the work, our women had to do it—dragging the harrows with a rope about their shoulders, helping the men with forks and spades in digging the ground. Now, if we would have given us a place on which we could keep a horse and a few sheep, which would supply clothing to our families, and sufficient to keep our men at home to work at, the proprietor as well as the people would be benefited. The ground be made more valuable, and we would be better in. consequence. I was hearing about the clothing of the women, the women used to be making good, tidy clothing for themselves and for their husbands at home out of their wool, and there was no occasion for them to buy south country clothing. If they had the wool, there would be no occasion for each woman to imitate the fashions,—the godless fashions of France; and if we would get the land—as much of it as would keep us in comfort— we do not want too much of it at all. We want a proportionate supply of the good things of this life. We would be satisfied with that, and until the poor people get as much of the land as will keep them in such comfort, and till they have as much sheep stock as will keep their families in clothing, they will not be put right. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",8
"9","4131. When the hill pasture was taken away from Roag, what was done with it?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",9
"10","—It was added to the tack of Claggan. The march of Claggan was a river, and there was a burn on this side of it, and when the tacksman got Claggan the march of it was extended to the burn. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",10
"11","4132. You said there were thirteen famdies now at Roag, where did those famdies come from ? Did any of them come from outside, or did they multiply on the ground ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",11
"12","—It was the natural increase of the place, as they had no place to go to. Besides these, there are four cottars in the place who have no land at all, and these are a burden upon the crofters ; and if our holdings were extended, we would all be comfortable. It is the want of land that is causing our poverty. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",12
"13","4133. Professor Mackinnon.",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",13
"14","—You say the people all grew in the place, but I understood you to say that formerly it was held by your own father and uncle. Surely the whole thirteen families did not grow naturally in the place ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",14
"15","—When my father and uncle had it, these others were crowded in upon them. In the time of my father and uncle, these others were so young that they could not make any use of land. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",15
"16","4134. Were they in Roag?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",16
"17","—Yes; they were in families then. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",17
"18","4135. How many of these thirteen families are your own relatives? ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",18
"19","—They are not relatives. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",19
"20","4136. Where did they come from ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",20
"21","—Just in Roag. They were young then. Every one of them belongs to Roag. These people were young at that time, but when they grew up, and married, and had families, they had no other place to go to, and they had to be added to Roag, and some of those are without land still. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",21
"22","4137. Are the thirteen crofts in Roag all divided into equal lots?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",22
"23","— They are the same size, but they are not equally good. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",23
"24","4138. What is the rent ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",24
"25","—The worst of the lots are not so dear. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",25
"26","4139. What do you pay yourself?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",26
"27","—I pay £5, 12s., and two others beside me. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",27
"28","4140. And the others a little less?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",28
"29","—There are others who pay considerably less than that. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",29
"30","4141. What stock does your croft carry?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",30
"31","—Two cows, two calves, and the cow to which I referred, which was kept upon the bit of pasture, but we have no sheep. I have neither sheep nor a horse. We have no place in which to keep them. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",31
"32","4142. Your chief complaint is that the croft is too small ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",32
"33","—Yes ; that is what is the matter with us. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",33
"34","4143. And, of course, if you got a bigger croft, you would be quite able to pay a reasonable rent for it?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",34
"35","—Yes, if we would get hill pasture on which we could keep a few beasts and a horse. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",35
"36","4144. What croft do you think, in that place of your own, would be required in order to make a living on it ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",36
"37","—I think if we had 12 acres of arable land, and as much hill pasture as would enable us to keep twenty-four sheep and a horse, we would be satisfied with that.",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",37
"38","4145. How many cows?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",38
"39","—Four cows, and we would be agreeable again to have our lots valued by valuators. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",39
"40","4146. Suppose you were a valuator yourself upon such a croft, what rent would you think was a reasonable rent for it ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",40
"41","—I am not a valuator. I would be quite satisfied with the valuation of any competent person. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",41
"42","4147. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",42
"43","—What value is an acre of arable land round here to the crofter ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",43
"44","—I do not think it is worth more than 3s. or 4s. to him, the land here is so much run out. During all my experience I have not seen any part of our holdings left uncultivated; for, if we left any part of them uncultivated, we would not have wherewith to feed our stock. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",44
"45","4148. What value do you put upon a sheep's grass and a cow's grass and horse's grass ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",45
"46","—I will tell you the value that is put upon it just now as it is. The grazing of a cow is valued at 5s. on our hill pasture, the grazing being so bad, and 10s. for grazing on our crofts; and we are complaining that that itself is too high. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",46
"47","4149. And for the sheep ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",47
"48","—Six sheep are considered equal to one cow in grazing. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",48
"49","4150. And the horse?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",49
"50","—A horse is equal to two cows. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",50
"51","4151. Professor Mackinnon.",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",51
"52","—Are you old enough to remember the time when your father and uncle had that place themselves ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",52
"53","—Yes. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",53
"54","4152. Were they in the habit, when they were cultivating the ground, of leaving out pieces of it then?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",54
"55","—Yes, the fourth part, and that fourth part when cultivated would be better than double its size of what had been cultivated. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",55
"56","4153. I understand there is a greater number of people in Roag than thirteen or fourteen. How many?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",56
"57","—The place beside me contains five families, and the place on the south of me other five families, and the other end six families. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",57
"58","4154. Are they all much in the same condition in which you are yourself1?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",58
"59","— Yes, not one better than I have said. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",59
"60","4155. If they were to get reasonably sized crofts, is there land in the district that you could get for them ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",60
"61","—No, but there is a tack beside us, the lease of which is nearly out, and that tack would put right in their circumstances the whole of M'Leod's crofters. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",61
"62","4156. Are there many of the people about yourself who would be able to take such a croft?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",62
"63","—Yes. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",63
"64","4157 Could they put the stock upon it?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",64
"65","—No, they could not stock such a croft without help. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",65
"66","4158. But there are some who could stock it?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",66
"67","—There are some. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",67
"68","4159. Then they would be prepared to pay a reasonable rent for such a croft ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",68
"69","—Yes, that is what they want. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",69
"70","4160. Do you think they would pay the present rent that is paid for it ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",70
"71","—It is likely they would. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",71
"72","4161. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",72
"73","—Have you been away from the country as a mason ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",73
"74","—Yes. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",74
"75","4162. Where have you been working?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",75
"76","—Galloway, Caithness, and Sutherland, and in the south country at mason work. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",76
"77","4163. We have been told that in some other places the people spend a good deal of money on tea. Is that the case in your township of Roag ? ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",77
"78","—I believe they take tea indeed now, but in my young days they did not know anything about tea and they did not need it. They had milk and cheese and flesh, and the tea was not of much account with them. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",78
"79","4164. Can you state from your own knowledge that the children suffer from scarcity of milk ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",79
"80","—Yes, I know that fully ; and I heard Dr M'Leod also noticed that when the children ceased to be getting the milk and other good food, and were taking tea, they were deteriorating. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",80
"81","4165. Who was Dr M'Leod?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",81
"82","—Dr M'Leod, Portree formoriy factor for Lord Macdonald. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",82
"83","4166. Is he long dead?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",83
"84","—It is not much more than twenty year., since he died. I was working in Ramsaig when he died. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",84
"85","4167. Have you been present all day ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",85
"86","—Yes. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",86
"87","4168. Have you any complaint such as we have heard in other places of the people being obliged to offer their cattle to the landlord first, or being obliged to go to a store, or anything of that kind ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",87
"88","—No. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",88
"89","4169. As I understand, your complaint is altogether want of pasture and the scrimpiness of your crofts ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",89
"90","—Yes ; and M'Leod of M'Leod was always so kind to people who had been driven from other places, that he would give them a place on his own property. When Minginish and Talisker were in the possession of one man, the tacksman expelled the one family that was left upon the tack. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",90
"91","4170. Which tack ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",91
"92","—Talisker. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",92
"93","4171. What was done with the famdy !",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",93
"94","—They got a place from M'Leod of M'Leod in Roag. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",94
"95","4172. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",95
"96","—Do you think the children are worse off than they were at the time Dr M'Leod spoke to you!",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",96
"97","—I think that they are not at all so strong or so healthy as they were then. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",97
"98","4173. I mean, are they worse off for milk ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",98
"99","—Yes, very much worse than in Dr M'Leod's time. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",99
"100","4174. Professor Mackinnon.",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",100
"101","—Suppose they got the crofts you were talking of, do you think they would give up the tea, and revert to the milk again ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",101
"102","—I do not think they would. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",102
"103","4175. I suppose you would do everything yourself to bring that state of matters about ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",103
"104","—Yes. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",104
"105","4176. Are there a large number without land at all in Roag ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",105
"106","—Yea. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",106
"107","4177. I am told about fifteen or sixteen?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",107
"108","—There are four on my own lot without land. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",108
"109","4178. Are these without even a cow?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",109
"110","—They are without a cow, but they have a hen or two. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",110
"111","4179. Mr Cameron.",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",111
"112","—How long ago was the hill grazing taken from Roag and given to Claggan ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",112
"113","—It is a long while since then ; about forty years ago. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",113
"114","4180. Have you any rule on the estate as to subdivision of crofts?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",114
"115","— The rule was that, however much the croft would be subdivided, only one house was to be upon it. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",115
"116","4181. How was it that rule was broken in the case of Roag?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",116
"117","—That rule is not broken yet. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",117
"118","4182. But if originally there were only your father and your uncle, and now there are thirteen families, it must have been broken?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",118
"119","—The rule was made when it came to be thirteen families. ",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",119
"120","4183. What are the French fashions you object to ?",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",120
"121","—The fashions the women have, and they used to look nice and tidy before this fashion of carrying bags at their backs.",72,"Donald Mcphee","Skye, Dunvegan",121
