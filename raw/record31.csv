"1","ANGUS M'INNES, Grocer and Merchant, Beinsoraig (60)—examined. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",1
"2","1893. The Chairman.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",2
"3","—Have you been long here?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",3
"4","—Since 1857.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",4
"5","1894. Have you been elected a delegate by the people?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",5
"6","—A delegate from South Cuil. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",6
"7","1895. You produce a statement with which you have been entrusted ? ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",7
"8","—Yes. It is as follows :",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",8
"9","—'We the tenants of South Cuil, eight in number, beg to state our grievances and our demands before the Royal Commissioners, which are the following:",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",9
"10","(1) We want an increase of land, our lots being inadequate to support our families. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",10
"11","(2) The ground is so weak by perpetual tillage that it does not yield crops as it was wont to do, the weather haviug very much changed of late years, so that the fertility of the ground is washed down by incessant rains towards the Uig Bay. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",11
"12","(3) We also respectfully request a permanent lowering of the rents, fixity of tenure, compensation for improvements, and payment of unexhausted manures in case of removal. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",12
"13","(4) We would also respectfully suggest that it is essential to the well-being of a tenant that he would have as much land as would enable him to keep a horse, otherwise he will often find himself compelled to do the work of that useful animal. The number of our stock was taken, but betwixt obligations to our proprietor, meal-dealers, shoemakers, and merchants, it will be soon exhausted.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",13
"14","MARY M'LEOD, Widow STEWART, RODERICK M'DONALD, JOHN GILLIES, ANGUS ROSS, JOHN CAMPBELL, HUGH MACDONALD.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",14
"15","1896. Have you any statement which you wish to make besides on your own part ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",15
"16","—No, I have nothing, unless I confirm what is already stated, that the people require more land, and that the ground is very much deteriorated in wet weather. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",16
"17","1897. What is the nature of the trade you do here ? What do you sell ? ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",17
"18","—I sell tea, sugar, and general groceries; I am a general dealer, only I have no soft goods at present. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",18
"19","1898. From your experience, can you state that the people are poorer than they were at a previous period?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",19
"20","—Yes, I can. They are getting poorer every year. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",20
"21","1899. Do you think that the amount of their purchases is diminished? ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",21
"22","—Their purchases, of course, are scattered. They deal only with me in smalls, and they get their larger requirements from Portree, Glasgow, and other places. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",22
"23","1900. But do you find that the inhabitants here purchase less",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",23
"24","—that they buy fewer commodities which you sell than they formerly did?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",24
"25","—I am sure they do. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",25
"26","1901. They buy less?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",26
"27","—They buy less. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",27
"28","1902. Do they pay as readily, or are they less able to pay than they were in former times ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",28
"29","—Less able, but they are as willing, if they were able to do it. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",29
"30","1903. Do you sell meal and tea?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",30
"31","—Yes. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",31
"32","1904. Have you any land yourself?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",32
"33","—Not just now. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",33
"34","1905. You live entirely by trade ^",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",34
"35","—Exactly so.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",35
"36","1906. Mr Cameron.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",36
"37","—Is the population less than it used to be in former times ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",37
"38","—No, I do not think it, for some time back.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",38
"39","1907. Have you many bad debts in your books ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",39
"40","—Yes, a good deal.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",40
"41","1908. More than you used to have?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",41
"42","—Not of the production of this year, or last year, but from perhaps ten or twelve years ago. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",42
"43","1909. Do the people in this district get much work?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",43
"44","—No, there is no work at all, unless they do it for themselves. There is no public work. That is one of the great evils the people complain of. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",44
"45","1910. Do many of them go south to get work?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",45
"46","—Yes, a great many, especially to the fishing stations in Ireland, the Isle of Man, and on the east coast. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",46
"47","1911. Do you find they bring back more money to the place than they used to do, or less money ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",47
"48","—Less money, because the fishing has been a failure for years past. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",48
"49","1912. Do many go to the herring fishing at the Long Island ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",49
"50","—Not so many to the Long Island as to other places. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",50
"51","1913. And the fishing this year has been less productive than it was formerly ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",51
"52","—Almost a failure. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",52
"53","1914. To what other places do the people go to get work besides the fishing?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",53
"54","—To the south. They used to go to the south—to the railroads and other public works.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",54
"55","1915. Do they go less than they used to go ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",55
"56","—Yes, because the railroads are mostly finished, compared with what they were in 1846 and 1847. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",56
"57","1916. Are they fond of working on the railways?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",57
"58","—They are fond of working at anything remunerative.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",58
"59","1917. But not many of them go south to get ordinary field work—farming work ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",59
"60","—A good many of them, both male and female.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",60
"61","1918. Do you find they go there as much as formerly?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",61
"62","—No, because the work is not so general there as it used to be in former times. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",62
"63","1919. And those that go, do they bring back more money than they formerly did?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",63
"64","—I do not think so, because the times are not what they were when the railways were busy.. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",64
"65","1920. What did they use to get when the railways were busy?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",65
"66","—I wrought on the railway for 13s. a week, and I wrought on it for 5s. a day. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",66
"67","1921. It varied from 13s. a week to 5s. a day?'",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",67
"68","—Yes, but not at the same time. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",68
"69","1922. What is the rate of wages they get at other works 1 Do they do much road making in the south ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",69
"70","—I cannot tell what wages they get at the road making, if there is such in the south just now. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",70
"71","1923. Do you find that the same people go back again, year after year, to the same place, or do they have to seek for work each year as it comes? ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",71
"72","—They go to the same place, generally to the fishing stations, because it is what answers them best. They require to attend to their duties at home till they get the peats cut, and then they are at home again at their harvest operations, in time for looking after their corn crops. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",72
"73","1924. In fact, not many of the people in your district get work in the south except fishing ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",73
"74","—Well, I am not aware that they do. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",74
"75","1925. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",75
"76","—You commenced to trade here in 1857?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",76
"77","—Yes.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",77
"78","1926. Were you selling on credit or ready money ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",78
"79","—I have sold on credit more than I should have done, but I prefer ready money. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",79
"80","1927. But you supply still upon credit ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",80
"81","—Very little; I only sell a little. I don't sell much. I sell on credit, but not as a system. I sell on credit sometimes in spite of myself. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",81
"82","1928. You cannot refuse a poor person?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",82
"83","—Once I give it away, it will be on credit then.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",83
"84","1929. Once you give it away, it will be on credit ever?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",84
"85","—In cases. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",85
"86","1930. Taking ten years ago, how much in the year would you call the bad debts at that time?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",86
"87","—I was taking a piece of land in connection with the little dealing I had, and so I could not exactly form an estimate. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",87
"88","1931. Do you think you make more bad debts now than you did when you first commenced ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",88
"89","—Of course I made more bad debts when I gave out my goods ; I do not give out so much now as I used to do. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",89
"90","1932. But, in proportion to what you give, do you make more bad debts than you did ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",90
"91","—Well the people are strictly honest, if they were able to meet their debts. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",91
"92","1933. I don't throw any doubt on their honesty; it is only their ability I speak of?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",92
"93","—Their ability is declining year after year. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",93
"94","1934. Do you know that because you are making more bad debts?---I will not make more bad debts, because I am not so lavish in giving. I do not give so much as I used to do. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",94
"95","1935. I only want to know in what way you yourself know their ability is diminished ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",95
"96","—It is very easy for me to know that. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",96
"97","1936. Sheriff Nicolson.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",97
"98","—Has there been a large increase in the sale of tea and sugar during the last twenty years?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",98
"99","—Yes: that was in consequence of the failure of the potatoes to a great degree. What else could the poor people do unless they got a cup of tea, when they had no potatoes ? ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",99
"100","1937. Have they tea in every crofter's house regularly?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",100
"101","—Not regularly. It cannot be regularly; and I consider that those who have plenty of milk do not require tea so much. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",101
"102","1938. There used to be considerable cod and ling fishing?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",102
"103","—Yes, but it's quite a failure for this year and last year. There is not a cod this year where they used to be. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",103
"104","1939. But that fishing has not ceased altogether?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",104
"105","—It has ceased. There was not a cod to be dried this year. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",105
"106","1940. Is there any fish-curer in the district to take the fish?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",106
"107","—It used to be taken by different persons at different times. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",107
"108","1941. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",108
"109","—Do they continue to fish with lines or do they now use nets?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",109
"110","—Of course, they did not fish any this year. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",110
"111","1942. They did not try it?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",111
"112","—They could not get bait. They could not get herring. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",112
"113","1943. They don't fish for cod with trammel nets?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",113
"114","—They require to get herring for bait. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",114
"115","1944. They only fish with long lines ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",115
"116","—Yes ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",116
"117","1945. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",117
"118","—You are a native of this place?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",118
"119","—Yes. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",119
"120","1946. And you have been here all your days—off and on?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",120
"121","—Yes, but I have been some years in the south country.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",121
"122","1947. And you state to us that the circumstances of the people are falling off, and getting worse and worse?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",122
"123","—Yes, that I do. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",123
"124","1948. Has the removal of the people, which we have heard of—some of them shifted twice and three times, and shifted to places not so suitable as they allege, from good places and warmer places—a good deal to do with their poverty?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",124
"125","—A good deal to do with it. This shaking of the people is next door to evictions; shaking the people, and losing at every move. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",125
"126","1949. Particularly if they have to move to worse places?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",126
"127","—They are generally moved to worse places. I never heard of a removal to a better place, nor had I one myself, and I had several removals. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",127
"128","1950. What is the extent of this farm that we hear about connected with the inn here ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",128
"129","—I cannot give a concise account in acres, but I know it has been inhabited by a good many people. He has two farms. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",129
"130","1951. How many persons in your recollection have been upon those two farms at one time ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",130
"131","—Well, there were sixteen lots on the farm of the Beinsoraig, and a croft for the mill and a croft for the inn ; but, at the time of removing them in 1877, there were only five or six families, and there were not many people in some of them. One went to Glen Henisdale, one to Idrigil, and one is on the ground. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",131
"132","1952. Then the other farm, what is the name of that?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",132
"133","—Glen Conan or Glen Uig. Glen Conan is the new name. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",133
"134","1953. How many people were on that farm?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",134
"135","—I cannot exactly say, but I believe in connection with the farm there were more than forty-three families removed. The first removal was when Captain Fraser came to the place. Then, when the hill pasture was added, the rest were removed, and brought to another place opposite. Of course, Glen Uig has a southern exposure, and the other is exposed to the blasts of the north wind. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",135
"136","1954. Is there anything of that kind going on at this moment? When was the latest removal of any consequence ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",136
"137","—I do not recollect of any since 1877. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",137
"138","1955. It is stopped now?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",138
"139","—Well, I think it should. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",139
"140","1956. And, so far as you know, it has ceased ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",140
"141","—It has, so far as I know. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",141
"142","1957. You say the people, and you yourself, have worked at railway construction? You have heard there is a project for a new railway from Inverness to Glasgow ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",142
"143","—I know that. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",143
"144","1958. If that went on, would a number of people from about this place go to it ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",144
"145","—I have no doubt a great many would avail themselves of the opportunity. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",145
"146","1959. And it would be a convenient distance for the people to go?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",146
"147","— Yes, it would. They would avail themselves of it. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",147
"148","1960. You stated you had been removed more than once?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",148
"149","—Yes. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",149
"150","1961. Tell us about your removals—you held land at one time?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",150
"151","—Yes.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",151
"152","1962. Where was your first croft?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",152
"153","—On No. 13, Beinsoraig. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",153
"154","1963. How long were you there?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",154
"155","—I was there from 1856 to 1869 or 1870. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",155
"156","1964. Where were you moved to?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",156
"157","—To No. 89 of the same place. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",157
"158","1965. Not by your own wish?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",158
"159","—No. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",159
"160","1966. How long were you on the second lot?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",160
"161","—Seven years. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",161
"162","1967. What happened to you after that?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",162
"163","—After having put up two or three houses and two stack-yards, corn-yards, and several other improvements, I lost the croft. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",163
"164","1968. What compensation did you get?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",164
"165","—When I was removed from No. 89 I was ordered to go to South Cuil, aud I believed, as the croft lies, it would have been 4½ and 5 chains ; but, as I would have to treat it, it would have been 8 or 9,- and, after having taken the lot, after my name was put on the lot, when I got my cattle and sheep sold, I did not go to the lot at all. A house at a distance of 8 or 9 chains, more or less, would not do at all, with the house in one place, and the cattle and the byre in another. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",165
"166","1969. Did you get any compensation for your involuntary removals?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",166
"167","— In name of my barn I got £7, and at my first removal I got £2; but the barn, byre, and stable cost me £18. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",167
"168","1970. You got, then, half of what they cost?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",168
"169","—Yes. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",169
"170","1971. Professor Mackinnon.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",170
"171","—You began to trade in 1857, and you had a croft all along to 1877 ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",171
"172","—Yes.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",172
"173","1972. Have you been trading and crofting during the whole of that time ? ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",173
"174","—Yes.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",174
"175","1973. You don't trade now so much as you did before?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",175
"176","—Well, I lost a good many of my customers at the time of these removals. When the house was pulled down people thought I would never rise again, and my customers scattered, and I am some distance from the road. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",176
"177","1974. And from the knowledge you got by trading, do you believe that the circumstances of the people have been getting worse and worse ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",177
"178","— Yes, I believe that. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",178
"179","1975. And you say that the cause of that is what?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",179
"180","—Bad seasons, heavy rents, want of public works, and failure of fishings at home and abroad. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",180
"181","1976. And how do you propose that the circumstances of the people might be improved? You cannot change the seasons, and you cannot change the fishings at home or abroad 1",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",181
"182","—No, but when people are down you will have to do more than put them on their feet. You will have to keep them up till they can do something for themselves. If people got Government money, which other parts of the United Kingdom are getting in plenty—if they got a little at 5 per cent, and twenty years to pay it—I have no doubt but that they would pay it honestly, and that it would be laid out at good interest, aud as sure as any speculation.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",182
"183","1977. Where is this matter of Government loans going on?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",183
"184","—In Ireland. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",184
"185","1978. And how do you propose the people should use the money? What use is the money to be put to ?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",185
"186","—To put the people into a better position. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",186
"187","1979. In what way?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",187
"188","—To enable them to get as much of the land as will keep them, and then give them this money to stock and till it, and build houses for themselves and their belongings. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",188
"189","1980. Is there plenty of land in this parish for them to get?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",189
"190","—Plenty, as much as would keep three times the number of its present inhabitants. ",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",190
"191","1981. On this same estate?",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",191
"192","—Yes; the land is nearly all taken up in three or four farms—there is that farm which Urquhart has now.",31,"Angus Mcinnes","Skye, Uig",192
