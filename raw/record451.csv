"1","Rev. DUNCAN FINLAYSON, Free Church Minister, Kinlochbervie, Parish of Eddriachillis —examined.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",1
"2","26698. The Chairman.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",2
"3","—How long have you been settled in this parish? ",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",3
"4","—Two years only. ",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",4
"5","26699. From what part of the country do you come?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",5
"6","—Inverness-shire ; I was born there.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",6
"7","26700. Had you a charge there?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",7
"8","—No, this is my first charge.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",8
"9","26701. Have you a statement you wish to make in regard to the condition of your people generally?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",9
"10","—No, but I want to make a few remarks about secondary education. We are at a disadvantage about",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",10
"11","that; boys that are getting up after thirteen, cannot be educated here. The teacher is willing to educate them if there was room to teach them, but the schoolroom seems to be too small. The boys last year wished to go for education during winter, and the teacher could not take them; he has enough to do to teach the children under thirteen.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",11
"12","26702. Sheriff Nicolson.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",12
"13","—Will you explain exactly why he cannot teach them?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",13
"14","—I heard it stated that the rooms are too small. Down here at Insheigra there are a great many past age, but there is no room in the school for them.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",14
"15","26703. There is no room for them to sit in the school and be taught?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",15
"16","—I was told so.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",16
"17","26704. How many scholars does the school house accommodate?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",17
"18","—There are sixty-six scholars within school age in the district.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",18
"19","26705. And is the attendance generally large?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",19
"20","—Yes, I think it is pretty large. I don't know as to the regularity of the attendance; I am not a member of the School Board, and have not been often in the school.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",20
"21","26706. But is the attendance so large that there is not room enough to teach any except those who come in for elementary education?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",21
"22","—Yes, I was told so by the boys. They went to the other school in this end of the parish and the teacher there has more room; but the parents in that end objected to children from this end of the parish going to be educated there, and sent in a petition to the teacher, so that he had to dismiss them",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",22
"23","and not allow them into his school.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",23
"24","26707. What can these boys do in the way of prosecuting their education?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",24
"25","—They must be self-taught, I suppose. We have a very clever boy here at present. He was the first in the examination of the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge. He used to attend school until now that he is over school age.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",25
"26","26708. And he cannot get the benefit of the schoolmaster's instruction except at the school?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",26
"27","—He is past the age now. I am not aware if the teacher would take him in after this, and be is too delicate, his father considers, to send him from home. I don't know what he is to do in winter.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",27
"28","26709. Is the schoolmaster quite fit to carry on the education of this boy?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",28
"29","—I think so, but I am not quite sure.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",29
"30","26710. So that, practically, secondary education is impossible in the school in this place?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",30
"31","—Yes, I think that is the fact.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",31
"32","26711. You spoke about the school in this place?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",32
"33","—There are two Board Schools in this district—one at Insheigra and the other at Old Shore.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",33
"34","26712. Which did you refer to?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",34
"35","—I don't hear any complaints of one of them being too small, but I have heard it repeatedly said that it is the smallness of the schoolroom at Insheigra that is the difficulty. It is quite crowded with children within school age.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",35
"36","26713. Wa3 it considered by the inhabitants from the beginning to be",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",36
"37","too small?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",37
"38","—I am not aware. I was not here at the time it was built.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",38
"39","26714. Is there anything else you are aware of that the people have reason to complain of?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",39
"40","—No, except the doctor. We would join to get a doctor. That is a general complaint, although we are not so far from him as the Durness people. The doctor is about nineteen miles from us. Another grievance is that we have not a smith in this place, and have to send for him seventeen miles to Scourie. I have heard it said that no smith could be had without a croft.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",40
"41","26715. Is there any reason why there should not be a smith?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",41
"42","—I heard it stated that no one could be got —that he could not support himself with what he could earn at his trade without a croft.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",42
"43","26716. So the people have to go all the way to Scourie to get iron work done?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",43
"44","—Yes, seventeen miles. As to the means of communication, if we could get the railway which the former delegate spoke of, it would be of the greatest benefit to this district; and also a telegraph line.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",44
"45","26717. How far are you from the nearest telegraph station?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",45
"46","—Lairg, forty-six miles. I think the telegraph would benefit the fishing class. The telegraph and the railway would be the making of the place. The means of communication here are very bad. We have to get all our goods from Thurso by smack. The vessel goes round by Cape Wrath, and is often a long time by the way. Last winter the people sometimes ran out of meal, and had to use the seed they were keeping and turn it into meal.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",46
"47","26718. Is there no shop at all in this neighbourhood?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",47
"48","—A good many small ones, but there is not a general one which keeps a large stock of everything.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",48
"49","26719. Is there none that deals in meal ?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",49
"50","—Three of them deal in meal. ",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",50
"51","26720. But I suppose most of the people prefer to get their goods from Thurso?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",51
"52","—Yes, by the smack, and from Wick too. It would be a great benefit to have the steamer which goes in to Badcall three miles from Scourie. ",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",52
"53","26721. The Chairman.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",53
"54","—You stated you had the same complaint as the people of Durness, that you are very far from the doctor. How many miles are you from him?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",54
"55","—Nineteen.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",55
"56","26722. And how far are the Durness people",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",56
"57","—Thirty miles.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",57
"58","26723. Do you happen to have had any cases of emergency, such as accidents, here, when there was great inconvenience felt from the want of a doctor ?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",58
"59","—Not since I came here, but I suppose there have been. He is very often needed down here. The doctor himself is not well this season ; he was nearly dead with going about so much.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",59
"60","26724. How far does his circuit extend on the other side ?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",60
"61","—To Kyle Sku, I believe. He has not many people on the other side.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",61
"62","26725. In cases of child-birth has the want of the doctor been felt?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",62
"63","—Yes, I believe it has.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",63
"64","26726. Is there any educated women in the neighbourhood who can attend to such cases?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",64
"65","—I believe not.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",65
"66","26727. You stated that want of accommodation for higher education is felt in the school at Insheigra?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",66
"67","—Yes.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",67
"68","26728. How far is that from here?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",68
"69","—Close on two miles.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",69
"70","26729. There is a school here?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",70
"71","—Yes.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",71
"72","26730. And there the same want is not felt?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",72
"73","—No; I think not.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",73
"74","26731. Is there the same demand for secondary education in the school here that there is at Insheigra?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",74
"75","—I should think so. There are a great many boys above school age.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",75
"76","26732. Do boys above school age avail themselves of teaching in the higher subjects there?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",76
"77","—Some of them did; I am not aware if they do now. Some boys would like to attend school in winter.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",77
"78","26733. When was the school at Insheigra built?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",78
"79","—It has been built since the new Act came into force.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",79
"80","26734. Have the people of Insheigra petitioned the School Board for increased school accommodation?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",80
"81","—I am not aware that they have. I have not heard that they did.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",81
"82","26735. Have you made a representation yourself to the School Board?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",82
"83","—No.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",83
"84","26736. Who was the chairman of the School Board here?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",84
"85","—Mr M'lver.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",85
"86","26737. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",86
"87","—Kinlochbervie is part of the civil parish of Eddrachillis : how many schools are under the School Board?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",87
"88","—Three.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",88
"89","26738. Two in this part and one at Scourie?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",89
"90","—One at Scourie.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",90
"91","26739. Have the School Board appointed any managers for these schools?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",91
"92","—I am not aware that they have. Is it the compulsory officer you mean.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",92
"93","26740. It is in the power of the School Board to appoint some of their number, or a gentleman from the outside in the neighbourhood, manager of a special school; and I thought they might have appointed you such a manager in this district?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",93
"94","—No; I was not appointed. Perhaps they have appointed the other minister, Mr Lundie, who is a member of the board.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",94
"95","26741. Has any representation been made to the board about the amount of accommodation?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",95
"96","—I am not a member of the board.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",96
"97","26742. But has any representation been made by the inhabitants of the district?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",97
"98","—I am not aware, but the parents have been often complaining to me about the want of secondary education.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",98
"99","26743. What have you done in consequence of their complaints to you?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",99
"100","—I did not do anything.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",100
"101","26744. You did not represent it to Mr M’Iver?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",101
"102","—Perhaps they have done it themselves before my coming here. I am not long here.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",102
"103","26745. Professor MacKinnon.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",103
"104","—Have you considered what effect it would have upon the rate? What is the school rate of the parish?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",104
"105","—Ninepence—fourpence halfpenny on tenants and fourpence halfpenny on landlords.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",105
"106","26746. I think you stated that one of the reasons for the defective secondary education was that the master could not give his time to the higher boys during school hours—that he has sufficient to do otherwise. What is the greatest difficulty—want of room or want of teaching power ?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",106
"107","—The teacher stated to me that he would have difficulty even if he had room.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",107
"108","26747. So that you want not merely a bigger school but a bigger staff of teachers?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",108
"109","—I suppose so.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",109
"110","26748. Would you ask that in all the schools? ",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",110
"111","—I don't know as to the other schools. I suppose Scourie school is very well taught. I think",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",111
"112","there is plenty of room there; but I don't know.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",112
"113","26749. Do you think it would be reasonable to expect that a highly equipped school for secondary education should be placed in every locality whatever the number of people?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",113
"114","—I think there should be some way of getting secondary education. That would be desirable; there is",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",114
"115","no doubt of that. We are so far away from any town here, to send them to, that the parents cannot afford to send their children should they be willing; and there is no one rising up. The people say that clever boys got on far better under the old system. Several boys from here became teachers and some of them preachers during the old time.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",115
"116","26750. Were the school houses bigger then?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",116
"117","—In the parish lay schools, and now there is no one rising above the common level.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",117
"118","26751. I am glad to know there are notable exceptions just now?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",118
"119","—I am speaking generally.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",119
"120","26752. You know various parts of the country very well along the western sea-board down to Mull and these places?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",120
"121","—Yes.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",121
"122","26753. Comparing that district with this do you consider that the condition of the people here or there is, take it all round, better or worse—take the south end of Mull?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",122
"123","—I should say they are better off here than in the south end of Mull—Ross of Mull.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",123
"124","26754. Better housed?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",124
"125","—No. The houses are inferior here, some of them.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",125
"126","26755. But, take it all in all they are better off here ?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",126
"127","—Yes. I should say so; they have more pasture.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",127
"128","26756. And as to the rents?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",128
"129","—I don't know as to the rents.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",129
"130","26757. Don't you know the rents in the south end of Mull?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",130
"131","—No, but there are some of the people very poor there.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",131
"132","26758. Is there any other district in the West Highlands which you know the rents of?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",132
"133","—No.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",133
"134","26759. Do you agree generally with the description the people give of their own condition here?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",134
"135","—Yes, I agree with what our own delegates stated, and I agree also with the statements of the Durness people generally as to the medical officer and so on.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",135
"136","26760. The remedy they themselves suggested in all cases was to get more land; do you also concur in that?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",136
"137","—Yes, I do, because it is impossible for them to winter their cattle; that is the great complaint. More arable land is what is needed; and I think their pasture land might be improved if it were drained. ",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",137
"138","26761. Supposiug they got more land they say themselves they are not able to stock it. Do you think some benevolent friends outside could help them in any way? Have they relatives abroad with means?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",138
"139","—Very few of them have, I think, but I think the houses should be improved, and that would increase the comfort of the people in every way. The cattle go in by the same door in some of the houses; and in some instances there are two families in one house, which is very undesirable.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",139
"140","26762. The Chairman.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",140
"141","—Have you yourself seen houses in which two families were living in one room?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",141
"142","—No, not in one room; I think they generally have two at least.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",142
"143","26763. But you have seen houses of two rooms in which there was a family in each room?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",143
"144","—In some houses there are the family of the father and of an elder married son. That seems to have been allowed by the laws of the estate.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",144
"145","26764. Living in two rooms?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",145
"146","—I think they live in family.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",146
"147","26765. But one family sleeps in one room and the other family in the other?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",147
"148","—-I think they live just like one family and have sleeping apartments. Some of them have a closet and two rooms.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",148
"149","26766. You stated that in some of the houses the people enter by the same door as the cattle, that is the house enters by the byre, the byre being separate?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",149
"150","—Yes, in some cases.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",150
"151","26767. Do you know any instance of a house without a slight partition between the byre and the dwelling-room?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",151
"152","—Yes, I know one in this very place, a pauper, and she lives in a house where there is no partition between her and the cow.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",152
"153","26768. Does the pauper keep a cow?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",153
"154","—Yes; her daughter is with her. It is her daughter who has the cow. The old woman is the pauper.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",154
"155","26769. Do you think that in some cases the lodging is so bad and dirty as to be prejudicial to health?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",155
"156","—I should think so at any rate; but I don't hear complaints. I would not like to live in such a place.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",156
"157","26770. Are you aware of any case in which a very bad house has been visited by the health officer, and denounced as a nuisance or dangerous to health?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",157
"158","—I am not aware that such is the case; I never heard of our having such an official as a health officer.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",158
"159","26771. Some of the houses are very inferior, but you have no inspector of nuisances or sanitary inspector?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",159
"160","—I never heard of his going round ; but there may be such an officer. The inspector of poor, Mr M'lver informs me, is sanitary officer.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",160
"161","26772. Who is he?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",161
"162","—Mr Chisholm, Scourie.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",162
"163","26773. How far off does he live?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",163
"164","—He lives at Scourie, seventeen miles from here.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",164
"165","26774. Does he often come here?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",165
"166","—He comes, I think, occasionally.  I don't know him very well, yet.",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",166
"167","26775. Did you ever hear of him inspecting the habitations of the poor, with respect to their sanitary condition?",451,"Rev Duncan Finlayson","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",167
