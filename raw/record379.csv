"43","22026. Do I understand from you that other people have better places than yours?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",43

"54","—I could not do that.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",54
"55","22032. Is that as much as the 4½ acres you have now?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",55
"56","—It was more, but we were on a different system then; we were going to the fishing and getting a very little for the fish, and had a very low rent. Then when the land was planted we got an over-rent to pay.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",56
"57","22033. Were you fishing for the landlord in those times?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",57

"62","—Yes, if there was any over; but there never was very much over.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",62
"63","22036. In some places we were told that in those old times the people were better off; but in your opinion it was not so?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",63
"64","—I cannot say they were so;—but if they are better now it is owing to the people getting their eyes enlightened.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",64
"65","22037. I daresay they require a little more light still?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",65
"66","—I think so.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",66
"67","22038. For whom do you fish now?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",67

"77","22043. Do the boat's crew get half the produce?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",77
"78","—I suppose if Hay and Co. own the boat they get half-catch; but generally the men own the boat themselves.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",78
"79","22044. Do you own your boat?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",79
"80","—I am too old a man to go; I don't go in the boats.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",80

"86","—One of them lives with me, but I am obliged to him or I could not live.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",86
"87","22048. Is your grievance that you are paying too heavy rent?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",87
"88","—Yes, the full rent, and the seathold taken off from us.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",88
"89","22049. Tell us about the scathold?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",89
"90","—It was taken off for the sheep farm on the island, half of the island is taken off for that, and so",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",90
"91","100 families left on the other half of the island, which is four miles long and two broad.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",91
"92","22050. And the 100 families have got half of it?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",92
"93","—No, half the scathold is taken off from them.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",93
"94","22051. Half of the scathold goes to these 100 families, and the other half to one man?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",94
"95","—Yes.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",95

"99","—From his father, the minister of Bressay.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",99
"100","22054. Does he live on the island?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",100
"101","—Yes. That is our grievance I have to complain of; and I have no place to tether a cow in, and cannot",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",101
"102","have a drop of milk.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",102
"103","22055. Is that the state of matters among your neighbours?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",103
"104","—Very near; not one in the town has more than one cow, and there are twelve neighbours in the town.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",104
"105","22056. Ts there a scarcity of milk for children in consequence?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",105
"106","—Yes.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",106
"107","22057. How long is it since Mr Hamilton got the farm?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",107
"108","—I could not exactly say.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",108
"109","22058. You said that in 1863 the island was planted?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",109
"110","—Yes, but he had not got it then.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",110
"111","22059. When was it made into a sheep farm?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",111

"114","—No, Mr Shepherd was the first there as a sheep farmer.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",114
"115","22061. How long was he there?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",115
"116","—I think about seven years.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",116
"117","22062. Did he do well on it?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",117
"118","—Yes, he went south and took a far larger farm. Mr Hamilton, I reckon, is making as good a thing of it.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",118
"119","22063. And by your account the crofters are making nothing of it?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",119
"120","—No, I am living on a small bare bit of land now for twenty years 4½  acres of land for £6 , 16s. of rent.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",120
"121","22064. Was there any other old cultivated land taken off and given to this sheep farm?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",121
"122","—Three holdings.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",122
"123","22065. How many acres might be in these holdings; I suppose about fifteen altogether?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",123
"124","—About that.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",124
"125","22066. And does that gentleman cultivate these lands?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",125
"126","—No, he keeps them lying for grazing sheep.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",126
"127","22067. It is all out of cropping?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",127
"128","—Yes.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",128
"129","22068. What induced the proprietor to make this change in the island?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",129
"130","—The proprietor himself was badly when this took place, and shortly after he died. He was not fit to manage the place himself, and so he let it out to these gentlemen",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",130
"131","22069. Have you any idea what rent Mr Hamilton pays?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",131
"132","—I heard, when Shepherd got it, that he was to pay £170, but that might be true or it might not.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",132
"133","22070. Then he is not paying nearly so much as yourself and the other small tenants?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",133
"134","—Nothing like it.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",134
"135","22071. And it does not seem to be for the benefit of the proprietor that he should be there at all?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",135
"136","—I don't think it.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",136
"137","22072. And it is certainly not for the benefit of the small people?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",137
"138","—No, it is greatly to our disadvantage; for his sheep are on the heather of the hill, and our sheep would eat it while his won't. His sheep never taste it.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",138
"139","22073. It comes to this, that the pastures must therefore be falling back if they are not properly eaten?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",139
"140","—I believe it is getting no good. ",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",140
"141","22074. Why didn't the people in the island meet in the way they have done in other places and send delegates to come here?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",141
"142","—They met and sent delegates.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",142
"143","22075. I think you stated you were not one of them?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",143
"144","—I am not one, I only wanted to come here to get a hearing if possible, there are delegates here besides me.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",144
"145","22076. Is John Stewart a delegate?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",145
"146","—No, but he wants a hearing.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",146
"147","22077. Is James Shearer a delegate?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",147
"148","—No.",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",148
"149","22078. Is Alexander Jamieson a delegate?",379,"William Hutcheson","Shetland, Lerwick",149
