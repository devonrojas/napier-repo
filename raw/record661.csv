"1","JOHN SUTHERLAND, Feuar and Tenant, Rosehall (52)— examined.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",1
"2","39750. The Chairman.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",2
"3","—In what year was the property sold by the Matheson family to Mr Mackay ?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",3
"4","—In 1870. ",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",4
"5","39751. To whom was it sold by Mr Mackay?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",5
"6","—To Mr Robert Tennant of Leeds.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",6
"7","39752. Was it not sold first to a company?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",7
"8","—No; but Mr George Grant Mackay had Messrs Rule and Stewart as his partners when he bought the estate first, and he paid them off, and kept the estate for himself.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",8
"9","39753. Then Mr Mackay bought the estate in partnership with other persons?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",9
"10","—Yes, in 1870.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",10
"11","39754. But then he bought in for himself separately?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",11
"12","—Yes.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",12
"13","39755. And ho has sold another portion of it?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",13
"14","—Yes. He has sold Glen Cassley, but he sold that before he got Rosehall as his own portion.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",14
"15","39756. But the two properties were first of all sold by the Mathesons altogether ?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",15
"16","—There are three properties—Glen Cassley, Glen Rossal, and Rosehall. They were sold altogether in 1870.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",16
"17","39757. How much was the price of the three?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",17
"18","—£50,000.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",18
"19","39758. Then Mr Mackay became proprietor of one of these ?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",19
"20","—Yes.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",20
"21","39759. And he sold that one to Mr Tennant; how much did he get for the one ?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",21
"22","—I am not certain of the amount, I believe it was close on £50,000; but for the whole estate they got £100,000.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",22
"23","39760. They bought the three properties for £50,000, and got £100,000 for them ?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",23
"24","—Yes.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",24
"25","39761. Were they supposed to have laid out much money on improvements?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",25
"26","—Very little. There were temporary roads made, and some of the hill pasture that was to be feued was ploughed by oxen so as to encourage feuars to feu the ground.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",26
"27","39762. Since Mr Tennant bought Rosehall, what has he done with the property ?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",27
"28","—There were a few that were unable to keep their feus, and the land fell back into Mr Tennant's hands, and he gave them leases.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",28
"29","39763. Will you describe what Mr Mackay and his partners did with the property first of all?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",29
"30","—First of all, after buying the property, they sold all the wood that was on the estate. There were four steam sawmills put up to cut down the wood, and the whole of the wood on the estate almost was cut down. Then Glen Cassley was sold to Mr Gordon M'Leod from Skye, and Glen Rossal was sold to Mr Stewart, who had been a partner in the purchase of the property, and afterwards Mr Mackay became the proprietor of the Rosehall estate. After the whole was feued the hill pasture was taken off the tenants.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",30
"31","39764. How did they set about feuing ? Describe the process by which they divided these feus. First of all, in whose hands was the ground which was laid off in feus; was it in the hands of the small",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",31
"32","tenants? ",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",32
"33","—There were about 1200 acres of hill ground in the hands of the crofters. This 1200 acres was advertised in the papers to be feued, and people from a distance that did not know the land came forward and feued the ground at an average of about 5s. an acre. These feuars took possession of the ground, and some of them have been making improvements upon it. Some of them have wasted their means upon these grounds, and after wasting their own means they applied to loan companies to lend money on the securities of their holdings.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",33
"34","39765. In the meantime, what became of the small tenants ?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",34
"35","—There were a few acres of the pasture that was held formerly attached to their arable ground and given out as feus. This pasture they were charged 6s. an acre for, and they were charged £ 1 an acre for their arable ground.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",35
"36","39766. But the arable land, now in the posession of the small tenants, was not offered to be feued?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",36
"37","—Most of them got the option of taking it themselves first, and if they did not take it then it was offered to any man who would take it.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",37
"38","39767. Arable as well as pasture ?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",38
"39","—Yes, the whole of their holdings.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",39
"40","39768. Did many of the small tenants take feus?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",40
"41","—At first they all refused, but Mr Mackay told them he would carry out his wish, and if they did not take it he would give ground and houses to other people. Therefore, about ten days before Whitsunday 1870, most of them came to give it a trial. There were about thirty crofters on the township of Altas at the time the estate was sold, and of these there were twelve who did not accept of the terms. There were six of these who did not get the chance of taking them. These were women, and the old men who could not do any good to the land, and these meu did not get the chance of taking it on any terms. They were deprived of the whole of their labour and their dwelling-houses, and without a halfpenny of compensation. There were other six also that would not take it, and they left without getting any compensation for what they had done. ",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",41
"42","39769. What was the length of the feus?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",42
"43","—Perpetual. ",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",43
"44","39770. How were the ground rents of the feuars compared with the rent on the arable ground paid by the small tenants before?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",44
"45","—After taking about 1200 acres of hill ground off them, and about 200 or 300 acres of lowland pasture off them, for what was left to them they were charged double what their former rent was with this pasturage.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",45
"46","39771. Had they to pay down a sum of money for the feu besides?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",46
"47","—No, they paid an annual feu-duty.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",47
"48","39772. There was no fine?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",48
"49","—No.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",49
"50","39773. £1 per acre for the arable land?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",50
"51","—Yes",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",51
"52","39774. And the former rent was 10s. ?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",52
"53","—Yes, and 6s. for the waste ground, which no sheep farmer in the county would think worth 6d. an acre.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",53
"54","39775. So they got positive property in the land for a feu-duty of £1 per acre and 6s. for pasture. Was the pasture at 6s. an acre susceptible of improvement? Was it generally land that could be trenched and taken in, or was it quite hopeless ground ?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",54
"55","—Some of it was hopeless, but there were other parts that would improve, and could be made arable with great expense, after about £20 an acre was put out on them.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",55
"56","39776. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",56
"57","—All the matters you referred to created a good deal of talk and excitement at the time?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",57
"58","—A great deal.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",58
"59","39777. There was a considerable demand, prices were high, and a considerable demand for land and farms?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",59
"60","—Yes, by strangers who came to see it, but none of those parties who knew the land ever offered for it.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",60
"61","39778. I suppose, though you and others are making a complaint against the amount of feu-duty that was put upon you, you are not against the principle of feuing lots?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",61
"62","—No/the principle is good, but it is overdone by the feu-duties being, in some cases, three times what the value of the land is.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",62
"63","39779. I think, in a paper which was read by the previous delegate, he states that a full year's rent would be paid upon a death. Surely that is a mistake? Was it not a double feu?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",63
"64","—The double of the feu-duty, that is a year's rent.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",64
"65","39780. With regard to the six aged women and others, what became of those who didn't get the opportunity of offering for land?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",65
"66","—Some of them were put on the parochial roll and supported by the parish.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",66
"67","39781. Was no allowance made of any kind?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",67
"68","—No.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",68
"69","39782. And no contribution made by the proprietor?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",69
"70","—No.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",70
"71","39783. And no houses supplied, for them?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",71
"72","—Nothing of the kind. Along with the thirty crofters there were 100 cottars and paupers upon the estate, and they were ejected, and their holdings were given to others along with the crofters.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",72
"73","39784. Then how many heads of families were deprived of their houses by these operations?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",73
"74","—I stated there were six who did not get an opportunity, and six who got the opportunity and did not accept of it.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",74
"75","39785. I am referring now to the cottars you are speaking of?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",75
"76","—Probably there might be about eight cottars; I am not certain of the number.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",76
"77","39786. And no provision was made for them ?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",77
"78","—No provision whatever.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",78
"79","39787. And what became of them?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",79
"80","—The parties who feued the ground allowed some of them to remain in their holdings.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",80
"81","39788. What is the positiou of such of the feuars as have still been enabled to carry on ; are they complaining very much?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",81
"82","—The condition is this, with regard to some of the feuars, that when their means were done they applied to loan companies for money to carry on, and money has been advanced to them by loan companies upon the faith of their holdings and the result was that they were not able to pay according to the terms of agreement, and they were sequestrated, and vacancies occurred in Rosehall, with liabilities amounting to over £10,000 in the last seven years. In some cases the trustees were not able to realise what would make a halfpenny of a dividend after the expenses and preferable claims were paid. In other cases it was only a few pounds; so it is not only the feuars who have suffered, but a great many of the public as well.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",82
"83","39789. Other people have suffered from the insolvencies?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",83
"84","—Yes, even our good Caledonian Bank has lost £2000 or £3000.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",84
"85","39790. Are any people complaining from the estate of Culrain, on the opposite side, the same as you are at Rosehall?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",85
"86","—I am not very well acquainted with them, but they have been complaining.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",86
"87","39791. Have you been well acquainted with this district for many years ?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",87
"88","—I have lived in Rosehall for the last twenty-four years.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",88
"89","39792. Do you carry on any other business?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",89
"90","—I sometimes carry on shoemaking.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",90
"91","39793. And you have means of knowing the real state of the people?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",91
"92","—Yes, I know everything about them for the last twenty-four years by what I saw, and for more than twenty years before that from old men.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",92
"93","39794. Do you think, upon the whole, it would have been better for the crofters and small tenants had this experiment never been tried, and that the property should have remained in the Mathesons' possession?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",93
"94","—I am certain of that.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",94
"95","39795. Will you still say that when I tell you that yesterday we had—also from the property of the Matheson's —very great complaints from the Gruids, though matters remain apparently as they were forty years ago?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",95
"96","—And so we do, because our holdings were sold by Sir James to Mr Mackay, and the improvements made he says he bought for a sum of money, and they were all summonsed at the instance of Sir James.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",96
"97","39796. Supposing the amount of feu-duty were in any way modified or reduced, would the place be prosperous?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",97
"98","—Yes, I believe it would.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",98
"99","39797. Can you say from your own observation that additional land has been taken in, or that old land that was formerly taken in has been meliorated or improved by the feuars since they became feuars?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",99
"100","—There has been both.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",100
"101","39798. In fact, they have done their best to make the best of it?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",101
"102","—Yes, and gone past what was ordinarily done. There is one instance I can give of how the feus were over-feued. There is one place of 120 acres that was feued in 1870 at £30. Between 1870 and 1875 there were three feuars upon that place in succession one after another. Their loss was about £400 between them. In 1875 the feu came into the hands of Mr Tennant, and, after an outlay of £230, he was not able to let it at anything up till Whitsunday 1877. In 1877 there was a man who took a fifteen years' lease of it at an annual rent of £25.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",102
"103","39799. You give that as an illustration of over-renting?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",103
"104","—Yes. Then in the March following he made a moonlight flitting, and left Mr Tennant without paying a halfpenny of rent, and the place was in Mr Tennant's hands up till 1880. In 1880 he let it to another man for £12. That man kept it till Whitsunday 1881, and left without paying a halfpenny of the £12. In 1881 a neighbouring crofter gave an offer of £10, providing there woidd be a certain portion of it fenced, which would cost, I suppose about £50. This offer was accepted, and there has been £10 paid for it since Whitsunday 1881. Mr Tennant bought the feus upon twenty-two years' purchase, so this feu cost him at first £660, and he has laid out £280 along with that, and all the estate took in from 1875 up till now has been £ 20; only they have the shooting. ",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",104
"105","39800. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",105
"106","—Do you say those three first feuars had expended a large sum of money upon it?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",106
"107","—The first man expended somewhere about £90, and he left it after paying a year's feu-duty, and ",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",107
"108","putting down a crop without getting anything for it, only Mr Mackay gave him a valuation for the crop. Then it was feued to a man from Orkney. He came forward and built houses upon it and a waterpower threshing-mill. He got disgusted, and the feus were not supposed to be so bad as they were, and he tried to get it sold, and he got a man from Aberdeen to come forward and give £310 for it. He was there for about two years, and he saw he was ' done,' and tried to sell it. He went to Mr Tennant and told him what he had done, and Mr Tennant gave him £200 for it, and he thought he would get it let at a high rent, but he never got anything for it till late in 1881. Mr Tennant then laid out about £30 in improving the houses and doing other improvements.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",108
"109","39801. I thought you said Mr Tennant gave £600?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",109
"110","—Yes, for purchasing the property from Mr Mackay. He gave twenty-two years' purchase.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",110
"111","39802. How many of these feus are there?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",111
"112","—About thirty-three.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",112
"113","39803. What is the average extent of them?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",113
"114","—There is one feu that is, I suppose, over 1000 acres, feued by Professor Geddes, Aberdeen.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",114
"115","39804. What is the smallest?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",115
"116","—About fourteen acres.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",116
"117","39805. They run from fourteen to 1000 acres?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",117
"118","—Yes.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",118
"119","39806. What will most of them be?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",119
"120","—Well, as to the old crofters who took feus, their average will be from twelve to seventeen acres.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",120
"121","39807. There have been other vacancies besides the one you mentioned?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",121
"122","—Yes, several cases.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",122
"123","39808. Have their feus been sold?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",123
"124","—They have been tried to be sold, but a halfpenny could not be got for them. There was a gentleman",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",124
"125","from Glasgow who expended £1000 on his feu. He was paying £65 of feu-duty, and he expended £1000, and he became bankrupt before he died, and the trustees were unable to get a halfpenny for it.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",125
"126","39809. Have these feus been sold in any circumstances whatever?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",126
"127","—Yes, they have.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",127
"128","39810. At a profit?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",128
"129","—No, I don't think they were sold for a profit, after the outlay.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",129
"130","39811. But some of them have been saleable; they have not been all so bad?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",130
"131","—No, some of them have been sold.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",131
"132","39812. The Chairman.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",132
"133","—With regard to the small feuars who were formerly crofters—that class who have kept their former arable land as feus—have they done pretty well, or been ruined too?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",133
"134","—Well, they are trying to clear their way pretty well; some of them got help from Australia and friends elsewhere.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",134
"135","39813. In the case of the small tenants who remained as feuars, about what area of arable land do they generally hold—five or six acres?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",135
"136","—Their average will be about seven. There are some as low as five and six, and some as high as nine and ten.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",136
"137","39814. Do you think they have made greater improvements on the land which they hold as feus at a higher rent than they would have done if they had continued to hold the land as crofters ?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",137
"138","—No, they have not; they made more improvements when they were tenants at will, than they have done since they became feuars.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",138
"139","39815. They are nut able to do it now? There are some of the people who still remained as crofters?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",139
"140","—No, there are none here allowed to remain as crofters. They became crofters afterwards by giving up their feus to Mr Tennant, but every one who would not be a feuar was turned out",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",140
"141","39816. But the previous witness said his rent had been raised from £3, 10s. to £7, 10s.?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",141
"142","—Yes, but I understand that he got some more low-lying pasture added to it.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",142
"143","39817. He said he had more stock?",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",143
"144","—Yes, but the hill pasture was taken off him. His land was feued by another man, —he was only the sub-tenant of this feuar. He lost his holding from Mr Mackay, and he was a sub-tenant.",661,"John Sutherland","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",144
