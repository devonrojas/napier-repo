"1","Rev. JOHN CAMERON, Roman Catholic Priest, Dornie (41)—examined.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",1
"2","31584. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",2
"3","—How long have you been in Dornie? ",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",3
"4","—Ten years. ",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",4
"5","31585. Have you any general statement to make?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",5
"6","—Not particularly.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",6
"7","31586. Y'ou heard what Mr Morison said ?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",7
"8","—I did. With regard to the general management of the estate, I can confirm what Mr Morison said. I believe that the proprietor means well to all, but as regards the people of Bundaloch really the poverty is very great. I am living in the immediate neighbourhood of that place, and I suppose I can see how they are getting on better than any other person in the parish, and I don't know how they can manage to live at all.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",8
"9","31587. Why should the people of Bundaloch be worse off than those at Letterfearn ?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",9
"10","—They are really worse.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",10
"11","31588. What is the reason ?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",11
"12","—I believe the Letterfearn people are better fishermen than the Bundaloch people, and they are nearer to the fishing ground.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",12
"13","31589. Is Bundaloch far from Letterfearn?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",13
"14","—No, about half a mile.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",14
"15","31590. Is there difficulty in taking the boats up?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",15
"16","—There is a strong current passing Dornie, and if the current is not going with them it is very hard to work against it. I may also say that, as far as the proprietor is concerned with us Roman Catholics in the district, we have always experienced from him perfect impartiality of treatment. He gives no favours. We have no more trouble than any one else, and no one is afraid on account of his religion of being disturbed by the proprietor or the factor.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",16
"17","31591. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",17

"19","—I cannot say that I do.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",19
"20","31592. Are you aware that a number of people were crowded upon the neighbourhood?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",20
"21","—Yes, I believe they were a long time back.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",21
"22","31593. And have they been struggling ever since?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",22
"23","—Yes.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",23
"24","31594. May I ask how many people belong to your church?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",24
"25","—I suppose in Kintail and Lochalsh district nearly eighty persons.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",25
"26","31595. How many souls?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",26
"27","—Over 140; but they are so scattered that many a time I may not have forty in the church.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",27
"28","31596. Are these all old Catholics ?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",28
"29","—Old Catholics of the district. Formerly the congregation was much larger, but gradually, by emigration and other causes, they have left the district.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",29
"30","31597. Were a number of the Macraes who used to inhabit the glens not Roman Catholics ?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",30

"33","—I have no land, and I really want no land.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",33
"34","31599. There is nothing attached to your office there ?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",34
"35","—No.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",35
"36","31600. Are your people growing or rather the opposite?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",36
"37","—I cannot say they are; they are rather decreasing, and the population of the district is decreasing at the same time.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",37
"38","31601. Are there any Catholics, are you aware, further north and west, upon the west coast within Lochalsh?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",38
"39","—No, unless perhaps an Irish hawker may settle down.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",39
"40","31602. Were there ever any Roman Catholics in Glenelg?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",40
"41","—Before the Reformation, I believe there were.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",41
"42","31603. No doubt, but my question specially refers to this, that there are some in your district, and that you must jump over Glenelg to Arisaig and Morar before you come to any others ?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",42
"43","—Yes.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",43
"44","31604. Can you explain why there are none in Glenelg in recent times?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",44
"45","—I believe it depended most on the proprietors ; if the laird was Protestant the people were Protestant, and if the laird was Catholic the people Catholic.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",45
"46","31605. Have you ever heard it stated that the Macleods, who were once proprietors of Glenelg, discouraged Roman Catholics especially?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",46
"47","—I never did.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",47
"48","31606. But there are none at this moment in Glenelg, properly speaking",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",48
"49","—No, not of the natives.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",49

"52","—On Lord Lovat's estate.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",52
"53","31608. Comparing that country with this, what would you say of the condition of the people ?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",53
"54","—I believe they are far better off where I was rìght up than they are here. On Lord Lovat's estate the farms and  crofts are so divided that the crofters can get a great deal of work by labouring on the farms.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",54
"55","31609. There is a regular gradation?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",55
"56","—There is, and there are also forests in which the people are employed.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",56
"57","31610. I suppose there is more good arable land there?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",57
"58","—-Yes, it is all arable land, very little grazing.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",58
"59","31611. With regard to the education of the people hereabout, has it been improving during the last ten years ?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",59
"60","—Rapidly.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",60
"61","31612. Are the children of your communion educated in the boardschool?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",61
"62","—No, there is a school attached to our communion. ",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",62
"63","31613. But others find their way to the board schools ?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",63

"68","—No. ",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",68
"69","31616. But I suppose you are quite satisfied with the administration of the Board ?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",69
"70","—Certainly, as far as the paupers in the district are concerned. I can say there is no distinction made in the way of religion.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",70
"71","31617. In the School Board or Poor Board or anywhere else?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",71
"72","—So far as I know. I don't know about the School Board ; but we are not troubled.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",72
"73","31618. Is the school that educates your own people under inspection?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",73
"74","—Yes.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",74
"75","31619. And is regularly examined the same as the other schools in the district ?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",75

"80","—Have you anything more to state?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",80
"81","—Nothing except the poverty of Bundaloch. I was sent as a delegate for them, and if anything can be done for them it will be a great boon. They will never improve as they are, because they can't.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",81
"82","31622. You think they cannot take to fishing like their neighbours?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",82
"83","—They do fish, but they are not so successful fishermen as the Letterfearn men ; and the fishing is a very precarious occupation. In many ways they would not earn what they would earn in the same time by days' wages.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",83
"84","31623. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",84
"85","—Before you signed the petition which has been referred to were you thoroughly satisfied that the statements in it were well founded ?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",85
"86","—Well, we heard the people making these statements, and we had no reason to suppose they were not true.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",86
"87","31624. And as far as your personal knowledge goes, they were true?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",87
"88","—Many of the statements refer to events before my time.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",88
"89","31625. But with regard to the present condition?",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",89

"91","31626. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",534,"Rev John Cameron","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",91
