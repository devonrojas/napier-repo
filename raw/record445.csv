"1","DONALD MACKAY, Laid, Port-na-Con (60)—examined.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",1
"2","26405. Sheriff Nicolson.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",2
"3","—What has been your business in life?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",3
"4","—I was a fisherman in Nova Scotia, a teacher in Rogart, Sutherland, and in Argyleshire, and I have been a landed proprietor and sheep-run holder in New Zealaud. I am at present residing at Laid, Loch Erriboll.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",4
"5","26406. Have you been elected a delegate?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",5
"6","—I have. At two public meetings recently held I was unanimously elected by all the crofters of the hamlet of Laid.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",6
"7","26407. What statement have you to make on behalf of these people?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",7
"8","—Well, I have studied to the best of my ability medicine as a private person. I made myself a good deal acquainted with the order and practice of hydropathic treatment, and have got intimately  acquainted with the actual condition of the people in that way, so that I can tell the Commission the actual state and kind of land they occupy. If I may be allowed to say a few words before I am examined, I should like to say that I have no personal grievance. With regard to the factor, I have to say for him that if no good result is to accrue from my presence here, it will in a way be attributed to the factor, for if it were not for his generosity of heart and private liberality to me, I would not be here. With regard to what the people complain of, I have to say that this crofting hamlet of Laid is the most recently formed of all the settlements, in consequence of the evictions previous to 1835, the year when I first left the parish. Laid then was of so little account that there were only some kelp-workers' huts on the shore, that any person could reside in and do what he liked, without let or hindrance. The mountain slope rises from the water side, and the hamlet has a frontage of nearly two or three miles on the slope. The road runs parallel with the sea to the village, and the houses are between the road and the sea. The formation of the surface of the mountain is quartzite rock, and above this there is a",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",8
"9","cairn of the same material, which is chemically the same as flint, and a thin skin of peat over this, with the cairn protruding, so that there are only patches here and there between the protruding cairn which can be at all tilled. In dry weather this is traversed by currents of air in the fissures, and when the soil is dry and pulverises, this communicates with the cairn above; and in winter or spring the rain falls upon the whole mountain slope and runs down, because there are no depressions in the rock to store it, and it comes through this cairn and wells up through the cultivated soil, so that the tilled land becomes flooded, and it washes away the soil. In dry weather the soil is simply peat dust, which becomes, if there is a length of drought, as dry as chaff and nearly as light, and part is blown away with the winds. The general result is, that since the place was settled in 1835 many of the plots first brought under cultivation have disappeared; and with regard to the remaining plots, some half or more, the same process is going on, and in another generation or so the crofts will have to be left, because there will be no soil. There is a mountain torrent at the little hamlet, and there is a delta of gravel and quartzite sand of some three acres, where this stream enters the sea. The sand and gravel are not drifted away, so that this site, to any person of ordinary powers of observation and the least humanity, would be seen to be absolutely unfit for occupation. It was like penal servitude to put people to cultivate such a place.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",9
"10","26408. Where were the people brought from to that place, and why?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",10
"11","—-The first man that was put there by eviction was from the sheep farm of Erriboll.  He was sent there before the place was laid out. There was a fine green spot at the head of Loch Erriboll, where he had a small croft, and he was evicted, and settled where this stream is. He was a man who had served his country; he was a piper in the army, and was over in Ireland. He was a most inoffensive kind of man, and he was the first who was removed and settled there; and he died there. When I left the place for America, I and my father went to see him on his death-bed.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",11
"12","26409. How many more were sent with him?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",12
"13","—The last formed sheep farm was Rispond, and my maternal grandmother was evicted from Rispond, and had to settle here at Laid. Several other parties from Rispond sheep farm also settled there.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",13
"14","26410. How many families are there now altogether?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",14
"15","—There are altogether twenty-three families, but one of these, although in the same community, is the family of a keeper who has a croft.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",15
"16","26411. Are some of them cottars, or are they all crofters?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",16
"17","—There are nineteen crofts, and one is a cottar, who has a small spot near the boundary, and pays no rent; and I think there are two sub-crofters.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",17
"18","26412. What rent do they generally pay?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",18
"19","—The rents range, I think, from £ 1 to £ 1 , 15s.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",19
"20","26413. Are there none higher than that?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",20
"21","—No.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",21
"22","26414. What amount of stock are they able to keep?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",22
"23","—There are twenty-nine cows in the hamlet, I believe, and eleven stirks, making the whole number forty, which is nearly two beasts per family. There are, as far as I could ascertain, about 121 sheep, or five and a quarter per family. There is a population, taking an average, of a little over five to each family.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",23
"24","26415. Are there any of them able to make a living out of the land?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",24
"25","—No, certainly not.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",25
"26","26416. How long does the produce of their land support them generally?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",26
"27","—Since the potato failure it does not support them at all. The main benefit which they get from the corn produce in their crofts is to winter their beasts, and it is not sufficient for that; they have always every year to buy fodder for their cattle—to import it. One thing further that I should tell about the place is, that it is imperfectly sheltered; it is an even plane, which tells greatly against it. It is situated on the mountain slope, and there is no shelter from one end to the other. There is abundant shelter on the sheep farms about, but not at Laid.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",27
"28","26417. What means of living have the people?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",28
"29","—The only other means taken advantage of to get money by the most of the population is whelk",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",29
"30","gathering. These they commence to gather about the new year, and they continue to gather them untd they commence the crop cultivation in spring. Engaged in this work, in the most inclement season of the year, are women and half-clothed children, which tells most dreadfully against the constitutions of the children.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",30
"31","26418. Are there no fish?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",31
"32","—Yes, generally in Loch Erriboll there are fish which can be used for domestic purposes, but there is no market, and there is a great deal of decay in the families of a great many of them for some time now, from the active members going away. Many of them, although the fish are there, cannot get the benefit of them.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",32
"33","26419. Is there no cod or ling fishing?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",33
"34","—Not in the loch. They enter occasionally, but the principal fish caught are haddock and flounder, and at the mouth of the loch, at Rispond, cod and ling are abundant.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",34
"35","26420. Do none of the inhabitants regularly prosecute that fishing?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",35
"36","—No.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",36
"37","26421. Or herring fishing?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",37
"38","—The herring fishing is very poor in Loch Erriboll; some years there may be a few, but ordinarily they are not there.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",38
"39","26422. Do none of the men go to the east coast fishing?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",39
"40","—All those who are able are prosecuting, winter and spring, the lobster fishing.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",40
"41","26423. Is it good lobster fishing?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",41
"42","—Yes, it is as good as any here, but, as has been mentioned already, there is a great difficulty in getting lobsters in time for the market. They have to cart them sixty miles to Lairg.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",42
"43","26424. What have you to suggest for the improvement of the condition of the people—is it possible for them to get a comfortable subsistence out of that place?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",43
"44","—Not so far as I can see.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",44
"45","26425. Is there any land which, if added to their present crofts, would make them more comfortable?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",45
"46","—No there is no land. The big sheep farms of Rispond, on the one side, and Erriboll on the other, would in my opinion accommodate more than the present population of the parishes; but there is no other way of providing for them. There is a fertile limestone island; the peculiarity of this place is that there are various formations of limestone, gneiss and micaceous schist; and in this peculiar place there is not a particle of light soil but it goes away.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",46
"47","26426. Why was the place called Port-na-con",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",47
"48","—Port of Dogs—There is a tradition that there was a fight between a dog and Fingal.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",48
"49","26427. Perhaps it was thought fit only for dogs to inhabit?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",49
"50","—That would be a very good construction, because it is not fit.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",50
"51","26428. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",51
"52","—For human beings ?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",52
"53","—It is not. The marriageable young people are about equal in number, but I consider, especially the females, from delicacy of constitution and disease, very few are fit to rear healthy offspring. There is a number of young men, who have good constitutions, hardy and able. There are two families side by side, in which there are six young men who have been marriageable for the last ten years, and they have seen that the most misery is where there are large families. I think it is miserable that during youth these young men should not have sufficient subsistence, and I have been speaking to them, as I have been on intimate terms with them since I came, and they told me what deterred them from marrying was the misery they would entail upon their offspring. I think it is a deplorable state of things, that young men who are industrious and prudent and of good constitution, should be deterred from marrying from these considerations. I was born in Strathmore.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",53
"54","26429. The Chairman.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",54
"55","—At what period was Strathmore cleared?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",55
"56","—Just before I was born. I was removed when I was at the breast to Strathbeg, at the head of Loch Erriboll, and I resided there until I was twelve years of age, when my father removed to Nova Scotia. I have been residing at Laid for ten years.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",56
"57","26430. You consider there is a good deal of land in Strathmore capable of cultivation?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",57
"58","—Of profitable cultivation; and I am confident there is not half nor a third of the pasture growing in it that was growing in my young days. It is reverting to a state of nature—heather, ling and moss.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",58
"59","26431. Which side of the strath was the more populous—the side on which the road is or the other?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",59
"60","—The east side was the more populous.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",60
"61","26432. It was not so good a strath for cultivation as Strathnaver?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",61
"62","—I think it is about the best sheltered spot I know in the country. The soil is good on the floor of the strath, and the pasture is good; but it is very much smaller than Strathnaver.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",62
"63","26433. When was it cleared —about what year? was it all done at once or gradually?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",63
"64","—I am not able to answer that question just now, because it was cleared when my father left, or before that.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",64
"65","26431. Is it in the Reay country?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",65
"66","—Yes, it is in the parish from which I am delegated.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",66
"67","26435. Was it cleared before it was purchased by the Sutherland family or after?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",67
"68","—I am not able positively to say, but my impression is that it was cleared before the Sutherland family got the estate.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",68
"69","26436. Do you think there are many of the people in your poor settlement here who would be glad to be transported into Strathmore, and who would be able to form crofts?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",69
"70","—Undoubtedly, if they could get crofts there upon terms that they could settle upon. But in my hamlet the people are so poor that they have no means to settle unless they get accommodation.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",70
"71","26437. How many of these poor people in the place you speak of have got friends abroad or in Scotland who would be able to assist them?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",71
"72","—I am not aware. I know a few have friends in Australia. I know a widow who has a son in Australia who sends his mother assistance.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",72
"73","26438. You have been in Nova Scotia; is there any land there still available near the coast for the purpose of a settlement for emigrants from this country?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",73
"74","—Oh ! yes.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",74
"75","26439. Is land there still cheap?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",75
"76","—I believe it is.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",76
"77","26440. Do you think Nova Scotia a colony well adapted for settlement from here?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",77
"78","—Yes, I think so; but I think Australia and New Zealand are more eligible.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",78
"79","26441. Is the voyage there not much more expensive?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",79
"80","—It is.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",80
"81","26442. Would the people find more facilities for fishing and practising their natural industries in Nova Scotia?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",81
"82","—I don't know, because along the coast in Nova Scotia fishing is one of the principal industries, and the strip of land along the coast is nearly all bought up and occupied by the fishermen. Those who are to settle now must go back into the interior, and live by farming.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",82
"83","26443. Do you think the fishing population on the coast of Nova Scotia happier and more prosperous than the corresponding class of people here?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",83
"84","—There is no comparison between them.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",84
"85","26444. Would you advise your countrymen, unless they got land, to emigrate and settle abroad?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",85
"86","—My view of that question is this—I can say that both in North America and New Zealand, I have seen the same class of men working the same as the crofter class here, and because they were certain of the fruits of the labour and industry which they expended upon the soil, they made their places like a gentleman's house; they had the orchards and gardens and fields in such a state. They had there this great inducement to persevering industry which the people here don't understand that they want, because they never had the advantage of it. I look upon them as eagles reared in a cage, who don't know what they could do if they were free. My view as to emigration is that we should not force the people to go, nor prevent those who are willing, but put them under just and free conditions, so that they might be equally well off here.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",86
"87","26445. Professor Mackinnon.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",87
"88","—Do you think it would be advisable to have a pier at Rispond?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",88
"89","—I think so; I think it would be in the interest of everybody. There would be no opposition to it, and I think it would be a great advantage to the whole place. There is a mine of wealth in the sea there, if it could be made available, and it never can be made available until there is a sufficient pier made at Rispond.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",89
"90","26446. Is the place suitable?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",90
"91","—It is the most suitable we have. The expense might be very considerable, but it would be a permanent boon to the place.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",91
"92","26447. It would open up the place?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",92
"93","—It would, and would enable men to live by fishing, who have no means of living now.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",93
"94","26448. They would be able to send fish to the market, which they are not able to do now?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",94
"95","—Yes.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",95
"96","26449. I suppose your meaning with regard to emigration is that the young eagle should fly towards Strathmore rather than Nova Scotia?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",96
"97","—Let it fly where it likes.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",97
"98","26450. But you think that would be the best way to start matters?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",98
"99","—Yes.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",99
"100","26451. And then after that place was peopled, let them search for other places : is that what you mean?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",100
"101","—Yes. My own view is that it would be better for the colonies if the people were to emigrate there, and no doubt, in present circumstances, it would be better for the people; but I think it would be better for this country if the people had these natural inducements. At present whatever a man does in improving his lot, even as a workman, the Duke is heir to it, and this is demoralising, because the people can never acquire industrious habits and the spirit for industry which they would have if they were differently situated.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",101
"102","26452. I suppose the place where they are just now is so bad that it would not be worth giving it to them, even with certainty of tenure?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",102
"103","—No. Perhaps two or three persons could live there by the cattle run, but there are twenty-three just now.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",103
"104","26453. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",104
"105","—When were you last in Strathmore ?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",105
"106","—Last summer.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",106
"107","26451. Do you know how high up the glen people were once living?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",107
"108","—They were living up as far as the shooting cottages at the head of the main stream. It then branches into several rivers at the new forest.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",108
"109","26455. Where two or three large streams meet at Gobnanuisgeich?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",109
"110","—Yes.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",110
"111","26456. There were actually families living there?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",111
"112","—Yes.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",112
"113","26457. All the year ?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",113
"114","—Yes.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",114
"115","26458. It was not a small shieling merely?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",115
"116","—No.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",116
"117","26459. And were living from there all the way down?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",117
"118","—Yes; on the slopes of Loch Hope below, there were some settlements; but there is a great deal of land which is the debris of mica schist and micaceous flagstones, which could be tilled profitably.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",118
"119","26460. Have you any idea how many souls, when the place was fully occupied, there would be from the ferry up to the place at the meeting of the waters?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",119
"120","—I have no data from which I could answer that question.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",120
"121","26461. Would there be several hundred souls, not families?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",121
"122","—I think there would be 200 at any rate.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",122
"123","26462. You have travelled over the world and seen a good deal, and studied many things. We saw an old tower there; can you tell us very briefly what it once was?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",123
"124","—I don't know; it is a prehistoric ruin. There are several similar ruins there. There are some even in the top of high hills, and it would be a puzzle to know why human beings resided in such exposed situations.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",124
"125","26463. What story have the people themselves about this tower? It is called Dornadilla's Tower?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",125
"126","—There is one story that the stones were taken from a very long distance, but I can give no story about it, which would give any satisfactory explanation. There are others nearer where I live now, the remains of old ruins, which I have explored, and I find that those who had these strongholds lived upon shell fish and animals of the chase. I have got the teeth of very large graminivorous animals, as large as horses and cows, and I sent some of them to the late Professor of Natural History in Aberdeen, but although he knew they were the teeth of graminiverous animals, he could not make out the species. I think they may have been teeth of the Irish elk.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",126
"127","26464. But you don't know anything about this tower in Strathmore?",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",127
"128","—No.",445,"Donald Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",128
