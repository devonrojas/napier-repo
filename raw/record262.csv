"1","NORMAN M'ARTHUR, Crofter and Fisherman, Borrowston (32) —examined.",262,"Norman Mcarthur","Lewis, Breasclete",1
"2","14920. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",262,"Norman Mcarthur","Lewis, Breasclete",2
"3","—Have you anything to say in addition to what has been said?",262,"Norman Mcarthur","Lewis, Breasclete",3
"4","—I have to speak of the trouble we have in respect of the mill. We are more than six miles from the mill here. We have to give the miller every year the one-sixteenth part of our grain, besides our trouble, and if we have only three pecks, we have that same trouble to undergo—twelve miles to travel. We had old mills of our own, which we used formerly; and we think it a hardship that we should be obliged to keep up this mill, while we are also obliged to buy meal for our support elsewhere.",262,"Norman Mcarthur","Lewis, Breasclete",4
"5","14921. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",262,"Norman Mcarthur","Lewis, Breasclete",5
"6","—Are you allowed to grind meal in your own mills ?",262,"Norman Mcarthur","Lewis, Breasclete",6
"7","—The old mills are forbidden entirely. That is under article 30 of regulations. We think if we were allowed to resume the use of our own old mills, as we did before, it would be a relief to us.",262,"Norman Mcarthur","Lewis, Breasclete",7
