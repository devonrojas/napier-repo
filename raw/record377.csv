"1","JAMES ROBERTSON, Happy Hansel, Parish of Walls (37)—examined.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",1
"2","21702. The Chairman.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",2
"3","—Are you a delegate, or do you appear here on your own account?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",3
"4","—I appear as a delegate.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",4
"5","21703. How many persons took part in your election?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",5
"6","—Probably fifty or sixty.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",6
"7","21704. What statement did they desire that you should make on their behalf?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",7
"8","—They wish fair and fixed rents, and security of tenure, and also compensation for improvements. A meeting of crofters in the parish of Walla was held in Old Happy Hansel school, on 2nd July 1883, for the purpose of appointing delegates to appear before the Royal Commissioners, and state the grievances of the crofters in this district. Mr J. D. Robertson was unanimously elected chairman, and stated to the meeting the purpose for which the Royal Commission had been appointed. After some conversation it was unanimously agreed to, that the following were the principal grievances of which the crofters have to complain, viz.:",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",8
"9","1. Excessively high rents. The rent charged for land in this locality is much beyond its productive value, land being generally of inferior quality. The rents in many cases have been doubled during the last thirty years. ",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",9
"10","2. The crofters in Walls have no security of tenure, but are entirely at the mercy of the laird or factor, who at any time may drive them to the fields by giving forty days' notice. This state of matters is felt to be a very great hardship, and gives no encouragement to tenants to improve their holdings. ",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",10
"11","3. Although a tenant may improve the land he occupies to the fullest extent, yet on his having to leave the croft, by his own wish or by the order of the laird and factor, he cannot claim for any of the mprovements he may have executed, but must walkout whether any compensation is allowed or not.  The crushing burden of rates which the tenant has to pay presses very heavily on the people in this district, and tends to pauperise them. The poor and school rates alone amount to the sum of 7s. 9d. per pound, the half of which is payable by tenants. Although road money is paid, scarcely any of it is expended in country districts. The state of the roads in many places during the winter are a source of danger to the community. ",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",11
"12","The foregoing are the principal grievances from which the crotters suffer, and this meeting would humbly recommend to the notice of the Royal Commissioners that an alteration of the existing state of things, so as to ameliorate the condition of crofters, has become a dire necessity. The law would require to be changed so that the crofters could have the following privdeges, viz.:",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",12
"13","(1) security of tenure, with the existing scathold as formerly held; ",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",13
"14","(2) a fair and fixed rent; ",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",14
"15","(3) compensation for improvements , ",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",15
"16","(4) reduction of local rents by subsidy from Government to parishes where the rents exceed 5s. per pound. ",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",16
"17","Mr J. D. Robertson and Mr John Jamieson were appointed delegates.' (signed) J. D. ROBERTSON, Chairman, JOHN JAMIESON, and by sixty-nine others. On 7th July an adjourned meeting of crofters was held, when the foregoing statement was read, and unanimously approved of by all present.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",17
"18","21705. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",18
"19","—It is stated in this paper that the crofters in Walls have no security of tenure; as a matter of fact, are",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",19
"20","removals frequent?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",20
"21","—No.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",21
"22","21706. Is there much room for improvement of the crofts if security of tenure were given?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",22
"23","—Yes, much room.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",23
"24","21707. What size of croft do you hold?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",24
"25","—A small croft of about a couple of acres or thereby.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",25
"26","21708. Is it all arable land?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",26

"31","—Yes, everybody has some.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",31
"32","21711. Except you?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",32
"33","—Yes, almost everybody.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",33
"34","21712. Has any one in your recollection added to his croft by improving the land?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",34
"35","—Yes, many.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",35
"36","21713. Have rents been increased in consequence?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",36
"37","—They have.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",37
"38","21714. Can you mention an instance where land was improved and the rent consequently increased?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",38
"39","—I cannot say it has been increased in consequence, but it has been increased very quickly after the improvement.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",39
"40","21715. Give us an instance of that?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",40
"41","—There is the case of Lawrence Jamieson.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",41

"44","21717. How much of that has he improved?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",44
"45","—He was the incoming tenant; the rent was raised when he came in on account of improvements.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",45
"46","21718. The outgoing tenant had improved the land;",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",46
"47","—Yes.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",47
"48","21719. Why did the outgoing tenant leave it?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",48
"49","—Force of circumstances, not the will of the laird.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",49
"50","21720. He was not able to pay the rent?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",50
"51","—He was not able to work the land; he had too few of a family.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",51

"53","—No",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",53

"74","21732. What quantity do you raise?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",74
"75","—It is rather a hard question.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",75
"76","21733. Do you use them all yourself?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",76
"77","—Yes, all of them.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",77
"78","21734. How long do they keep you?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",78
"79","—We are supposed to have as many as we require until the new ones come in again.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",79
"80","21735. Do you build your own houses, or does the landlord do it?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",80
"81","—The house I occupy is an old one, and I do the repairs on it myself.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",81
"82","21736. It was originally built by the proprietor?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",82
"83","—Yes.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",83
"84","21737. Is it a slated house?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",84

"89","21739. Is it to the School Board you pay your rent?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",89

"91","21740. What has become of the four rooms?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",91
"92","—The partition and bulkheads of most of them are away.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",92
"93","21741. Who removed the partitions?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",93
"94","—Time.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",94
"95","21742. Are your potatoes sufficient to keep you for a year?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",95
"96","—Yes.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",96
"97","21743. And you consider £4 a very high rent for that?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",97
"98","—Yes, and consequently refuse to pay i t; that is the reason I say I don't pay the rent.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",98

"106","—I don't know if he has any; but that don't interfere with the croft.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",106
"107","21748. That is on account of the scathold?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",107
"108","—Yes, most of those who have ponies pay no rent; the hills are open.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",108
"109","21749. Is it the custom of people who pay no rent to make use of the scathold ground?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",109
"110","—Yes.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",110
"111","21750. Do you hold that they have a right to do so?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",111
"112","—They make a right any way; there have been no objections raised to their having a pony or two.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",112
"113","21751. And if a tenant keeps a pony on the scathold you don't count that part of his rights?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",113
"114","—No, he may keep one or a hundred, and no one interferes.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",114

"123","—No, I am not aware of any. ",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",123
"124","21756. Is there no such thing known?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",124
"125","—No, I think not. ",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",125
"126","21757. You are entirely tenants at will?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",126
"127","—Yes.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",127
"128","21758. I think you said the people are very willing to improve if they were sure they would not be turned out without the value of their improvements?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",128
"129","—Yes.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",129
"130","21759. Who is proprietor of the land about?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",130
"131","—There is no one proprietor; it is a sort of republic; there are about twenty.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",131
"132","21760. But a republic without liberty?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",132
"133","—Without much liberty.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",133
"134","21761. Mr Cameron.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",134
"135","—You mean too much liberty?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",135
"136","—Yes, too much.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",136
"137","21762. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",137
"138","—What is the biggest rent of any single member of the republic?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",138
"139","—I don't know of any above £5 or £6, except house tenants.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",139
"140","21763. None of the people who signed the paper you read are landlords themselves?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",140
"141","—Yes, one small landlord signed that paper.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",141
"142","21764. To whom do the bulk of the people who signed the paper pay rents?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",142
"143","—To Mr Scott, the laird of Melby.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",143
"144","21765. Is he the proprietor of the island of Foula?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",144
"145","—Yes.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",145
"146","21766. Does he live near you?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",146
"147","—Yes, just a few miles over the hills.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",147
"148","21767. Does he reside there the most of the year?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",148
"149","—Yes; he is not of age yet",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",149
"150","21768. Who has charge of the estate?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",150
"151","—Mr Garriock, Raewick.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",151

"153","—Not so far as I know.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",153
"154","21770. Does the proprietor or those who act for him lay out any money in improving the estate?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",154
"155","—Yes, there is some laid out in making new houses; there is so much given, and the tenant does the rest.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",155
"156","21771. Is that going on just now?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",156
"157","—Yes.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",157
"158","21772. You have no complaint, so far as houses are concerned?|",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",158
"159","—No, no particular complaint. All the repairs are done by the tenant.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",159
"160","21773. You state in the paper that the crushing burden of rates which the tenants have to pay presses very heavily upon the people of the district, and tends to pauperise them; whose fault is it that the burdens are so heavy?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",160
"161","—That is a question we cannot decide.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",161
"162","21774. You are not the causes of it yourselves, are you?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",162
"163","—I don't think it.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",163
"164","21775. Don't you think it is as much the interest of the proprietor as the tenants to keep down the rates?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",164
"165","—Yes, more so.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",165
"166","21 776. Do you know what the school rate is in the parish of Walls?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",166
"167","—I think 2s. 7d. in the pound of rental this year; it will be better than 3s. in the pound next year.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",167
"168","21777. One half payable by the landlord and one half by the tenant?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",168
"169","—Yes.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",169
"170","21778. What is the poor rate?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",170
"171","—2s. 6d. I think on each side, on the nett rent, not the gross.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",171
"172","21779. You complain of the road money, is that a heavy assessment?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",172
"173","—I think 6d. in the pound.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",173
"174","21780. Do you pay in Walls an ecclesiastical assessment —an assessment for the church or manse, or something which was done some years ago ?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",174
"175","—No, not exactly; it was simply a raising of rent, and no cause given. It was not paid for church buildings or parochial buildings; it was simply a rise of rent at the time the parochial buildings were put up, some twelve or fourteen years ago.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",175
"176","21781. And it still continues?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",176
"177","—And in all probability will.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",177
"178","21782. Do you recollect when it was first put on?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",178
"179","—I think it was in 1869, but I cannot say exactly.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",179
"180","21783. What makes the people in Foula, where we were yesterday, think that an ecclesiastical rent?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",180
"181","—The opposition of religious matters, I suppose.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",181
"182","21781. But your receipts don't bear that it is an ecclesiastical burden?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",182
"183","—Not in the least.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",183
"184","21785. One of the things you ask is a reduction of local rates by a subsidy from Government, in parishes where the rates exceed 5s. per pound; who made the suggestion at the meeting that the Government should relieve you of part of the rates?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",184
"185","—I think it was I myself, if I remember rightly.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",185
"186","21786. Where did you get that idea?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",186
"187","—The Government now gives us help towards maintaining lunatics, and they pay a certain proportion to the doctor for the poor, and in a place where the rates are heavy, why should they not pay something towards the maintenance of the poor as well.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",187
"188","21787. That was what passed through your mind when you made that suggestion?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",188
"189","—Yes; they help in one direction, and why not in another, when the burden is so high? Next year the school rate may be half as much more than it is now.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",189
"190","21788. Are the school buildings not all yet erected?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",190
"191","—No, not yet.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",191
"192","21789. The Chairman.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",192
"193","—You stated that you use almost all your ground for the raising of potatoes?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",193
"194","—Yes, I don't raise any corn.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",194
"195","21790. Do you sell any potatoes?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",195
"196","—No, I very rarely sell any.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",196
"197","21791. Do you always cultivate the same ground for potatoes, or do you observe any rotation?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",197
"198","—All round are shifting.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",198
"199","21792. Do you shift ?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",199
"200","—Not always.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",200
"201","21793. Do you observe a rotation?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",201
"202","—No, no regular rotation.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",202
"203","21794. Do you keep a cow?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",203
"204","—Not at present.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",204
"205","21795. How do you manure the ground?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",205

"207","21796. You don't use any sea-weed?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",207
"208","—No, it is rather too far away.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",208
"209","21797. Do you find that the ground is exhausted?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",209
"210","—No doubt, it will. be exhausted in the long run.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",210
"211","21798. You said that most of the tenants in the neighbourhood paid rent to Mr Scott of Melby, do any pay rent to Adie?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",211
"212","—Not in our immediate neighbourhood.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",212
"213","21799. I thought you were at Voe?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",213
"214","—I am at Voe, Walls, and Adie's property is at Voe, Delting.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",214
"215","21800. Are the tenants on Mr Scott of Melby's ground under any obligation to fish for any particular person?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",215

"221","21803. Is there any township very far from the high road?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",221

"223","21804. Is there any kind of track a cart could go along?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",223

"225","21805. Has the proprietor ever done anything towards making a road?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",225
"226","—The Road Trustees commenced a road, and made a small bit at each end, and then stopped.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",226
"227","21806. The proprietors and tenants have never done anything towards making a road?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",227
"228","—Nothing worthy of the name.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",228
"229","21807. Have they made an attempt to make a road?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",229

"239","21812. But it was not specified in your papers that it was on account of the manse and repairs?-",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",239
"240","—No, simply a rise all over.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",240
"241","21813. Do you think there was any connection between the building of the manse and the raising of the rent? ",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",241
"242","— Certainly, the laird had to get the money from some quarter, and make good the difference.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",242
"243","21814. Was it the general impression of the people that the one thing was caused by the other?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",243

"245","21815. There are, I suppose, some people belonging to the Established Church?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",245
"246","—I think the majority—perhaps not a majority of the parish, but a majority of the church-going people —belong to the Established Church.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",246
"247","21816. And the Established Church people thought so themselves?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",247

"253","21819. Have you any other statement you wish to make?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",253

"255","21820. You wish security of tenure? How long do you think a lease ought to be?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",255

"257","21821. You think if they had that they would give satisfaction?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",257
"258","—Yes, I think it would give great satisfaction. There is an unwritten law now supposed to exist—and that is what is wanted to be altered —that is, as long as a man is honest and pays his rent, he may remain. There have been no evictions amongst us for sake of sheep; the great grievance is that the proprietor should take advantage of the law, and enclose the scathold, and leave them worse than nothing. It is evil to come that we fear; we have had advantages in Walls which they have not had anywhere in Shetland.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",258
"259","21822. I thought Hillswick was as well off as Walls?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",259
"260","—Not in times past. We have a number of proprietors and lairds, and amongst the lot we have more liberty than the people elsewhere. A great advantage in keeping down rents was emigration to New Zealand and owing to the natural formation of the parish, it cannot be let for farms.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",260
"261","21823. When the people went away, did they go of their own accord?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",261

"264","—By free emigration.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",264
"265","21825. Did any agent come to explain to them?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",265
"266","—Yes, there were travelling agents about that time.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",266
"267","21826. How did the people find money to go?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",267
"268","—There was no money required; the emigration was free.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",268
"269","21827. When they got abroad, were they given land?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",269
"270","—No, they just worked at the best thing that turned up.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",270
"271","21828. How did they succeed?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",271
"272","—As a rule, all well.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",272

"274","—Yes.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",274

"277","21831. How was the money recovered from those who were taken out free?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",277
"278","—It never was recovered; it was the New Zealand Government that took them out, not private individuals.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",278
"279","21832. Were whole families taken, or only men?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",279
"280","—Whole families, men, women, and children; but families had to find their own way to London.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",280
"281","21833. Did the Government supply them with food, or did they take their own provisions?",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",281
"282","—The Government supplied them.",377,"James Robertson","Shetland, Lerwick",282
