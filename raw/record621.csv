"6","—Yes.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",6
"7","37510. Is he holding a croft himself?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",7
"8","—Yes.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",8

"11","37512. On whose property?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",11
"12","—On the Duke of Portland's property.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",12
"13","37513. Is that near Lybster?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",13
"14","—About a mile west from Lybster.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",14
"15","37514. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",15
"16","—Are you delegated here by the people on the Duke of Portland's estate?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",16
"17","—Yes.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",17
"18","37515. Have you any statement to make on their behalf?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",18
"19","—Yes, I have prepared a statement.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",19
"20","—' The rents on Swiney estate were raised three times during my memory. It was always by a rise of rent we knew our improvements were taken notice of. In 1846, a lawyer factor named Morrison Snody increased each crofter's rent £1, 10s. to £ 3; but death removed him before the increase became due, and the greatest regret was that the burdens which he imposed could not be got free of as easily as himself. The next increase was under the proprietorship of the late General Gordon twenty-two years ago. The poor rates being raised to four shillings per pound —two shillings on proprietor and two on the tenant. In order that the general might stave off his own share of the rates, he clapped 10 per cent, immediately on every tenant not protected by lease. Besides, no opportunity was lost of increasing the rents when a change of tenancy occurred, or when a sitting tenant drew a lease. But the third, last, and worst, the climax of cruelty was in 1875, when we got a fiscal factor named Malcolm M'Lennan, a Lewisman, who still resides in Wick. Under this oppressor our rents in many instances wore raised over one-third. And in attempting to come to terms with him for our crofts, it was all in vain to plead by word or letter, how unlikely his demands were, for he never wanted as much of a barbarian's charity, but could tell us "" If you don't agree to my terms, another will when I advertise your place."" In consequence of M'Lennau's exorbitant rents, a shameful number of evictions took place; and owing to his opposition the meliorations of some of the evicted are still unpaid. He imposed heavy fines on others for carting a few loads of mossy earth to their "" middens,"" or even cutting peats, although five-sixths of the estate's surface is peaty ground. The tenants who had no other shift but to comply with M'Lennan's proposals were also fined, for every form of lease wherewith they were more effectually "" tied down "" cost one-fifth or sixth of a year's rent, being his fixed price for a sheet or two of paper and their contents; whereas other tenants on neighbouring estates got leases fully as good but free of cost. In 1878 the estate of Swiney was purchased by the Duke of Portland, and in consequence of high rents and bad seasons we were compelled to implore his Grace three times for relief—twice we asked reduction of rent, and the other time many who were in extreme need sent in their petitions in the spring time, requesting some help in seed oats. All our petitions were answered indifferently, or treated with silent contempt, except a small consideration granted in the name of a reduction; but even that itself, in our opinion, was shared out with amazing partiality. Hence our recent action in behalf of submitting our grievances to the investigation of a Royal Commission.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",20
"21","37516. Was it the custom to give meliorations on this estate?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",21
"22","—Yes, it was the custom.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",22
"23","37517. For what?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",23
"24","—For the wood of the roofing of the house.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",24
"25","37518. Were meliorations given for anything except the roof of the house?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",25
"26","—Nothing that I know of. We got no compensations for any improvements or buildings.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",26
"27","37519. What extent of land does your father hold?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",27
"28","—Nine acres.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",28
"29","37520. What is his rent?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",29
"30","—The rent, by the increase which M'Lennan put on us, was £10, 10s., but the reduction I referred to cut off about £1 of it. M'Lennan put £3, 10s. of increase upon it, and Snody put 30s. upon it.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",30
"31","37521. How long is it since your father first went to this place 1",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",31
"32","—Thirtynine years ago.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",32
"33","37522. Was it bare moor when he went there?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",33
"34","—There were only three acres of it cultivated at the time.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",34
"35","37523. Was there a house?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",35
"36","—There was a sort of a house.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",36
"37","37524. Had he any lease when he went there first of all?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",37
"38","—None.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",38
"39","37525. He improved the land without any lease?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",39
"40","—Without any lease.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",40
"41","37520. Had he any promise that he would have the place for a certain time?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",41
"42","—None.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",42
"43","37527. Had he any idea that he would be left there for ever at the same rent?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",43
"44","—Well, there was no guarantee.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",44
"45","37528. I am not speaking of guarantee. I am speaking of the impression he himself was under?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",45
"46","—There was no promise, but then we were improving the land for our own benefit; indeed the late General Gordon put a check upon it. He said —' There is no use trenching or improving that land unless you agree with me for a rent; and if your offer pleases me I will accept of it, and if not I will advertise the place.' He even at one time put a stop to open drainage.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",46
"47","37529. Were you objecting to pay any increase, or was it the amount of the increase?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",47
"48","—We never objected, but we always grudged its enormity.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",48
"49","37530. What do you think now would be a fair rent to give for this place which you yourself improved?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",49
"50","—I think 6s. 6d. or 7s. an acre would be a full rent for it, going to the outside of it. There are many other crofts that would be dear at 2s. 6d. per acre, and some not worth labouring in their present state.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",50
"51","37531. Then 7s. an acre would be the same rent that you paid when you entered in 1846?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",51
"52","—That is it.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",52
"53","37532. You think it should not rise beyond that?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",53
"54","—Well, if there was anything granted us for our improvements; but all the labour is due to our own energy and expense.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",54
"55","37533. The Chairman.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",55
"56","—What was the first rent your father paid for the place?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",56
"57","—£5.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",57
"58","37531. Did you not say that in 1846 it rose from £ 1 , 10s. to £3?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",58
"59","—Yes.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",59
"60","37535. What was it that rose from £1, 10s. to £3?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",60
"61","—That was over the whole estate in general. I am not sure that each crofter's rent was raised equally.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",61
"62","37536. But your father's original rent when he went to the place was£ 5?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",62
"63","—Yes.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",63
"64","37537. And now it is £9, 10s.?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",64
"65","—Yes, it was for a few years at £10.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",65
"66","37538. And during that period has any proprietor laid out anything or afforded you or your family any assistance?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",66
"67","—Not a farthing.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",67
"68","37539. How many years is it since your father went there?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",68
"69","—Thirtynine years.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",69
"70","37540. And you say that you ought to have it now for the same rent it was at first? You think that would be a fair rent?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",70
"71","—I say that 7s. an acre is rent enough.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",71
"72","37541. So you think you ought now to give £2 less than your father gave for it at the beginning?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",72
"73","—Well, it would scarcely recoup our labour in draining, trenching, and manure.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",73
"74","37542. How is the rent practically paid? Is it paid by the sale of an animal?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",74
"75","—By an animal or by crop, but very seldom by either. It is often done by external labour. We pay our rents generally by working otherwise.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",75
"76","37543. What stock do you keep upon this little farm?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",76
"77","—One horse, one cow, a stirk, and maybe a calf.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",77
"78","37544. Do you never keep more than one cow1?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",78
"79","—It would not support more than one cow.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",79
"80","37545. Have you ever, practically speaking, more than one cow in your byre?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",80
"81","—Yes, sometimes there are two.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",81
"82","37546. Are there ever three?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",82
"83","—But there are other outlets upon another estate on which they pasture.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",83
"84","37547. What is the name of the township?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",84
"85","—Achow.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",85
"86","37548. You consider it is a township?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",86
"87","—Yes.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",87
"88","37549. You consider you belong to a crofting township?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",88
"89","—Yes..",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",89
"90","37550. What is the connection between the crofts? Have they got any common pasture?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",90
"91","—None.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",91
"92","37551. Had they ever any common pasture?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",92
"93","—Achow had no common pasture; but other parts of the estate had common pasture.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",93
"94","37552. Had your township ever any sheiling ground?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",94
"95","—None that I am aware of.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",95
"96","37553. Had it never any rights of common pasture at all?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",96
"97","—None outside the tenant's own pasture.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",97
"98","37554. Is it a very old township?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",98
"99","—I am told there was scarcely a croft in it about eighty or ninety years ago.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",99
"100","37555. Where do you think the people came from?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",100
"101","—They came there, a good many of them, in consequence of the Sutherland evictions in 1818 or 1820, and some of them before that—back to 1810.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",101
"102","37556. Do the people still remember that they came from Sutherland? ",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",102
"103","—Yes. ",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",103
"104","37557. And they look upon themselves as Sutherland men?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",104
"105","—As strangers.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",105
"106","37558. Was your family a Sutherland family?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",106
"107","—Partly.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",107
"108","37559. With regard to the old townships on the country, had they as a rule common pastures and sheiling ground, or had they sometimes none at all?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",108
"109","—They had common pastures for the most part, and sheiling ground, outlaying pasture common to each tenant.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",109
"110","37560. When those people came from Sutherland and settled in your place, who was the proprietor that took them in?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",110
"111","—Old Swiney Gordon, the father of the General Gordon to whom I have referred.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",111
"112","37561. What family succeeded the Gordons'?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",112
"113","—The last of the Gordons we had was a sort of half Gordon or Yankee, but the estate was sold out",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",113
"114","of his hands to the Duke of Portland, and that was the cause of the immense increase of rent; M'Lennan was principally put in, I believe, to roup us up for the market.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",114
"115","37562. The high rent was imposed in order to sell the estate to advantage?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",115
"116","—Just a year before the sale, M'Lenuan came in early in 1874, and we were sold in 1878.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",116
"117","37563. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",117
"118","—It was the late Duke of Portland who bought the property?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",118
"119","—Yes, he died in the beginning of 1879.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",119
"120","37564. You represent in the paper you have given in, that you made three applications to his Grace?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",120
"121","—We did, as an estate.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",121
"122","37565. Was that to the late or to the present Duke?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",122
"123","—To the present Duke. The first application indeed went in before the late Duke's decease, but there was no response to it for about a year afterwards, when the reduction took place.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",123
"124","37566. What is the name of the gentleman who has charge of the Portland estates in Caithness now?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",124
"125","—Mr James Muckart, factor, Langwell, Berriedale.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",125
"126","37567. You complain that the reductions of rent are partial; whose doing is that?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",126
"127","—I cannot account for that, but there are some tenants in our township who have got far worse reductions than others in proportion to what they occupy.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",127
"128","37568. You do not blame the proprietor for that?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",128
"129","—No. There was one Alexander Sutherland, Bravell, Swiney, who got no reduction, and in common justice should get a reduction. He pays £14. Donald Gunn, Swiney Mains, also got no reduction.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",129
"130","37569. Has the present proprietor ever come among you at all?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",130
"131","—Yes.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",131
"132","37570. Have the tenants come into personal contact with him?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",132
"133","—Yes, there was a reception here three years ago when he came north.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",133
"134","37571. Do you not think, as he is a young man, lately come into a very fine estate, it would be well to approach him directly with regard to any grievances you have?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",134
"135","—Well, there were two approaches of late. I am not sure if the latest approach came under his notice, but the other approach, which was occasioned by the poor crop of 1881, came under his notice without any profitable results,—the second approach for reduction. The crop that year was remarkably poor. In fact, we paid £ 3 per boll that year for meal.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",135
"136","37572. So far as you are aware, except the matter of the rent, there is no other complaint on the part of the tenants on the estate you represent?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",136
"137","—Well, I think some of the crofts are far too small. T here is a complaint too that the land is very bad, but that is included in the complaint of too much rent. The quality of the land is very bad.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",137
"138","37573. Are there farms upon the estate that could be given up for the enlargement of the smaller crofts?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",138
"139","—There are two pretty large farms on the estate—the farm of Swiney and the farm of Reisgill.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",139
"140","37574. Are these suitable for breaking up?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",140
"141","—I would not say but they are. I leave them to the powers that be.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",141
"142","37575. With regard to the people who came from Sutherland long ago, who consider themselves still strangers in Caithness, do they still preserve the Gaelic language? Do they speak Gaelic?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",142
"143","—Not so much as they were wont to do in my earlier days, but there is a good sprinkling of Gaelic",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",143
"144","among them.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",144
"145","37576. Do you speak Gaelic yourself?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",145
"146","—Yes.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",146
"147","37577. Sheriff Nicolson.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",147
"148","—How small are these crofts that you say are too small?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",148
"149","—Some of them are only 2, 2½ , or 3 acres. Some of the people are not able to keep horses, and they pay immensely dear for laying down their crops in spring to keep horses and have five or six acres.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",149
"150","37578. What stock can they keep who have these small crofts?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",150
"151","—In general, one cow and a calf, and maybe a sheep.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",151
"152","37579. There are none I suppose without cows?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",152
"153","—There are some who have no cows.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",153
"154","37579*. Are there many of them that don't make their livings out of the crofts?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",154
"155","—I don't know but the smallest share of them make their living out of the crofts. They draw their living from extraneous sources, such as labouring or fishing. They are very poor indeed. I knew one industrious crofter lately who was so poor that she had even to borrow clothes and shoes from a pauper when she went out to pay her poor-rate, to go out decently.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",155
"156","37580. What size of croft do you consider sufficient to support a family independently of other sources of income?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",156
"157","—15, 20, 25, or 30 acres.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",157
"158","37581. Is the number of that size in your neighbourhood very small?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",158
"159","—There are a few.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",159
"160","37582. Who are able to make a comfortable living out of their crofts?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",160
"161","—Well, the fishing helps them considerably.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",161
"162","37583. Are most of them fishermen as well?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",162
"163","—A proportion of them.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",163
"164","37581. Is their fishing confined to the herring fishing entirely?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",164
"165","—Almost entirely. A few near the sea-coast fish cod and haddocks, but it is merely for the benefit of their own families.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",165
"166","37585. Who is the present factor?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",166
"167","—Mr Muckart",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",167
"168","37586. Is he an Englishman?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",168
"169","—He is from the south.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",169
"170","37587. How long was Mr M'Lennan factor?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",170
"171","—Too long.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",171
"172","37588. How many years?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",172
"173","—He was three years our factor.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",173
"174","37589. Why did he cease to be factor?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",174
"175","—When the Duke of Portland purchased the estate, the late Mr Bowler of Berriedale became factor, and Mr Muckart succeeded him.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",175
"176","37590. Is there any difference in administering the estate since the new proprietor and factor came?",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",176
"177","—I find no difference, only that when we meet at rent day we are all good friends.",621,"James Millar","Caithness, Lybster",177
