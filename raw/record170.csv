"1","Captain ALLAN MACDONALD, Proprietor of Waternish (60)—examined.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",1
"2","9663. The Chairman.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",2
"3","—Do you desire to make a statement to the Commission?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",3
"4","—I have no statement. I was not aware that I would be called upon to make any statement.(see Appendix A. VII for statement)",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",4
"5","9664. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",5
"6","—I suppose you have read in the papers the account of our inquiry of Waternish the other day?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",6
"7","—I did.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",7
"8","9665. Have you anything to say in reference to what was stated by the witnesses there?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",8
"9","—Yes, with regard to removals; and that I occupied townships which had been in the possession of crofters, which I did not.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",9
"10","9666. Do you say there have been no removals?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",10
"11","—Certainly, no removals.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",11
"12","9667. The people complain of being crowded and having too little land",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",12
"13","—I am not astonished at it.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",13
"14","9668. Would it be possible to give them any more?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",14
"15","—I do not think so. Since I entered into possession I have given them 1500 acres in addition to what they had before, and should I give them 1500 more. I think they will be equally crowded in the course of a little time.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",15
"16","9669. Then the population has increased in your time by the natural increase of the people?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",16
"17","—Yes.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",17
"18","9670. You have not taken people in from outside1?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",18
"19","—I have not.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",19
"20","9671. In what way would you propose to remedy this overcrowding?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",20
"21","—Well, I do not see any possible remedy for it, but that when young men get married, and settle down in their father's lands, they should be removed. I do not see any remedy for it but that.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",21
"22","9672. Have you taken any steps to prevent subdivision of land?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",22
"23","—Yes, I sent word by the ground officer that I would not permit it, but they did not care much for that.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",23
"24","9673. And so the population has gone on increasing?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",24
"25","—Yes.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",25
"26","9674. Now, with this increase of population, have you observed there has been any increase of poverty?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",26
"27","—Well, no, because from having given them so much additional land since I came into possession, I think their condition has been rather improving; but I daresay they are pretty well crowded now, and will continue to be more so.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",27
"28","9675. Have they obtained any new means of support within your recollection?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",28
"29","—The fishing is the only industry there.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",29
"30","9676. Has the fishing not deteriorated too?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",30
"31","—I cannot say it has. I think if the people had piers, and better boats and material, they would",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",31
"32","prosecute the fishing very successfully.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",32
"33","9677. We have been told in more than one place that the fish have to a certain extent disappeared, both herring and cod and ling. Don't you think that is the case?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",33
"34","—I don't think so. This last year was not a favourable year for fishing, but the year before I have known a boat's crew—I think one family —who got 200 crans of herring in about twenty days, which I don't think bad.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",34
"35","9678. The herring fishing at home is a more or less precarious fishing?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",35
"36","—It is.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",36
"37","9679. But the cod and ling fishing is much the same year by year?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",37
"38","—Very much the same.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",38
"39","9680. Do you think that has fallen off at all?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",39
"40","—I do not think it has.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",40
"41","9681. Do the people make much of that now-a-days?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",41
"42","—No, they do not. They salt the fish themselves, and send it to the Glasgow market.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",42
"43","9682. Do you think they might catch and salt more fish?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",43
"44","—I think they might, had they boats and proper material and piers. It is a very great labour, because they have to haul the boats up on the beach immediately they come on shore, and if they had piers they would just fasten the boats alongside the pier till they went out again.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",44
"45","9683. What is the population of your property?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",45
"46","—About 1020, I think.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",46
"47","9684. Are there many points on the property where it would be necessary to have piers?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",47
"48","—I think there are four very suitable places.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",48
"49","9685. But would you require a pier at each of these places to suit the wants of the 1020 people?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",49
"50","—The people are located on both sides of the points.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",50
"51","9686. Would they require two piers on each side?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",51
"52","—On each side.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",52
"53","9687. Would one pier on each side not answer the purpose?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",53
"54","—Not well, because the townships are separated on both sides.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",54
"55","9688. What would be the cost of erecting piers that would suit the people?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",55
"56","—-I should think from £800 to £1000 each pier.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",56
"57","9689. That would be a very considerable outlay for a population of 1020. Unless there was some certainty that they would be able to make a good living off the fishing, would it not be a very large outlay to make?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",57
"58","—Well, the British Fisheries Society had part of those lands at one time, and they built a small village, which you may have observed the other day. They erected a pier there at a cost of £2000, thinking it would pay; but I do not think the fishing is very well conducted there.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",58
"59","9690. It was not a success ?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",59
"60","—No; in fact, there were only ten or twelve crofters there altogether at the time, and now there are thirty-two. That is in the immediate neighbourhood of the pier at the village of Stein. That pier was destroyed.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",60
"61","9691. And you think, notwithstanding the want of success which attended the establishment of this village of Stein, if the people had proper piers and nets and boats, they might make a good living by fishing?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",61
"62","—I think so.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",62
"63","9692. At home?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",63
"64","—I think so.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",64
"65","9693. Do you say you think the people have not got much poorer or much richer in your time ?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",65
"66","—I think they are very much better circumstanced that when I first knew them.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",66
"67","9694. In what respect?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",67
"68","—Better clad and better fed.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",68
"69","9695. Are they better housed?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",69
"70","—Well, they are very careless about their houses. I induced some of them to build a middle wall with a chimney in it, but they would not follow it. I got one or two of them to do it, and I went to see how they were getting on. When I went in I found the fire in the centre of the house, which they prefer, because they say they can get round it.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",70
"71","9696. But their clothing and food have improved?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",71
"72","—Yes.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",72
"73","9697. How is it that they have been enabled to purchase better food and clothing?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",73
"74","—Well, the value of stock has gone up very much since my early recollection. I remember stirks used to sell for £ 1 and 30s., and now they get £ 5 for them.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",74
"75","9698. What is the age of the animal?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",75
"76","—One-year-old.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",76
"77","9699. What is the price of a two-year-old?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",77
"78","—£7 or £8, and £ 10 or £12 for a cow. I remember when cows used to sell for 50s. or £3.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",78
"79","9700. Are there any natural processes at work by which you think the condition of the people will goon improving, their food getting better, and their clothing better?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",79
"80","—I don't know about that, because I believe the people now are overcrowded.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",80
"81","9701. Do you see any way of reducing this pressure of population?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",81
"82","—I think the crofter system altogether is a very bad one. I think that a crofter, to enable him to live at all, should have at least £ 30 worth of laud.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",82
"83","9702. But that is not possible in the present state of things?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",83
"84","—It is not possible at present.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",84
"85","9703. How do you propose to give him £30 worth of land ?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",85
"86","—I don't know unless some of them were assisted to emigrate.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",86
"87","9704. But if a good scheme of emigration were provided under which these arrangements were all satisfactorily made, do you think they would be then inclined to emigrate?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",87
"88","—I think many would.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",88
"89","9705. They complain not only of the smallness of their holdings, but of the want of certainty of tenure. Do you think it would be desirable to give them leases or confer upon them anything like fixity of tenure?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",89
"90","—I think it would be the very worst thing that could possibly be done, fixity of tenure; at least it would tell very badly on the considerate landlord and the man who allowed his tenants to increase and settle down till they were overcrowded. Fixity of tenure would fix them there as miserable poor creatures, who could not benefit themselves in any way. It certainly would be a good thing where the tenants were not crowded, but where they were crowded I think it would work very badly indeed.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",90
"91","9706. Do you think it is a measure which should be deferred till the numbers of the people were reduced?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",91
"92","—Exactly so.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",92
"93","9707. With regard to security and raising of rent, they complain that if they make improvements, their rents are apt to be raised. Do you think that that acts as an impediment to the making of  improvements, the fear of having their rents raised ?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",93
"94","—Well, no doubt in some cases it will do so. But I should be inclined to raise the rent of the man who did not improve, and let the man who improved have the benefit of his improvements.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",94
"95","9708. Do you think it would be desirable to give legal protection to the man who made improvements?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",95
"96","—I think so.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",96
"97","9709. That he should be allowed compensation in some form or other ?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",97
"98","—Certainly.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",98
"99","9710. Would you make it a saleable right?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",99
"100","—Well, I think it ought to be.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",100
"101","9711. The Chairman.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",101
"102","—You stated that you had given up about 1500 acres for the improvement of the crofterslands?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",102
"103","—Well, I fancy it would be for their improvement. I stated that I had given them 1500 acres in addition to what they had when I entered into possession.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",103
"104","9712. In whose occupancy were these 1500 acres?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",104
"105","—In my own.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",105
"106","9713. Is it all in the form of hill pasture, or is part arable?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",106
"107","—Part arable, but the greater part hill pasture.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",107
"108","9714. Have you in that way constituted new crofts, or have you added these acres to existing crofts?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",108
"109","—It is just a separate part of the district where there were no crofts before in the neighbourhood.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",109
"110","9715. And on these you have settled others?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",110
"111","—Yes.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",111
"112","9716. May I ask what is the whole area of your property occupied by crofters?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",112
"113","—About 4500 or 5000 acres.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",113
"114","9717. How much is occupied by yourself?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",114
"115","—About 5000 acres.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",115
"116","9718. How much is occupied by large tenants?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",116
"117","—None; I have no large tenants.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",117
"118","9719. So your property is nearly equally shared between yourself and the crofters?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",118
"119","—Quite so.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",119
"120","9720. Do you think that, without inflicting any serious damage upon the property occupied by yourself, you could still enlarge the boundaries of the crofters?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",120
"121","—I would not be inclined, while the present system exists, to give them any more land, because it would only be a question of time when they would become overcrowded, whatever quantity of land I gave them. But if the system was improved, I would be glad to do anything I could to assist them.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",121
"122","9721. What improvement do you refer to?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",122
"123","—To provide against overcrowding and marrying down two or three families upon one croft. I may",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",123
"124","state a case on this land which I have given off to the crofters. Since I entered into possession I gave one man a croft of about ten acres. He pays about £9 of rent. He has now two sons married upon that",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",124
"125","ground along with himself. So this croft must support three families instead of one. There is no use giving them extension of land, if that eystem goes on.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",125
"126","9722. But if you could be protected against the evils of subdivision you would be inclined to create new crofts?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",126
"127","—I would.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",127
"128","9723. And you think you would be able in that way to derive as good rental as you do from farming yourself or from having a large farm?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",128
"129","—I do not think they pay so well as a large farm does.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",129
"130","9724. If you wished at this moment to let the land which you now occupy yourself in the shape of a large farm would you have a difficulty or not in finding a tenant?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",130
"131","—I would have no difficulty.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",131
"132","9725. At a fair rent?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",132
"133","—At a fair rent. ",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",133
"134","9726. How would you propose to protect yourself against the evils of subdivision? One person who was before us said he thought there ought to be a legislative enactment against subdivision?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",134
"135","—That, I fancy, would be necessary, because I do not think it could be done in any other way.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",135
"136","9727. In fact, you do not think that any proprietor is sufficiently stubborn and hard-hearted to resist their claims?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",136
"137","—Well, I do not think they will be advised by any landlord. They just carry out that system, and it",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",137
"138","works very badly.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",138
"139","9728. Have you found that upon the ground farmed by yourself there is any deterioration of the productive qualities of the soil, or do you find the soil as productive as when you began?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",139
"140","—The climate is very much against us here. We have a very bad climate, and that tells very much",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",140
"141","against the crops.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",141
"142","9729. Do you think the land farmed by the crofters has become deteriorated by constant cropping?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",142
"143","—I think so.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",143
"144","9730. Is it worse than when you first recollect it?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",144
"145","—I think it is.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",145
"146","9731. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",146
"147","—Is the climate getting worse?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",147
"148","—I think so. I remember in my early days we used to have heavy falls of snow in winter, which we have not now.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",148
"149","9732. And you think that would help it?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",149
"150","—I think so.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",150
"151","9733. You mentioned that the price of a cow at Waternish was something like £ 10 or £12 ?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",151
"152","—Yes.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",152
"153","9734. Taking that township of Hallistra which we saw the other day, with a lot of very miserable-looking beasts upon it, do you think that anybody would give £ 10 or £12 for any cow upon the crofts of Hallistra?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",153
"154","—I know a cow in Hallistra that was bought for £14. I may add that all cows look miserable at present, for it has been a severe winter, and the people lost their crop, and the cows were starving.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",154
"155","9735. Have you done anything in the way of which Mr Stewart, Duntulm, spoke, to improve the breed of cattle?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",155
"156","—A good deal.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",156
"157","9736. For the benefit of the crofters?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",157
"158","—A good deal. They get improved stock from me at all times.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",158
"159","9737. Do you know all the people on your estate?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",159
"160","—All.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",160
"161","9738. And you are a constant resident?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",161
"162","—Yes.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",162
"163","9739. You do not prohibit cattle dealers from coming to buy from your crofters?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",163
"164","—No.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",164
"165","9740. Or anybody upon your estate?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",165
"166","—No.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",166
"167","9741. We have heard a good deal stated to-day to the effect that farming is very unprofitable. Do you find it so in your own experience?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",167
"168","—It was very unfavourable this last year.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",168
"169","9742. That applies more to crop, does it not?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",169
"170","—Yes.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",170
"171","9743. But cattle, I presume, are much the same?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",171
"172","—Cattle are rather improved.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",172
"173","9744. Is your stock a mixed stock of cattle and sheep?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",173
"174","—Yes; Highland cattle and sheep.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",174
"175","9745. Which do you depend upon most, the cattle or the sheep?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",175
"176","—Well, the sheep are easier managed. The black cattle are very expensive to keep, particularly in a bad winter; they require a good deal of handfeeding.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",176
"177","9746. Mr Stewart stated that he was in favour of going back a good deal to the old system of having cattle in Skye more than sheep. Do you concur in that, or do you not ?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",177
"178","— If we had a better climate, I think he is right; but with this climate it would be very expensive to rear sufficient food for them. Sheep require little or no hand-feeding, but cattle do.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",178
"179","9747. Do you go out boating a great deal?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",179
"180","—Yes.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",180
"181","9748. Is it consistent with your observation that there are valuable fish ings about your coasts?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",181
"182","—I believe so.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",182
"183","9749. You do not think these are falling off?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",183
"184","—No, I do not think the cod and ling fishing is falling off. The herring fishing is, because, I think, of the Stornoway fishing.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",184
"185","9750. But you desire apparently larger boats and protection in the form of piers?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",185
"186","—Yes.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",186
"187","9751. You think these two things would very much benefit your crofting population?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",187
"188","—I think so.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",188
"189","9752. The Chairman.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",189
"190","—At what age do the crofters generally sell their cattle?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",190
"191","—They generally sell them at one-year-old, for this reason, that they have not sufficient land to keep them; but it would be to the advantage of the crofter if he could keep his stirk, and not sell it until it was older.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",191
"192","9753. As regards their sheep, do they sell the lambs?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",192
"193","—Some sell their wedder lambs ; some keep them till they are three-year-old wedders.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",193

"227","—I do.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",227
"228","9770. I suppose you are acquainted with everybody upon your estate?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",228
"229","—Yes.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",229

"244","9778. Have you made any considerable increase on their rents?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",244
"245","—No; I have not raised their rents one farthing. I do not think their rents have been raised for forty years, and you may understand that their condition must be improved to a considerable extent, because forty years ago the price of a stirk was £ 1 or 30s., and now it is £5.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",245
"246","9779. Do you think they are better òr worse off in respect of food, clothing, education, and everything else, in their social condition, than they were when you came into possession of the property?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",246

"268","9790. Do you consider that an improvement or the reverse?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",268
"269","—I must say I like to hear them sing a song. I remember, when they used to manufacture kelp, it was pretty in the evening to hear them crossing in their boats and singing songs as they rowed along.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",269
"270","9791. And they used to sing songs when reaping the harvest?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",270

"276","9794. Do they impress people with the idea that all such amusements and songs are profane, and should rather be avoided than otherwise?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",276
"277","—I don't think that. It is the abuse of these things that they complain of.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",277
"278","9795. Do you think they were abused?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",278
"279","—I think they were, sometimes. Young men, when they sang songs of that kind, might be found carrying a bottle of whisky in their pocket, or something of that sort, and thus I daresay these amusements were abused.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",279
"280","9796. Do you think there is more or less whisky drunk now than there was forty years ago?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",280
"281","—A great deal more, I am sorry to say. I believe that at the small inn in the village of Stein there is nearly as much whisky consumed as the value of the whole rent they pay to me.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",281

"286","9799. That is the only inn on your property ?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",286
"287","—The only inn.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",287
"288","9800. The Chairman.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",288
"289","—Has there not been a reaction of late years? Has the present temperance movement not reached the place ?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",289
"290","—I cannot say it has. The clergyman of the parish did something in that way, but I do not think he was very successful.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",290
"291","9801. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",291
"292","—Has that inn been always there?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",292
"293","—So far as I remember it always has.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",293
"294","9802. Is it required by the local circumstances, or is it more for strangers ?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",294
"295","—It is to a certain extent required because of the steamer calling there, and people landing from the.steamer and going by the steamer.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",295
"296","9803. Then you do not see your way to remove it ?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",296
"297","—Not very well. I daresay there would be complaints if it were removed. Still it is no advantage to the district.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",297
"298","9804. Where is the nearest one to it ?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",298
"299","—At Dunvegan or Edinbane.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",299
"300","9805. Do you think the people themselves are sensible of the disadvantages of the inn in the way of temptation ?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",300
"301","—No doubt the heads of families are, but the young people are not sensible of them.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",301
"302","9806. Do you think, if there was any form of local option, the people would be inclined to vote it down?",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",302
"303","—I believe they would.",170,"Capt Allan Macdonald","Skye, Portree",303
