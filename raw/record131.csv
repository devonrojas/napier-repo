Some of our people cannot come home to see their families through the poverty of the place, having to remain away in the south country, earning their subsistence; and when they do come home they cannot remain longer than about a month or six weeks, and they have to go.

"139","—Each one cuts where it is most suitable for him—where he pleases.",131,"Peter Macdonald","Skye, Glendale",139
