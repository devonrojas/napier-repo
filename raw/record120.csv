"1","ALEXANDER M'CASKILL, Cottar and Boatman, Soay (53)—examined. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",1
"2","6269. The Chairman.",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected by the people of Soay ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",3
"4","—Yes, among the rest. There are four or five of us. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",4
"5","6270. Have you got a statement to make on the part of the people of Soay ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",5
"6","— Yes : my grandfather went to the army—at least he was forced to go—and his bones are bleaching on a West Indian island. My father served in the militia as long as there was service. My brothers served about fifteen years in H.M. Navy, and now the grandson is evicted to a rock or island that is not inhabited. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",6
"7","6271. That is the case of your particular family, but I want you to speak first on behalf of those who elected you. What is the complaint that the people who live in this island generally make ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",7
"8","—They are paying £3 for the croft and the grazing of a cow. At first the agreement was that we were to have four milk goats and followers. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",8
"9","6272. What was the original summing of the croft ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",9
"10","—Four milk goats and one cow. ""We had ten sheep and a horse, but no horse can stand upon it.",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",10
"11","6273. What is the rent you pay for that ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",11
"12","—£3. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",12
"13","6274. What happened after that ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",13
"14","—The next farmer that came began to reduce us. He took the sheep altogether. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",14
"15","6275. Who was he?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",15
"16","—Hugh. M'Askill",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",16
"17","6276. What reduction did he make ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",17
"18","—He was taking them in by degrees. He had a battle about taking them, because we were not willing to let them go. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",18
"19","6277. Did he reduce the rent?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",19
"20","—Not a farthing. He raised the rent upon us another pound, and summoned my father for being disobedient, because he would not sign this agreement. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",20
"21","6278. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",21
"22","—He took him into court ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",22
"23","—He took him before the sheriff. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",23
"24","6279. The Chairman.",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",24
"25","—What next ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",25
"26","—Well, we were that way till he died. Then the present master came- He reduced that £1 of rent. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",26
"27","6280. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",27
"28","—What is the name of your present master ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",28
"29","—Mr Cameron of Glenbrittle. Then, next year, going on at that rate, I went over to see Mr Cameron about the accounting, if there was anything due, and instead of the £5,? was charged £6 again. I am paying ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",29
"30","also £2 for the grazing of a cow. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",30
"31","6281. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",31
"32","—An extra charge ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",32
"33","—Yes; I said I would not do it as long as the sun shines upon me. My order was ' you will be evicted.' So when the proper time came I went over to appear before the sheriff, and I met Mr Cameron. Well, Mr Cameron told me to return, and that he would reduce the rents —that it was his manager's fault that did it ; but I said —-why, in the name of Heaven, was my brother, that was incurable for twenty-five years, evicted, and my sister was attending upon him, unless it was that he was asking some relief from the parochial board. Glenbrittle told me it was the factor in Talisker's establishment that did that, as he would not go to that royal establishment for the poor. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",33
"34","6282. The Chairman.",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",34
"35","—Were your brother and sister living with you ? ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",35
"36","—Yes. He was incurable for twenty-five years. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",36
"37","6283. Living in your house?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",37
"38","—Yes, and I kept him all since that time. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",38
"39","6284. What happened next? Did you arrange matters?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",39
"40","—I arranged to stop it then. It went no further, and we are that way still. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",40
"41","6285. How many families are there living on the island ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",41
"42","—There are twenty-three families on the island. In the time of the former proprietor,—Rhu,—there were two crofts. I forgot to say that Mr Cameron made his cottar build his house on my croft for five years, and all the crop that grew on it during that time was 5s. worth. He had two cows and a sheep, and a lot of poultry, and it would take a good man to keep them out. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",42
"43","6286. Is that changed now ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",43
"44","—Yes, he has his father's croft now. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",44
"45","6287. You say there are twenty-three families. ""What kind of crofts have they generally got ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",45
"46","—Some of them are bogs and rocks, heather and fern; that is all. There are portions of it where, if I would throw a pail of sea-ware off my back you would suppose you were standing at the foot of Mount Etna—it would shake as long as there was bog to shake. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",46
"47","6288. Has there been no drainage done ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",47
"48","—Baron Rothschild's money could not drain it. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",48
"49","6289. If the crofts are so bad, what ought to be done ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",49
"50","—To remove the inhabitants out of the island altogether. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",50
"51","6290. What use would you make of the island after that ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",51
"52","—I would take 100 acres of a farm at the same rent as the present factor is paying for it, stock it, and build a house. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",52
"53","6291. You would make a farm of the island ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",53
"54","—No, it is quite impossible. I mean I would take a farm on. the mainland. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",54
"55","6292. But what would you do with the twenty three families?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",55
"56","—Do the same with those who were able to take it, and let the rest die. There is no relief for them unless they go to the poorhouse. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",56
"57","6293. Perhaps they would rather stay on the island?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",57
"58","—They will die on the island. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",58
"59","6294. Is there any fishing ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",59
"60","—We live by fishing. Every cent, we get is by fishing, and by the sea. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",60
"61","6295. Is there a harbour?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",61
"62","—There is a creek, but the entrance is dry at low water. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",62
"63","6296. Is it a good station for fishing ? Is it well situated for fishing ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",63
"64","—It is not good for ling, but for herring. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",64
"65","6297. Would there be any use in building a harbour and improving it for the sake of the fishing ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",65
"66","—There is a bay on the south side, if there was a pier there, but this wee harbour that is in it might be cleared and made a fine harbour for boats. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",66
"67","6298. Do the people generally complain of the amount of their rents? ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",67
"68","—There is not a word but that. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",68
"69","6299. Mr Cameron.",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",69
"70","—I think you were going to tell us what you would like to do yourself, if you got away from the island ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",70
"71","—I would have 100 acres of a farm at the present rent that is paid. I suppose it is not paying above Is. per acre. I would have 100 or 150 acres. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",71
"72","6300. On which farm ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",72
"73","—Any of the farms—I don't care which; but let me get arable land where I will get to that croft from the sea with my boat. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",73
"74","6301. Which farm would suit you best ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",74
"75","—They tell me that our former minister said he saw oat crop growing in Glen Bracadale, and that he never saw better growing in the Lothians. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",75
"76","6302. How is that land occupied now, and what is the rent of it ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",76
"77","— Just outside where you are standing and down the farm here. That is what I was told. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",77
"78","6303. Then with regard to these twenty-two other families, you don't really mean they are to remain and die on the island, but what do you suggest should be done with them ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",78
"79","—Every one who can take that measure let them take it, because there are a lot willing to do it.  ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",79
"80","6304. How many of the twenty-two would be willing to do it ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",80
"81","—I don't know ; I never asked them. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",81
"82","6305. But you know their circumstances?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",82
"83","—I know their circumstances. I know they were for a fortnight this year living on shell-fish, and I know there were three families whose only subsistence for a week was the carcass of a stirk that died. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",83
"84","6306. That is very distressing to hear, but would it not make it still more heavy for those people to take farms of 100 acres and 150 acres?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",84
"85","— Surely, but if they would get 60 acres and pay £3 for it, it would do them well, and let them get fixity and tenure, so that no landlord or factor could put them out—only Her Majesty. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",85
"86","6307. But according to you, they have too much fixity and tenure on this island. The island is so bad they don't require much fixity?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",86
"87","— No, but where they are going. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",87
"88","6308. What stock would they require—taking even a smaller holding than 60 acres?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",88
"89","—I don't know. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",89
"90","6309. Assuming that the farm of Glenbrittle is out of lease next year, can you suggest any mode by which the land of Glenbrittle might be utilised without any great loss accruing to the landlord, and by which not only those twenty-three families, but many other families in this parish might be benefited, and get a share of it ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",90
"91","—I don't suppose the landlord would be a whit the worse of the poor crofters having 60 or 100 acres than he has by giving it to big sheep farmers. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",91
"92","6310. That is your opinion?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",92
"93","—That is my opinion, and a good opinion too. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",93
"94","6311. Can you suggest how it could be done?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",94
"95","—Just give it to one that is able to take it. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",95
"96","6312. What is to be done with the sheep on the farm? Who is to buy them ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",96
"97","—The proprietor. He is bound to take the stock. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",97
"98","6313. What would he do with them ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",98
"99","—Sell them. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",99
"100","6314. How is the stock to be put on the ground to replace that stock ? ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",100
"101","— We will do the best ourselves. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",101
"102","6315. How would you pay the rent if you had no stock?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",102
"103","—That is my own secret. With regard to my croft, I cannot take the wintering of a cow upon it. There is not a blade of grass growing there, and it is so soft I must put sea-manure upon it. There is not a blade that a scythe could reach without that. When I sow a bushel of oats, it would not be difficult to count how many blades would come out of it. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",103
"104","6316. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",104
"105","—Has the big tenant stock on the island? ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",105
"106","—The man that was there before laid them on my crop, and in spite of my neck he just plundered my crop with sheep. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",106
"107","6317. How many sheep has he on just now?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",107
"108","—There are about 400 or 500 hoggs wintering off my lot. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",108
"109","6318. Suppose the big farmer were removed altogether, and that you had the island—the twenty-three families of you paying rent to the landlord—would that benefit your circumstances ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",109
"110","—It would not in the least, because there is no possibility of keeping cattle when you cannot grow corn. It would pay a sheep farmer very well to have the grazing of it. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",110
"111","6319. Then I distinctly understand from you that you want to be removed to the mainland ?-",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",111
"112","—We want to be removed. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",112
"113","6320. Have you been there for a very long time?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",113
"114","—I have been there, in and out, since I was born. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",114
"115","6321. Have all the twenty-three families been there a long time, and their predecessors?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",115
"116","—It is ourselves that went first into it, before there was a wholesale eviction by M'Caskill of Rhu. He took three or four of my grandfathers and granduncles and smuggled them away. Whoever would not pay £1 0 to him, he would leave them helpless. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",116
"117","6322. Sixty years ago, before the evictions began, how many families would be upon Soay ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",117
"118","—There was only a herd, so far as I know. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",118
"119","6323. Then was it in consequence of the clearing out of the people from the mainland that they were glad to come to this place to get a home?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",119
"120","—Exactly. It was not good enough for sheep. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",120
"121","6324. And now you want to revert to what it was before",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",121
"122","—that there should be only one herd upon it ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",122
"123","—I want to have nothing to do with the island. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",123
"124","6325. Not even a herd for the sheep?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",124
"125","—What would he herd? It could not afford sustenance for all the families. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",125
"126","6326. But you would not like that it should be left so that nobody lived on it but a herd for the sheep?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",126
"127","—I would not care although they should remove it into the sea. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",127
"128","6327. Have you applied to M'Leod with reference to the circumstances of the people of the island ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",128
"129","—If I would open my mouth I would be sure to have my teeth drawn. After I did a year's work for the other man he would pay me with a boll of meal and a pound ; and he told the proprietor to give us meal, and when I went I had to pay £5, Os. for a brother of mine who had got a boll of meal, and was dead on his croft. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",129
"130","6328. Things are getting worse with you ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",130
"131","—Worse every day. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",131
"132","6329. Have you and your co-tenants within the last two or three years not considered it worth your while to make a representation to the laird to benefit your circumstances, by giving you a place on the mainland ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",132
"133","— No, we knew well enough it was of no avail, and unless Her Majesty will do it he will not do it. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",133
"134","6330. That is your firm opinion ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",134
"135","—I am certain sure of it, as sure as I have to meet my death. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",135
"136","6331. Sheriff Nicolson.",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",136
"137","—Have you a church at Soay ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",137
"138","—Yes. There was an old church over at the island which was destroyed. We took a piece of the old pulpit and one or two pews. The proprietor belonged to the Established Church, and he sent us to Portree. I went there, lost two days, and was sent to Edinburgh, and the authorities there were so kind to us that we were not out of lodgings till we came home. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",138
"139","6332. You mean the Galton Jail ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",139
"140","—Yes. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",140
"141","6333. Have you a minister living at Soay ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",141
"142","—Not one. We did not see a minister these five months back. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",142
"143","6334. Where is the nearest church ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",143
"144","—Bracadale. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",144
"145","6335. That is your parish church ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",145
"146","—Yes. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",146
"147","6336. Then you would need balloons to go to church ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",147
"148","—Yes, or give us the ' Lively,' and we will go. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",148
"149","6337. You have a schoolhouse ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",149
"150","—Yes. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",150
"151","6338. Are the children attending pretty well ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",151
"152","—Yes. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",152
"153","6339. Where is the nearest doctor to you ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",153
"154","—Carabost, and the nearest post-office is at Carabost. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",154
"155","6340. It is a day's journey from Soay to Carabost ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",155
"156","—Yes. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",156
"157","6341. Have you any paupers on the island ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",157
"158","—Yes. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",158
"159","6342. Where does the inspector of poor live ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",159
"160","—At Carabost. He was two or three times this year at us: but I daresay it was two or three years before he was there before. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",160
"161","6343. There is a story about a number of people having been kidnapped, or induced to remove from Soay and other places in Minginish long ago ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",161
"162","—I know it well. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",162
"163","6344. How long ago was it ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",163
"164","—It is seventy years ago since my grandfather went, and it was before that. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",164
"165","6345. There were a lot induced to emigrate to Canada ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",165
"166","—They took them away in spite of themselves. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",166
"167","6346. And they were not taken to Canada ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",167
"168","—No, it was to Charlestown, where they were sold for slaves. He left them poor enough and robbed the clothes off their backs, before they came back to the same farm again. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",168
"169","6347. Who did that ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",169
"170","—Old Kenneth M'Askill. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",170
"171","6348. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",171
"172","—Of the farm of Rhu Dunan ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",172
"173","—Yes. I've heard news from people who went to America. Many of them say they would rather be home in their native place yet, if they were the way they were before. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",173
"174","6349. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",174
"175","—How many people are in the island ?",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",175
"176","— About one hundred. ",120,"Alexander Mccaskill","Skye, Bracadale",176
