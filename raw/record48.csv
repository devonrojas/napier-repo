"1","NORMAN MUNRO, Catechist, Clachan (69)—examined. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",1
"2","2806. The Chairman.",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",2
"3","—Have you a croft ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",3
"4","—No. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",4
"5","2807. Was your family a crofting family ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",5
"6","—Yes, but not in this country.",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",6
"7","2808. From what country do you come ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",7
"8","—M'Leod's country",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",8
"9","—Colbost.",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",9
"10","2809 How long have you been in your present employment ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",10
"11","—Eight years. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",11
"12","2810. Where were you employed before that?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",12
"13","—I was employed as a tradesman in the low country. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",13
"14","2811. Since you came here eight years ago, have you observed any change in the condition of the people ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",14
"15","—Yes, certain. I remarked that they are a deal poorer since the day when I came here. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",15
"16","2812. In what respect do you see the change chiefly?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",16
"17","—In so far as their lands are not yielding maintenance for the people. That is one cause. And that land has been tilled perhaps forty or fifty years, and it cannot be expected it will yield crops to support the people who are living upon it. Another cause, that is evidently the case, which was often spoken of to-day, is the high rents we paid for these lands. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",17
"18","2813. Have you observed a change of feeling and disposition on the part of the people connected with the deterioration of their condition ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",18
"19","—Well, I cannot remark anything regarding that, only that they complain of poverty. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",19
"20","2814. What do you think should be done?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",20
"21","—If they would get more land, and cheaper, to keep them in employment and work in the country, without running from place to place after the bite they had to get to support their families, they would be better off. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",21
"22","2815. Do you think that the custom of going away for several months in the year to different places, and looking after employment, has a bad effect upon the happiness and character of the majority of the people ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",22
"23","— Well, there is no doubt but that might be the case, for since that began in the country there is a difference of feeling in that respect from what it was in my young days. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",23
"24","2816. You think that if the men remained at home with their wives and children, and gained their subsistence at home, they would be happier and better?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",24
"25","—I am certain of it. If they had lands to cultivate, and keep themselves and their families at work at home, and land that would support them, with cheap rents, such as would keep a family, I believe they would be far better off than running to the low country every now and again. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",25
"26","2817. But the young men, could they not often better their condition by going to other parts of Scotland, or by going to the colonies ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",26
"27","—Well, I think they would be as happy at home as in any of the colonies in the world. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",27
"28","2818. But suppose all the young people remained at home and married and had families in the country, would not the land be subdivided again, and the people become poorer and poorer?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",28
"29","—Give them the opportunity to work it out, and if the land was overcrowded with more than it could support, send them away to the colonies. I think they should get what lands are lying waste, and the best lands, in the meantime. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",29
"30","2819. But suppose you allow them to multiply to that extent, and subdivide that land, it would be more difficult then to send them away. There would be greater numbers, and by that time the land in the colonies would be filled up, and would they not find it difficult to get a living there?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",30
"31","— Well, that is a question that is very ill to answer. I believe there is plenty of land, if it were only subdivided among the people, that would support them in the meantime. If that were done just now, we might just look to what is coming afterwards. I do not see that the meantime has anything to do with what is to come. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",31
"32","2820. But would it not be better to provide some of the people with more land here, and allow others to go away, and so to use every means of improving the people ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",32
"33","—Well, if you give them the land, and divide it rightly, I have no objection to that. I think that is very right, when it is done. But had not I a good right to that land for which my forefathers suffered death in wars, protecting the country ] Who should have a better right to that land than the heirs living in it, although it is wasted with sheep and game and deer altogether] For instance, my uncle was brought out of his bed to go and defend this country, and at the same time my grandfather was provided with a piece of laud that would support his family, and at a very low rent. Now, in a very short period after that he was removed from that, and the land sold, and my people sent abroad if they liked to go. And have not I a good right to claim that land now as the heir of my friend that suffered ? ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",33
"34","2821. Sheriff Nicolson.",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",34
"35","—Where were they removed from",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",35
"36","—From Colbost. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",36
"37","2822. The Chairman.",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",37
"38","—How was your uncle taken for the defence of his country?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",38
"39","—He was taken by the laird, M'Leod of M'Leod, and when they were done, he got the promise ; but not only that, he was removed from a different place for choice of land for the son at the time. I think the offspring had a good claim on these lands to get them. I am well aware that is partly what has done a little disturbance in the island-claiming such claims on the land. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",39
"40","2823. Sheriff Nicolson.",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",40
"41","—In respect of what their fathers did for the country ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",41
"42","—Yes, thinking they had a better right to it than strangers had, or even to be put under sheep. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",42
"43","2824. Do you know of any man from this district in the army just now?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",43
"44","—I am not so well aware of that, but there are some here who may perhaps know it. I know some in our own country, M'Leod's country, in the army. There are one or two from here,-I believe, in the army whom I saw at home once. Another thing that is very miserable in this place, is the women working the work of horses at the time of owing and delving their croft",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",44
"45","2825. The Chairman.",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",45
"46","—-Do you think that in former times, when the crofts were larger, there was less work on the part of women in the fields than there is now ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",46
"47","—I am certain of it, because they had horses to help them. I never saw any in my young days—women drawing a harrow— till of late, and I think that is horse work for any woman or man, which is very common now in the islands. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",47
"48","2826. Professor Mackinnon.",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",48
"49","—In the countryside where you were brought up, was it the practice for women to draw the harrow ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",49
"50","—No. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",50
"51","2827. I suppose the cas-chrom was used?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",51
"52","—Yes, but only in places where the plough could not go. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",52
"53","2828. Was the plough more common then than it is now ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",53
"54","—Certainly; the people had horses to plough, but they have not any to plough now, and they must use the cas-chrom. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",54
"55","2829. The Chairman.",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",55
"56","—Do you think the health of the females and the children suffers from having an inferior description of food, and not having so much milk as they used to have ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",56
"57","—That is evident, because in this district I do not believe I saw a pound of butter sold, between Loanfearn and Deig, in eight years, and that is a good proof of the poverty of the country. There might be a little in Loanfearn, but among the crofters I did not hear there was a pound of butter sold in all the district. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",57
"58","2830. Sheriff Nicolson.",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",58
"59","—Was the district where you lived famous for butter and cheese ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",59
"60","—They used to have a good supply to supply themselves and sell to others. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",60
"61","2831. The Chairman.",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",61
"62","—Do you remember that they used to sell butter in former times ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",62
"63","—In my own country, but not here since I came. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",63
"64","2832. Salt butter ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",64
"65","—Yes. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",65
"66","2833. Do the people keep any pigs in this country ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",66
"67","—No, not in this district. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",67
"68","2834. It has never been a custom in the country ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",68
"69","—Well, in my own days I saw the tenants keeping one for their own use; that was all. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",69
"70","2835. But did the crofters ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",70
"71","—Yes. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",71
"72","2836. Why have they ceased to keep swine?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",72
"73","—Because they cannot feed them. That is my idea. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",73
"74","2837. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",74
"75","—They used to feed them on potatoes?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",75
"76","— Yes, and fatten them on com seed when it came to the time of fattening. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",76
"77","2838. The Chairman.",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",77
"78","—Do you think the general conduct and moral character of the people has deteriorated or does it remain the same",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",78
"79","—their honesty, good behaviour, and sobriety?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",79
"80","—Well, that is a very difficult question to answer. So far as I can see, I cannot say anything in regard to that. I think there are people here as honest as I know of in the whole island, if they had the means; and so far as they go, they are now almost ruined in regard to their honesty. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",80
"81","2839. In reference to sobriety, is there more drinking than there used to be in former times, or less ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",81
"82","—-I believe there is less, but there is too much still. There should not be any of it at all. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",82
"83","2840. Is the temperance movement making any progress in this part of the country?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",83
"84","—Yes, a good deal. ",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",84
"85","2841. Is there more education generally now than there was? Has the new system of education done good. Has it been effectual ?",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",85
"86","—That will be the case through time. It is young as yet, but it has done a good deal",48,"Norman Munro","Skye, Stenscholl",86
