"1","MALCOLM M’LEOD, Crofter, Gillen (77)—examined. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",1
"2","(See Appendix A, VII.)",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",2
"3","3473. The Chairman.",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",3
"4","—Have you been freely chosen a delegate?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",4
"5","— Yes. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",5
"6","3474. What statement have you to make on the part of the people of Gillen ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",6
"7","—They are wishing to get enlarged holdings. I do not know how large they would desire, but that they should get some enlargement at any rate. They are very close. Their holdings can only support one cow with justice, but they keep one and a two-year-old. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",7
"8","3475. Have they any common pasture ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",8
"9","—No, but a very small bit at the end of the lots within the fence. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",9
"10","3476. In former times, had they common pasture?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",10
"11","—I was once that I had the whole pasture myself. I was four years in Unish, and I had the hill pasture there. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",11
"12","3477. But at Gillen?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",12
"13","—We have not had hill pasture since I came to Gillen six years ago. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",13
"14","3478. Before that, was there common pasture in old times?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",14
"15","—There were no tenants in Gillen before these. They were previously in Scor for twelve years. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",15
"16","3479. And who was in Gillen before that? Was it a tacksman?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",16
"17","—It was in the hands of the proprietor a long time before. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",17
"18","3480. Sheriff Nicolson.",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",18
"19","—How long is it since you were tenants at Unish?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",19
"20","—It is about thirty-two years since we were cleared from Unish. We were fourteen or fifteen years in the occupancy of Unish, and I myself was four years in Unish to that time. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",20
"21","3481. In whose time were you removed?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",21
"22","—Major M'Donald moved us from Unish, and sent us to Scor. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",22
"23","3482. Who took possession of Unish ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",23
"24","—The proprietor kept it in his own occupancy. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",24
"25","3483. And there are no crofters in Scor now ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",25
"26","—No. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",26
"27","3484. Who removed them ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",27
"28","—The captain, the present proprietor. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",28
"29","3485. The Chairman.",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",29
"30","—Then you, in your lifetime, have been moved twice ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",30
"31","—Yes, three times in alL I am now forty-three years paying rent. I was three years in Trumpan, where I was born. Then I went to Unish, where I remained four years; then twelve years in Scor. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",31
"32","3486. Mr Cameron.",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",32
"33","—Which was the best land in all those places?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",33
"34","— Unish. I was very well off in Unish. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",34
"35","3487. Was there a tacksman at Unish?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",35
"36","—Yes, at that time. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",36
"37","3488. And crofters ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",37
"38","—Yes; there was a Mr M'Rae. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",38
"39","3489. Was there a tacksman at Gillen too, a good while ago ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",39
"40","—Yes, at one time. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",40
"41","3490. Before your time ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",41
"42","—I do not well remember him, but I remember cottars he had in it. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",42
"43","3491. In what way did the land at Unish show its superiority to the other land 1",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",43
"44","—There was large hill pasture connected with it. We could keep cows and sheep and horses. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",44
"45","3492. You have no pasture where you are now ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",45
"46","—No, we have neither sheep nor horses; and buying has spoilt us entirely. The land has become so weak, and will not yield crops, and we cannot manure it. The ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",46
"47","shore is too steep for us to bring the sea-ware from it. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",47
"48","3493 Is any of it capable of improvement?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",48
"49","—It cannot be much improved by working, but if we had a horse we could manure it; we could improve it. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",49
"50","3494. There is no land that would bear trenching?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",50
"51","—No, not that we could trench. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",51
"52","3495. What do you want?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",52
"53","—There is land enough through the country. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",53
"54","3496. But what do you and your neighbours in the township particularly want?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",54
"55","—The one thing they are wanting there is to have their holdings increased, to have hill pasture where they could keep sheep, and that they would be able to keep a horse. If Parliament would advance us money to enable us to stock the land, we would pay it by degrees; but should we have our present holdings for nothing, we would not come on well with them. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",55
"56","3497. Did you ever ask the proprietor if he saw his way to give hill grazing ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",56
"57","—Our landlord was offering us a piece of hill ground when we came to Gillen. We have no fault to find with him. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",57
"58","3498. Why didn't you take it?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",58
"59","—It was dear. Some of us were not for taking it, though others were, and we didn't take it at the time, and could not get it afterwards. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",59
"60","3499. But you could not have been very anxious about it?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",60
"61","—It is not the landlord that left us so poor as we are,",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",61
"62","—at least the present landlord. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",62
"63","3500 How long ago did the landlord offer you this piece of hill ground ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",63
"64","—He was offering us the hill shortly after we came to Gillen. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",64
"65","3501. What rent did he offer the hill at?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",65
"66","—I think it was £25. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",66
"67","3502. What stock was it calculated to keep ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",67
"68","—Not many cattle. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",68
"69","3503. About how many ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",69
"70","—I think it would keep a horse a piece for the eleven tenants. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",70
"71","3504. How many cows?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",71
"72","—I don't think it would support more than a horse a piece to us. It would be bare enough with that itself all the year. It is only a small spot. But the landlord was very favourable to us. Though we should be backward with the rent, he was not hard upon us. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",72
"73","3505. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",73
"74","—The previous witness stated that when you were selling your beasts the ground officer was in the habit of coming once a year and getting the first offer. Is there such a custom ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",74
"75","—Yes. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",75
"76","3506. Supposing then they did not agree as to the price?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",76
"77","—The landlord expects to have the first offer. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",77
"78","3507. What happens if they do not agree ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",78
"79","—If they would not agree about the price, the landlord was letting us sell the beast wherever we could. He was not finding fault with us. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",79
"80","3508. Supposing they did not agree, what happened ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",80
"81","—That we would be at liberty to sell the beast anywhere else. He never said anything worse than Yes and No to us about that. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",81
"82","3509. Is it a fact, or is it not, that you generally did give the beast to the ground officer ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",82
"83","—Yes, and he would be getting them. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",83
"84","3510. Sheriff Nicolson.",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",84
"85","—Does he give as good a price as other people? ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",85
"86","—He is giving a good price this past year too. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",86
"87","3511. Has that been always the custom?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",87
"88","—Yes ; for some time past at any rate. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",88
"89","3512. Professor MacMnnon.",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",89
"90","—And you almost always agreed?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",90
"91","—Sometimes we might be complaining of the price we got from them, but we would agree for all that. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",91
"92","3513. The Chairman.",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",92
"93","—Do the people dislike the ground officer coming round to make this offer ? Would they rather that the ground officer did not do it ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",93
"94","—They would prefer the ground officer to have the beast than anybody else, if he gave a price as good as others, and if he would go pretty near the price they could have got from another, he would get it all the same.",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",94
"95","3514. Is it, on the whole, a convenience to the people that the ground officer should give them the opportunity of selling their beasts to him ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",95
"96","— No, not much. He is buying them these days like anybody else, and he gets them in preference to any other, when he does that. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",96
"97","3515. Mr Cameron.",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",97
"98","—Do the drovers come round here?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",98
"99","—A few. Some of them were here this year already. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",99
"100","3516. Are they very stiff to deal with?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",100
"101","—Yes, they certainly are. ",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",101
"102","3517. Are they more so than the ground officer ?",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",102
"103","—They are as hard to deal with as the ground officer. Any one that comes the way will drive as hard a bargain as possible.",57,"Malcolm Mcleod","Skye, Waternish",103
