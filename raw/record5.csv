"1","NEIL MACPHERSON, Crofter and Fisherman, Gedentailler—examined. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",1
"2","243. The Chairman.",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",2
"3","—Have you been in the room during the examination of other delegates ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",3
"4","—Yes. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",4
"5","244. Have you heard and understood what they said ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",5
"6","—Yes. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",6
"7","245. Do you agree with them?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",7
"8","—I fully agree with all that they said. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",8
"9","246. Is there anything you wish to add to their statement?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",9
"10","—I have to say that during all my recollection ws got no work from the landlord. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",10
"11","247. How long have you been a crofter?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",11
"12","—Upwards of twenty years. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",12
"13","248. The croft has been in your possession about twenty years ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",13
"14","—Yes. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",14
"15","249. What is the rent you pay?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",15
"16","—£3, 13s. for half a lot. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",16
"17","250. What more have you to say in addition to your complaint about not getting work from the landlord?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",17
"18","—To get land, as much as we could make use of. That would do us and our families good. The land which we have got is too shallow. In some places it is not more than one inch in depth, and other parts of it are so rocky that it cannot be called land. We can make no use whatever of it, and we are paying rent for it all the same. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",18
"19","251. Is there any land immediately near your township which would be useful to the crofters if it were given to them ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",19
"20","—Yes, there is such land. There is plenty of land on the farm of Scorrybreck, plenty of land at Tormichaig, plenty at Moll, plenty at Kingsburgh and Skeinish, and Glenvarigil and Corrie. There is plenty of land for every crofter on the estate if they got it. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",20
"21","252. If the land were offered by the landlord to the crofters, would the crofters, in your opinion, be willing and able to take it and make use of it ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",21
"22","—We could not stock it at the present time, we are so poor. We have been obliged to spend our all for food, and we in our township especially are poor because of our having been deprived of the hill pasture, and having no land upon which we could live, and what land we had dear. In some parts when I put down the seed I am obliged to take earth with the spade from other parts to cover the seed.",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",22
"23","253. Sheriff Nicolson",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",23
"24","—Potato seed?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",24
"25","—Potato seed, and oats as well. Even should the landlord order us to put more stock upon our land, what could we do with them ? We could not feed them, unless we would put the one inside the other. When we have to buy food for our families and food for our stock, how could we stand to it, and the stock few? Our holdings on the land were serving no other purpose to us than affording us a home to which we could resort from our fishing,—fishing at Kinsale and the east coast,—where we were earning the wherewith to pay the landlord and feed our families. Some years our fishing would succeed with us, and other years it would not, aud what caused the rents to be so very high in this part of the land was that it was so close to the sea—sea that was open to all the people in England, Ireland, and Scotland as well as us,—and then, oftenest, it was people from those countries who were making better use of the fishings than we were. They wuld have more fishing material than we had. It was their trade. The little bits of land that we had were spoiling us for fishing. W e had to give our time at home to cultivating the land,—land out of which we were taking no good. I see the whole district around us in the same circumstances in which we are, and that they all have their cause of complaint according to their real circumstances, because they have been crowded upon each other, and have no elbow room. The same land that is being tilled by us has been in cultivation, from year to year, since the time of our great-grandfathers. My grandfather was ninety-five, my father eighty-four, and 1 myself have been fifty years here. I remember seeing my grandfather, and I have heard him say that the land which we are now cultivating had been cultivated in his time and before his time. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",25
"26","254. The Chairman.",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",26
"27","—You have stated that the people here are inferior to the east country people as fishers. Can you suggest anything which the Government could do to improve the fishing in this country?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",27
"28","— If we could get assistance from Government to get as good boats as other places have. The fishing will not be about our coasts at all times. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",28
"29","255. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",29
"30","—You mean that at certain times, when there was no fishing here, you would go away to the Irish coast and other places ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",30
"31","—Yes, some of them could do that. If they had better boats and better fishing material they could go elsewhere when the fishing at home failed them. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",31
"32","256. Supposing they had good boats just now they would be in danger of being wrecked, as they have no place to draw them up?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",32
"33","—That would be the case. They would be in danger of being broken. There are some townships about where the boats could be drawn up with safety. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",33
"34","257. The Chairman.",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",34
"35","—Have you anything more to say before you go ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",35
"36","—I have nothing more to say. If we had the land at a fair rent; and besides that I think the land has been sufficiently paid for already—paying rent since the time of our forefathers. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",36
"37","258. Mr Cameron.",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",37
"38","—Do any of your neighbours go away to the mainland of Scotland to get work ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",38
"39","—Plenty of them go to the south country to work. It is by their work in the south country that they are making a living. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",39
"40","259. Do they go as much now as they used to go a few years ago ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",40
"41","— They are now going more to the south than they used to do in days gone by. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",41
"42","260. What is their favourite place to go to?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",42
"43","—Anywhere in which they hear that work is going on. A man who follows the sea, wherever he hears seamen are in demand, goes there, and the man who is up to land work goes wherever he hears there are wages to be earned in that way. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",43
"44","261. Then how many months will he spend away in the year?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",44
"45","—When we go to the east coast fishing we stay away for two months. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",45
"46","262. I am not talking of the fishing, I am talking of those who take to land work ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",46
"47","—Some of them leave the country about this time of the year and will be away until about Martinmas, and others of them stay away till the next spring season comes. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",47
"48","263. They stay away the whole year?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",48
"49","—Yes. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",49
"50","264. Do many of your neighbours go away in that way for a whole year?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",50
"51","—Yes, some of them. I myself have been iti the habit of being away a whole year, ever since I have been able to work. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",51
"52","265. Then how do you come to be here now?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",52
"53","—I mean, after my spring work is done. I am away from home the whole year except the spring time. Last year I stayed at home expecting there would be fishing about, but there was no fishing. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",53
"54","266. Sheriff Nicolson.",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",54
"55","—I believe there is an unusual number of widow women in Gedentailler ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",55
"56","—Yes, there are some poor widows in our township. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",56
"57","267. How many?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",57
"58","—There are six at any rate. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",58
"59","268. How do they happen to be there ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",59
"60","—Through some of their husbands getting drowned at the east coast fishing. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",60
"61","269. Have most of them families?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",61
"62","—They all have families. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",62
"63","270. How do they live?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",63
"64","—They live very poorly; it cannot be otherwise. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",64
"65","271. Have they crofts?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",65
"66","—They have half crofts. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",66
"67","272. Professor Mackinnon.",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",67
"68","—I think you said that the crofts were so bad that you would be better without them ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",68
"69","—Yes, we would be better without them unless we got more land. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",69
"70","273. And that the croft prevented you from prosecuting the fishing?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",70
"71","—Yes; if I have not more land it would be better for me to be at work earning wages than to be hanging about a croft. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",71
"72","274. And what you want is a good croft elsewhere and at a fair rent ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",72
"73","— Yes; what I want is a good croft at a fair rent. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",73
"74","275. What is your stock just now ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",74
"75","—Two cows. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",75
"76","276. What is the summing?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",76
"77","—Two cows and a two-year-old. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",77
"78","277. No sheep?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",78
"79","—Nine or ten sheep. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",79
"80","278. How many have you ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",80
"81","—Seven or eight. I do not know if they are alive to-day, but I think I have that number. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",81
"82","279. Could you stock a good croft ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",82
"83","—No, I could not. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",83
"84","280. How many acres of arable land have you?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",84
"85","—I cannot tell the number of acres, but there is no more than one acre of it arable. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",85
"86","281. How much rent?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",86
"87","—£3, 13s., and my share of the hill pasture of Benlee",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",87
"88","282. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",88
"89","—You said you thought you had paid rent long enough ; do you mean that you think the land should belong to you now ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",89
"90","—Yes, I think the land should belong to ourselves now. ",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",90
"91","283. Were you one of the delegates chosen by the people of the Braes here ?",5,"Neil Macpherson","Skye, Braes",91
