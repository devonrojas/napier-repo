"1","JOHN MACDONALD, Crofter, Opinan (39)—examined.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",1
"2","29446. The Chairman.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",2
"3","—I see you have a statement?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",3
"4","—Yes.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",4
"5","—'We, the undersigned tenants of Sir Kenneth S. Mackenzie, Bart., are very much surprised, grieved, and disappointed, to hear for our own and others sakes that an attempt is proposed to be made in the interest of certain shopkeepers alone, to object to Mr Donald Mackenzie supplying the tenantry with a change of seed oats annually, as he has been kindly doing to our very great benefit for some time past. Were it not for Mr Mackenzie, the one-half of the ground on this property would not be laid down; he is also a public benefactor in various other ways —for instance, he has compelled the meal-dealers to reduce the price of their meal very considerably, while, at the same time, he invariably kept very superior meal, and, whether people had money or not to pay for it, he always supplied them ungrudgingly. Moreover, Mr Mackenzie, for the convenience and great benefit of the Gairloch estate tenantry, kept eight superior bulls, for the use of which he makes a very moderate charge; but at the same time he never objected to the tenants keeping bulls themselves of the right kind, if able and willing to do so. Through his instrumentality the breed of stock has greatly improved, and fetched better prices in the markets than formerly, as we all very well know and appreciate. The Royal Commissioners and the outside public would have heard more of poverty in Gairloch, were it not for the forethought, consideration, and kindness of Mr Mackenzie. Every person interested in the prosperity and well-being of the people of Gairloch would be sorry that anything should be said or done against Mr Mackenzie's transactions, to dissuade him or discourage him in any way.

"7","29447. Who wrote this J",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",7
"8","—A lady belonging to the place was the writer, but we ourselves are the authors of it.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",8
"9","29448. Thirty-six signatures, all made by the people ?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",9
"10","—Yes, these are the genuine signatures of the people.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",10
"11","29449. You never heard any complaint among the tenantry with regard to the dealings of Mr Mackenzie in me?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",11
"12","—No. It is from him I buy my seed oats and guauo. I have taken these things from him as a crofter for the last five years, and if I could get them cheaper anywhere else I would go there.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",12
"13","29450. Have you more confidence in the quality of the seed and the guano, because you get it from the factor for the estate ?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",13
"14","—No, not particularly because it is supplied by the factor, but because it turns out well every year.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",14
"15","29451. But surely you have always got the factor here whom you could reproach if it were not good. Is it not an advantage to have it on the spot ?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",15
"16","—I would take it from the one that I could get it best from, and cheapest.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",16
"17","29452. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",17
"18","—How was it known beforehand that any such statement as that was to be made here to-day ?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",18
"19","—We heard it remarked about a week ago; and we were afraid it might be brought up, and we thought if it were brought up, the effect of it would be that he would cease to supply us.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",19
"20","29453. Would you like to see the business and mercantile transactions in Gairloch under the factor and ground officer ?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",20
"21","—I cannot exactly tell about that, but I know that it is from him that I get my own supplies.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",21
"22","29454. Would you or would you not like to see the mercantile transactions of Gairloch in the hands of the factor?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",22
"23","—It is quite possible that, if it were entirely in the hands of the factor, it might be the worse for us—that is quite possible; but at present there is opposition —and perhaps I may get advantage of it.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",23
"24","29455. Is it not more likely that the fact of business being carried on by the factor and ground officer will kill all opposition than the reverse ?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",24
"25","—That might be, but when there are a good number of merchants, as there are, there is opposition, and we get the advantage; we go to the cheapest man.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",25
"26","29456. The factor, then, is underselling the other merchants ?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",26
"27","—I think he is.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",27
"28","29457. You say in this paper the complaint has been made in the interest of certain shopkeepers alone; who are the shopkeepers ?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",28
"29","—I cannot tell who the traders referred to are, but we heard that traders were complaining that he was injuring their trade, and we did not want that he should be put down because we considered him the better man.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",29
"30","29458. Did any of the traders appear here to-day ?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",30
"31","—Not as delegates, that I am aware of.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",31
"32","29459. What was the meaning of getting up this paper then ?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",32
"33","—The reason of getting up the paper was, that we heard the matter was to be taken up as against the factor to-day, and we thought perhaps the effect of it might be used against him in such a way that he would cease to trade, and we consider him the best trader of them all. For five years I have been taking supplies from the same man, and I would not get credit from another man.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",33
"34","29460. By whom was it supposed that the matter would be taken up against the factor since no delegate from the shopkeepers has appeared?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",34
"35","—I cannot name any man who wan to have taken up the matter to-day. We were told the matter was to be taken up in the interests of the local merchants.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",35
"36","29461. Have the local merchants no right to make a complaint?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",36
"37","—Yes, and they have the right to make it here.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",37
"38","29462. Have they done so to-day?",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",38
"39","—I did not hear it.",496,"John Macdonald","Ross-shire, Poolewe",39
