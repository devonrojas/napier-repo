"2","3088. The Chairman.",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",2
"3","—Are you a fisherman?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",3
"4","—I am not now a fisherman ; I was a fisherman. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",4
"5","3089. How long have you been on your present croft ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",5
"6","—Forty-five or forty-six years. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",6
"7","3090. Have you been freely elected a delegate by the people of your place ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",7
"8","—Yes. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",8
"9","3091. What have you to state to us on the part of the people?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",9
"10","—I have to say that my land is very high rented, stony ground. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",10
"11","3092. I wish you first to speak on behalf of the whole people who have elected you. What do they complain of?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",11
"12","—Their cause of complaint is just the same as mine. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",12
"13","3093. Then go on ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",13
"14","—Hard stony ground, and part of my arable land has been cultivated during the whole time of my occupancy. We have no hill pasture. We are in a park surrounded by a dyke. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",14
"15","3094. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",15
"16","—Who is outside the dyke ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",16
"17","—Tenants who are above us on the hill, and on the other side another park. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",17
"18","3095. Crofters ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",18
"19","—Yes. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",19
"20","3096. Where is your place?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",20
"21","—About two miles further down. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",21
"22","3097. Sheriff Nicolson.",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",22
"23","—What do you think of the life and living of the people now, compared with what it was when you were young ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",23
"24","—They have no living now in comparison to what they had when I was young. They have much trouble and toil working the ground, which they had not then. There is not a man or a woman now but has to be out in spring working at the ground now; and when they are done with the spade, they have to drag the harrows themselves. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",24
"25","3098. Did they not work as hard before ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",25
"26","—No, they did not. They had horses that would do the work of ploughing and harrowing. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",26
"27","3099. Had they better food then than they have now ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",27
"28","—Yes, they had plenty of meal and flesh, some of them. Before they were spoiled, each one would have from ten to twenty sheep, four milk cows, two stirks, and two or three heifers to keep until the time for selling them ; but now I must sell my stirk for want of a keeping place before the proper time for selling. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",28
"29","3100. How often do you eat meat now?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",29
"30","—We do not eat flesh at all. We have not the wherewith to buy any, and we have no flesh of our own that we can eat. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",30
"31","3101. What is the principal article of food?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",31
"32","—Fish, meal and water, and milk. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",32
"33","3102. Do they take more whisky now-a-days or loss?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",33
"34","—I am not using much of it, at any rate. There is not more whisky consumed now. I remember whisky being manufactured down here, ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",34
"35","3103. Where did they get their whisky from out of Skye?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",35
"36","—From the Gairloch people; they were very kind people, but it is a long time since we have seen any of them. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",36
"37","3104. Was there a great deal of whisky privately made in Skye before the Carbost distillery was erected?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",37
"38","—Yes, some; but it is a long time since the manufacture stopped. There is not a drop being manufactured now. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",38
"39","3105. In those days, of course, there was no tea?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",39
"40","—No, not a drop. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",40
"41","3106. But there is a good deal now?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",41
"42","—Plenty of tea now. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",42
"43","3107. I suppose in the poorest houses in the parish they have tea regularly every day?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",43
"44","—Yes, in the poorest houses in the parish. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",44
"45","3108. How often every day?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",45
"46","—Twice a day, at any rate. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",46
"47","3109. Do they give tea to the children?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",47
"48","—Yes, what can poor people do when they have not got anything else ? They must take something to keep them alive. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",48
"49","3110. Are there any of them so poor that they havo no milk?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",49
"50","—Not many ; unless it may be some paupers. Some have a cow, some two. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",50
"51","3111. Since what time do you think their condition has begun to deteriorate ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",51
"52","—More than fifty years ago. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",52
"53","3112. And who was laird then?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",53
"54","—Mr Grant, afterwards Lord Glenelg. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",54
"55","3113. Was he a good landlord?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",55
"56","—Yes, he was; but factors were coming our way, who were spoiling the place. These arc the people who spoiled the place before the Macdonalds got it. I remember the time of ten shares in the township being at £ 4 of rent each, and a factor came who doubled the rent. That was before the Macdonalds became proprietors. He doubled that rent, and took the sea-ware from us. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",56
"57","3114. The Chairman.",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",57
"58","—Was the land at that time hold in 'run-rig,' or were the crofts already separated?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",58
"59","—They held the arable land in common. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",59
"60","3115. Sheriff Nicolson.",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",60
"61","—When was the land first divided among the crofters ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",61
"62","—Before the Macdonalds' time. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",62
"63","3116. Were there any people removed during that time, before the Macdonalds?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",63
"64","—Yes. Corry was the last factor, and he was before the Macdonalds' time, and he made a dyke by the roadside. He made parks down below the road to the sea-shore. He moved the people who had the arable land, and the grazing above down to that low land ; and he placed two and three on each lot, and ho put a sheep stock on the hill of which he deprived them. He took from them both sheep and horses ; but there weretwo townships to the north end of that, which he left as they were. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",64
"65","3117. What are they ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",65
"66","—Hallistra. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",66
"67","3118. Were there any removals made under Major Macdonald, the father of the present laird ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",67
"68","—-No, but these people became so poor that they could not pay the land, and much of the land was wasted, and the major had to move these people. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",68
"69","3119. Had the major a factor ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",69
"70","—No. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",70
"71","3120. And his son has never had a factor",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",71
"72","—No, ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",72
"73","3121. He manages his own lands ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",73
"74","—Yes. Any land which the captain set to tenants since he became landlord, he gave it to them at their own offer.",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",74
"75","3122. Has he any tacksmen on his estate, or has he in his own hands all except what the crofters have?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",75
"76","—No, he has no tacksmen. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",76
"77","3123. Mr Cameron.",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",77
"78","—You say they used to have horses formerly. Had they more arable land ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",78
"79","—Yes, much more, and had less rent than we pay now. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",79
"80","31241. How long ago is that?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",80
"81","—About fifty years ago. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",81
"82","3125. Has the poverty of the people been gradually increasing since that date ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",82
"83","—Yes, they are not gettiug richer at all by any means, and these years have spoiled them entirely. I paid £10 between rent and rates at last Martinmas, and six pecks of meal is aU that I made at the mill, and I had to buy for my family. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",83
"84","3126. You pay £10, and keep two cows and followers?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",84
"85","—Yes, £8, 18s. of rent. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",85
"86","3127. And you have two cows and followers ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",86
"87","—Sometimes I keep three; but I have to buy grass. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",87
"88","3128. Where is the arable land you used to cultivate when you had horses ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",88
"89","—Other crofters have it now ; it is just above us. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",89
"90","3129. Then, there were fewer crofters on the ground than there are now on that part of the estate ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",90
"91","—Yes, I think so. There are many crofters now. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",91
"92","3130. There are too many crofters for the land?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",92
"93","—Yes. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",93
"94","3131. How do you think it would answer if some of the crofters were to become fishermen, and depend entirely on fishing, and let the other crofters (their neighbours) get the land they occupy ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",94
"95","—Well, the fishing has gone against us for the past two years. The Government should give some assistance for the erection of a pier here, for fishermen pass out their lines in very stormy and dangerous weather. They are not in a position to get built boats with sufficient material. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",95
"96","3132. If you had boats found, and if a pier were erected, would it encourage the people to prosecute the fishing more than they do at present ? ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",96
"97","—Yes, it certainly would. They come from the east coast to fish at Barra ; and if the fishermen here were as efficiently equipped as these they would be encouraged to do otherwise. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",97
"98","3133. Then, in that case, do you think it would be for the advantage of the people at large, if a proportion of them were to devote themselves to fishing, and the remainder stick to the farming, and take up the crofts of those who prosecuted the fishing ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",98
"99","—I do not know that; a fisherman would need to have land also. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",99
"100","3134 Would it not be better for the community at largo if a proportion of them stuck to the land and the other proportion took up fishing, and let the land go to the rest so as to increase their holdings ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",100
"101","—What would do the crofters good would be for them to keep a horse to help to till the ground. I would rather have a horse just now, even should I only have one cow",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",101
"102","3135. Do you think any of your neighbours that you are acquainted with would be willing to give up their land and stick to the fishing, if they pat these advantages in the way of boats and a pier ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",102
"103","—I do not know. That is what I cannot say. I was not asking them about that. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",103
"104","3136. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",104
"105","—How many crofters are there in this township ? Five ; one left us. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",105
"106","3137. What became of that croft? ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",106
"107","—Another one has got it. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",107
"108","3138. Of yourselves?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",108
"109","—Another one of ourselves took the croft, and he has now two, ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",109
"110","3139. How long have you been in this place? I understand you were not born in this township?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",110
"111","—No; I was born not far from the present township, in a place called Reisagan. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",111
"112","3140. You have told us that you are surrounded on two sides by townships of crofters like your own. In these circumstances, how can your townships be extended except at the expense of your neighbours? You have accounted for two sides ; what is on the other side of you ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",112
"113","—The ground officer is on the other side of me, and other crofters. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",113
"114","3111. How is it possible, then, to increase your holdings in these circumstances ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",114
"115","—There is no way in which crofts which are enclosed in a park, as we are, can be increased, unless by removing some of those that surround us. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",115
"116","3112. Can you suggest what ought to be done to benefit you ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",116
"117","—If we would get hill pasture ; but the rent is heavy enough on us. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",117
"118","3113. Is there any hill pasture which would be convenient for you?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",118
"119","— Yes, there is such hill pasture above us, and in the hands of the landlord. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",119
"120","3114. What is the name of the place?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",120
"121","—Hallistra. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",121
"122","3115. That is the same place the previous witness spoke of?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",122
"123","—Yes. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",123
"124","3116. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",124
"125","—You mentioned that when crofts were vacant, the captain gave them to tenants at their own offer. Were the offers higher or lower than the previous ones ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",125
"126","—I cannot say. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",126
"127","3117. Were the six crofts in your township all at the same rent?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",127
"128","—No. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",128
"129","3118. Do you know if the tenant who got the two crofts paid the old rent for the extra croft that he took ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",129
"130","—I cannot say. I am informed that he has taken it as at this term of Whitsunday, and I am not sure if he has got it yet. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",130
"131","3119. The Chairman.",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",131
"132","—You stated that the people were better off when you were young—that they had better clothes and better food. When you were young were the people more cheerful and happy in their minds than they are now ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",132
"133","—I cannot say much about that, but their circumstances then were better than they are now. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",133
"134","3120. Had they more amusements and diversions than they have now ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",134
"135","—Yes, much more. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",135
"136","3151. What sort of diversions?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",136
"137","—Balls and dances at some times of the year",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",137
"138","—at Christmas. They don't have such now. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",138
"139","3152. Had they more music?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",139
"140","—Yes. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",140
"141","3153. What sort of music ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",141
"142","—Pipe We don't hear the pipe at all in the place now. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",142
"143","3154. Did they sing more?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",143
"144","—Yes, plenty of songs ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",144
"145","3155. Men and women?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",145
"146","—Yes. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",146
"147","3156. What has made them less cheerful? Have the clergy discountenanced those amusements, or is it the deterioration of their condition ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",147
"148","— The ministers of course were discountenancing it. The ministers won't be for the like of that at all. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",148
"149","3157. Sheriff Nicolson.",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",149
"150","—Are they against the pipe?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",150
"151","—I did not ask the gentlemen ; I cannot be sure. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",151
"152","3158. Have they expressed themselves against the singing of any songs except psalms and hymns ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",152
"153","—Yes, many a time. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",153
"154","3159. And the people pay great respect to the ministers?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",154
"155","—There are indeed some trifling songs that people would not be much the better of hearing sung. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",155
"156","3160. The Chairman.",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",156
"157","—Is it in any degree on account of their depressed circumstances that they have become less cheerful and fond of diversion ?-You may be sure of that; that their poverty is making them less cheerful. You may be sure that when a man is depressed with poverty he cannot be ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",157
"158","cheerful. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",158
"159","3161. Sheriff Nicolson.",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",159
"160","—In your early recollection were there young men going into the army from here ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",160
"161","—Yes. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",161
"162","3162. Did they go willingly or unwillingly ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",162
"163","—They were going willingly. ' ' ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",163
"164","3163. Are there many now 1",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",164
"165","—Not so many now. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",165
"166","3164. Have you any idea of the number that are now in the army from Waternish ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",166
"167","—No. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",167
"168","3165. Do you know how many pensioners there are in Waternish?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",168
"169","— No, but I believe the commanders who have come from Skye were the best that ever crossed the seas. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",169
"170","3166. Are there any pensioners in Waternish?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",170
"171","—I do not think there are. There was a time when there were some. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",171
"172","3167. What do you think is the reason why the young men do not care to go into the army now ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",172
"173","—I do not know very well. I cannot understand it very well. Some enter the army yet: perhaps hardships at home may compel them to list. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",173
"174","3168. Have there been any young men from Waternish that have risen in the army ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",174
"175","—Yes. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",175
"176","3169. Do you know any living now?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",176
"177","—Yes, Major M'Leod, now living in Edinburgh. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",177
"178","3170. He is the son of a crofter from Geary ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",178
"179","—Yes. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",179
"180","3171. Has that not given any encouragement to other lads to enlist ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",180
"181","— I would expect it to encourage them, but that lad was considerably steady, and he carved out a position for himself. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",181
"182","3172. Is it an exception among the young men here to be steady and well-behaved 1",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",182
"183","—I do not know any unsteadiness about them. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",183
"184","3173. Do many of them go to work in the south ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",184
"185","—If they don't, they will not get work here. They must go to the south, or die where they are. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",185
"186","3174. Do many of the young women go also ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",186
"187","—Yes, it is in the south that the women earn most of what supports them. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",187
"188","3175. Do they learn any bad habits there ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",188
"189","—I don:t know. I was not asking, neither am I seeing any bad habits. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",189
"190","3176. Have they had any visit during the last year or so, from any Irish gentlemen lecturing upon land rights ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",190
"191","—I am not aware ; I did not notice anything of the sort. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",191
"192","3177. Have their ideas been influenced to any extent by what they have heard about Ireland and out of Ireland, that is, about the land and their own condition ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",192
"193","—I do not know anything about that; I was not hearing. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",193
"194","3178. Do you know what has been done in Ireland for the improvement of the people ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",194
"195","—I do not know. I have not heard. I am not hearing so much about that now as I was hearing before. I think they are getting better now. We hope we will all be better of the Commissioners' arrival here. If we are the worse of it, it will be a bad business. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",195
"196","3179. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",196
"197","—You have stated, or the previous witness stated, that there were no tacksmen upon this property ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",197
"198","—Yes. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",198
"199","3180. Who live in the slated houses down near the shore ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",199
"200","—Most of them are merchants, and people who live in rented apartments. ",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",200
"201","3181. Are some of these people in fairly good circumstances ? Are they reputed to be in fairly good circumstances ?",52,"John Mclean","Skye, Waternish",201
