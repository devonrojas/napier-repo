"2","46538. Sheriff Nicolson.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",2
"3","—You have heard all that has been said by Mr Carmichael and Mr Macmillan ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",3
"4","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",4
"5","46539. I suppose you agree with what they said, or have you anything additional or different to state ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",5
"6","—I do not think it. I think they have told near as much as they could tell you in connection with the fishing.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",6
"7","46540. You have been a fisherman here all your life ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",7
"8","—Yes, except when there were bad seasons when I had to go away from home.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",8
"9","46541. To fish in another place ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",9
"10","—Sometimes to fish in other places and sometimes to sea.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",10
"11","46542. Have there been many bad seasons here in your recollection ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",11
"12","—I remember four or five since 1859.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",12
"13","46513. Was the fishing in Loch Fyne at that time a comparative failure ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",13
"14","—Yes, a comparative failure in 1859 or 1860.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",14
"15","46544. Did many of your fishermen go away as you did to other places ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",15
"16","—Yes, they went to Jura to fish, and some went to sea, and some, I suppose, went to work in Glasgow and different places where they could get work.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",16
"17","46545. Did they all go away ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",17
"18","—Well, those that had not a bit of ground had to go away. I suppose those that had a bit of ground stopped at home.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",18
"19","46546. How many are there that have ground ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",19
"20","—I cannot say how many have ground, but there are a few. I suppose there were more in olden times that had ground than there are now.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",20
"21","46547. But it is only very small crofts that they have?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",21
"22","—Very small.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",22
"23","46548. How many acres ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",23
"24","—They vary in size. I cannot say how many acres they have.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",24
"25","46549. Do any of them keep more than one cow ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",25
"26","—Not just now; but they used to have a great many cows about the village long ago. I was told there were so many as eighty cows about the village at one time.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",26
"27","46550. Belonging to the inhabitants ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",27
"28","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",28
"29","46551. Where did they get grass?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",29
"30","—I suppose they had the hill as grass for their cows at that time.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",30
"31","46552. Is that hill now joined to a large sheep farm ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",31
"32","—Yes, joined to a sheep farm.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",32
"33","46553. And they are generally satisfied with their condition ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",33
"34","—Yes, so far as I know. ",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",34
"35","46554. There is none of that great desire for additional land that exists in other parts of the Highlands?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",35
"36","—No, I do not think it ; but I daresay there are no fishermen but would like to have a bit garden if they",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",36
"37","could get it.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",37
"38","46555. Would they be quite satisfied with that?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",38
"39","—Yes. Of course, everybody could not have crofts about here.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",39
"40","46556. But I suppose everybody would like to have a cow if possible ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",40
"41","—Yes, if possible.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",41
"42","46557. You are well acquainted, I suppose, with most of the inhabitants of Tarbert ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",42
"43","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",43
"44","46558. Does every fisherman whom you are acquainted with make a good living by his occupation as fisherman ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",44
"45","—Taking one year with another, they get through pretty well; but I know different ones that perhaps two or three seasons might go against, while the rest did well enough; and if you had a year or two of bad seasons, you had plenty to do to make both ends meet.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",45
"46","46559. Are there any that lay by money, or are able to do so?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",46
"47","—Yes, there are some that lay by money.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",47
"48","46560. Any considerable number ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",48
"49","—I cannot say. They seem to be pretty well off in general.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",49
"50","46561. Have you any mutual aid society ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",50
"51","—They have a branch of the Foresters' Society here.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",51
"52","46562. Is it composed largely of fishermen?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",52
"53","—They are mixed, some fishermen and some tradesmen.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",53
"54","46563. What are the objects of that society?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",54
"55","—I believe there is a benefit attached to it if they happened to get hurt.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",55
"56","46564. And in case of death is anything given?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",56
"57","—I have not read the regulations of the society, and I am not a member myself.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",57
"58","46565. Is there any difference between the style of fishing and boats used by the people here and those in Upper Loch Fyne ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",58
"59","—Yes, there is a difference; although you were to go from Land's End to Cape Wrath you would get a difference in every port you came to.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",59
"60","46566. What is the difference between your boats and those at Ardrishaig?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",60
"61","—The Ardrishaig people generally have their boats made to suit both the drift net and the trawl. Our boats are built to suit only the trawl. They are pretty generally on the same lines, but the others have more beam, and use more sail and have taller masts.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",61
"62","46567. Is there a considerable number of the fishermen at Ardrishaig occupied entirely as fishermen the same as here ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",62
"63","—Yes, between Ardrishaig and Lochgilphead.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",63
"64","46568. Are there many on the east side of the loch who are exclusively fishermen ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",64
"65","—Yes, there are some small villages up the loch.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",65
"66","46569. And the people are constantly engaged in fishing the same as you are ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",66
"67","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",67
"68","46570. Do they make as good a living by it, so far as you know ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",68
"69","—They used generally to be working drift nets, but the way the herrings were this season they had to give up the drift nets entirely and begin trawling, as there is a fleet of trawlers up there now, and they did pretty well last year and thid season, but they do not make their tobacco at the drift nets.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",69
"70","46571. Are their circumstances as regards land in those villages on the other side of the loch similar to yours?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",70
"71","—I suppose Ardrishaig and Lochgilphead are similar to us, but I don't think they have as much benefit as we have. We can draw our boats on the beach, and we are charged nothing for it. I believe they are charged for beaching their boats up there.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",71
"72","46572. Who charges them?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",72
"73","—The proprietor.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",73
"74","40573. Who is the proprietor?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",74
"75","—Campbell of Auchendarroch, and Sir John Orde.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",75
"76","46571. What have they to pay for the privilege of hauling up their boats ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",76
"77","—They have to pay 2s. 6d.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",77
"78","46575. For the season?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",78
"79","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",79
"80","46576. They only pay it once ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",80
"81","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",81
"82","46577. They have no other dues to pay there ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",82
"83","—They have dues to pay if they take their boats into the canal basin.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",83
"84","46578. What do they pay?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",84
"85","—I think Is. every time they take them in.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",85
"86","46579. You have no dues to pay here ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",86
"87","—Only Is. 3d. a year for harbour dues.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",87
"88","46580. And your harbour is a very good one ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",88
"89","—It is a very safe one.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",89
"90","46581. Your piers also are quite satisfactory and well built, are they not ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",90
"91","—Yes, they could be improved.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",91
"92","46582. What improvement!",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",92
"93","—There could be better quays built and the harbour improved a little, to make work for men when they are going idle.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",93
"94","46583. Would it be a very costly thing ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",94
"95","—No, I do not think so.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",95
"96","46584. What do you propose?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",96
"97","—I would propose deepening this end of the harbour and making more room for fishing boats, as the fishing fleet is increasing very greatly on this coast, and in the summer when steamers and herring boats are in the harbour you cannot move; sometimes you get boats smashed.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",97
"98","46585. At whose expense do you think that should be done ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",98
"99","—I suppose the Government and the proprietor.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",99
"100","46586. But I suppose if that were done you would not object to pay something for it ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",100
"101","—No, I do not suppose we would object to pay a little extra.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",101
"102","46587. For the benefit you would receive through it ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",102
"103","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",103
"104","46588. The Chairman.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",104
"105","—We were told there is no truck system here —that you were under no obligation to buy at any place, but that you have perfect freedom in that way ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",105
"106","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",106
"107","46589. Has it never been the custom at all for people to keep an account with a shop, and to receive goods on credit, and to pay any debts in fish or in any other way ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",107
"108","—No, that is not a customary way here. We begin to fish say at the beginning of the week. Well, on Saturday the cash is made up between the eight men, and we divide it. Perhaps we may keep a share out to pay debt for boats or nets, and then go and settle with the merchant.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",108
"109","46590. But you always settle with the merchant in money ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",109
"110","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",110
"111","46591. You never deliver fish to the merchant ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",111
"112","—No.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",112
"113","46592. So there is no barter ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",113
"114","—No.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",114
"115","46593. Did you ever hear of that system in old times ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",115
"116","—Not in my recollection, and I never heard of it.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",116
"117","46594. You mentioned that in former times there were a number of cows kept here, and that they went out on the hill ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",117
"118","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",118
"119","46595. Which hill?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",119
"120","—The village was divided, and I believe some went to each side of the harbour.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",120
"121","46596. The pasture is not very good, I suppose?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",121
"122","—I think they were thriving pretty well at that time.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",122
"123","46597. How many acres would it take to keep a cow upon these hills ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",123
"124","—I cannot give you any right idea, as I was never in the line of keeping them. ",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",124
"125","46598. Is there anybody here who can tell me how many acres it takes to keep a cow on the pasture here ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",125
"126","—[Mr Hugh Maclean]. About three acres. ",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",126
"127","46599. Do you mean the hill ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",127
"128","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",128
"129","46600. But upon the wild heather pasture, how many acres would it take ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",129
"130","—It is not on the heather pasture that the common is.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",130
"131","46601. But I do not see anything else?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",131
"132","—There are twenty-one cows upon the pasture.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",132
"133","46602. About these cows, when the cows were kept how was it managed; was there a common herd for all the cows, who drove them out and brought them home ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",133
"134","—[Mr Paterson]. Yes ; there was a herd during my time, and I was speaking to one of the old herds who used to herd fifty or sixty years ago, and he told me that he used to have like a foghorn which he blew to drive the cattle away on each side of the village.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",134
"135","46603. Is there anything of that sort now ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",135
"136","—No ; I think every one looks after his own cow.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",136
"137","46604. So there is still common on which the cows go ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",137
"138","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",138
"139","46605. How many cows would there be now ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",139
"140","—I cannot say how many there are in the village now, but some have bits of fields of their own.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",140
"141","46606. Are there any small proprietors that have their own fields ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",141
"142","—No, I do not think so. There is no proprietor except Stonefield.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",142
"143","46607. How much will a man pay to the proprietor for the grazing of a cow ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",143
"144","—I think it is £ 1 .",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",144
"145","46608. For the summer grazing ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",145
"146","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",146
"147","46609. Or for the grazing of all the year round ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",147
"148","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",148
"149","46610. How does he keep his cow in winter ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",149
"150","—I suppose he has a little hay, and if he has not, I suppose he just purchases it.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",150
"151","46611. How long is it since the hill was withdrawn and given to the farm ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",151
"152","—I cannot answer that.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",152
"153","—[Mr Macmillan]. About forty-two years.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",153
"154","46612. If the proprietor gave you back the hill would the people consider it a benefit, or would they consider it a trouble to have the cows ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",154
"155","—Mr Paterson. I think those that are able to work with a cow would consider it a benefit. There are a considerable number that would not be better with it, but for those who are acquainted with it I suppose it would be a great boon to get it.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",155
"156","46613. Is there anybody in the neighbourhood who keeps a number of cows for the supply of the place ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",156
"157","—There is a dairy about one and a half miles, and another about six miles, and another about half a mile away, and they supply the village with milk.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",157
"158","46614. Does the milk come in every morning ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",158
"159","—Every morning.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",159
"160","46615. Is it getting dearer, or is it the same price that it used to be?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",160
"161","—Pretty much about the same price, only the supply is scarce for the use of the village in winter.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",161
"162","46616. We heard that the proprietor is willing to give ground to feuing, but that the people consider the price high. When a fisherman saves a little money here, would he generally wish to put his money into a piece of ground and a house, or would he rather put it into the bank ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",162
"163","—Well, there are some of them who generally build when they save up what will manage to build a house.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",163
"164","46617. They like to build ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",164
"165","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",165
"166","46618. Is the desire to possess a house increasing in the place'?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",166
"167","—It has been increasing this few years.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",167
"168","46619. When they build do they do it more for the convenience of their own families and for their own satisfaction, or do they do it as a speculation to let it to others ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",168
"169","—I think they do it for their own benefit, and also to let it. Their money will draw more interest than lying in the bank.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",169
"170","46620. So they would build a house bigger than they require for their own families ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",170
"171","—Generally they do.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",171
"172","46621. Would they let it to strangers, or would they let it to people of their own condition—other fishermen?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",172
"173","—Some let them to fishermen, and some keep them for letting to visitors in summer.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",173
"174","46622. Do they often sell houses ; is there a good deal of sale and purchase going on ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",174
"175","—I know of only one house that was built by a fisherman and was sold.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",175
"176","46623. There is no society or association which builds houses on the principle of the members gradually paying up the price ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",176
"177","—No.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",177
"178","46624. When a man builds a house does he generally have money enough to build and finish it, or does he have to borrow money or partly borrow money ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",178
"179","—I suppose they generally start with the intention of finishing it ; but if they have not enough they generally borrow from the nearest bank.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",179
"180","46625. Would they borrow from a neighbour or friend, or from the bank ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",180
"181","—Well, the bank is very good to the natives of the village in advancing money.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",181
"182","46626. Suppose a man wanted money advanced upon his house, what interest would he pay ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",182
"183","—I suppose about 4 or 5 per cent.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",183
"184","46627. Not more than five ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",184
"185","—I cannot say.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",185
"186","46628. Are you proprietor of your own house ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",186
"187","—No.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",187
"188","46629. Or your father ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",188
"189","—No.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",189
"190","46630. Professor Mackinnon.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",190
"191","—During the bad years you had to go away to the fishing, what parts of Scotland were you fishing in ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",191
"192","—We were fishing in Jura in 1859 and 1860, and four or five years ago we had to go to Loch Seaforth in Harris and Loch Hourn.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",192
"193","46631. You took your own boats along with you?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",193
"194","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",194
"195","46632. Then, of course, the boats you met with in these places were different from yours?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",195
"196","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",196
"197","46633. Bigger ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",197
"198","—In some of the lochs they had boats as small as ours, only built on a different principle, to suit drift nets.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",198
"199","46634. Your boats are built to suit Loch Fyne and trawling?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",199
"200","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",200
"201","46635. And for that purpose you think they are perfectly suited ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",201
"202","—They are suited for trawling.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",202
"203","46636. During all the time you have been a fisherman yourself have any strangers from the outside come in and settled here as fishermen ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",203
"204","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",204
"205","46637. From where ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",205
"206","—Some from round about Kintyre, and perhaps Knapdaleside.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",206
"207","46638. But I may take it that all the fishermen of Tarbert are really natives of this country?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",207
"208","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",208
"209","46639. And the children of people of this country ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",209
"210","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",210
"211","46640. So that they have grown up to be fishermen here by their own training ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",211
"212","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",212
"213","46641. Of late years there has been more building going on. I suppose that has been the result of the successful fishing of the last few years ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",213
"214","—Yes. The village depends entirely on the fishing.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",214
"215","46642. And you think there are a greater number every year who are able to lay by some money?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",215
"216","—Yes, I think so, because we have improved both in nets and boats, and we have a better market.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",216
"217","46643. Of course, your memory does not go very far back, but do you think that the practice is growing of laying by some money when people can lay it by?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",217
"218","—I think it is more so now than it was formerly. I think people are more saving now than they used to be in former times.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",218
"219","46644. So in two ways their condition is being improved; they are getting more thrifty, and they are getting more of an income from year to year ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",219
"220","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",220
"221","46645. A favourite way of investing the money seems to be in building a house ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",221
"222","—It seems to be so.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",222
"223","46646. When one is able to lay by money, or his family is able to lay by money, he likes to build a house, and be generally builds it better and larger than if it were for himself alone ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",223
"224","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",224
"225","46647. In those places, Loch Seaforth, Loch Hourn, and so on, the people are not nearly so well off as they are here?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",225
"226","—Well, I saw some people who were very well off away down about Scalpa Island, at Loch Tarbert in Harris.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",226
"227","46648. But take them all over, the people on the west coast are not so well off as they are here?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",227
"228","—Of course, they are not; but there are people away up towards Stornoway that are very well off, with large boats, and working on an extensive scale.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",228
"229","46649. Those that have big boats, and are able to go anywhere, will be quite as well off as the fishermen here?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",229
"230","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",230
"231","46650. But in those places they do not have boats except in comparatively small numbers. Everybody here has generally a share of a boat ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",231
"232","—Anybody that works here can only work in a company of four, so that the boats and nets are among the four, and Jack is as good as his master.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",232
"233","46651. While in other places the master has hired men and pays them wages ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",233
"234","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",234
"235","46652. And then the master is usually better off?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",235
"236","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",236
"237","46653. I suppose in fair average years the condition of a fisherman here is better than that of a common sailor?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",237
"238","—Yes, unless a man was perhaps on some part of the coast where he got high wages.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",238
"239","46654. But taking it generally, and comparing the condition of a fisherman living here from year to year and that of a man sailing from Greenock, with his family living there,—you would consider the condition of the Tarbert fisherman quite superior?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",239
"240","—Quite superior—quite different altogether.—because we are our own masters; and when we are working it is for ourselves, and we do our best to make a living.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",240
"241","46655. And as a rule, one year with another since you began to fish, you do well—you are very much better off than a man sailing from Glasgow or Greenock?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",241
"242","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",242
"243","46656. The Chairman.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",243
"244","—If a fisherman makes a good deal of money and saves it, is he inclined to embark in trade or in some other occupation, or does he generally keep his money and go on with his own proper business?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",244
"245","—They very seldom go to any other business, except that an odd one may take a shop or the like of that, but they have been very scarce that have done that. Some have gone to the fish buying.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",245
"246","46656*. But generally they would just put the money into a house, or keep it in bank and live on the interest of it ?",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",246
"247","—Yes.",747,"Archibald Paterson","Argyll, Tarbert",247
