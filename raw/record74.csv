"1","ANGUS M'FARLANE, Crofter, Harlosh (52)—examined. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",1
"2","4200. The Chairman.",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",2
"3","—How long have you been in your croft?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",3
"4","—I have been twenty years in the township, and ten years on my present croft. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",4
"5","4201. Were you elected by the people of Harlosh to be their delegate ? ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",5
"6","—Yes. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",6
"7","4202. How many of the people joined in electing you ?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",7
"8","—I  cannot be sure how many were present on the night on which we were  gathered. That was Saturday last, in the schoolhouse at Kihnuir. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",8
"9","4203. Were all the crofters there, or most of them ?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",9
"10","—There was a good number of them. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",10
"11","4204. And they elected you?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",11
"12","—Yes; and the minister was present. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",12
"13","4205. How many do you mean by a good number?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",13
"14","—There were up to twenty. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",14
"15","4206. What statement have you to make on behalf of those people ?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",15
"16","—  That we are gathered together on the worst spot of Mr Scobie's tack,  near the shore, and that we are surrounded by a dyke, which dyke is  surmounted by wire fencing to keep us into the shore. We ourselves were  made to pay half of the expense of that dyke to keep us in that pinfold.  I myself in one year paid to account of expense of that dyke 24s. 4d.,  to the best of my recollection. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",16
"17","4207. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",17
"18","—Are you paying every year for it?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",18
"19","—  No, we are not paying it every year. The delegate who preceded me was  making complaint that we were without roadway. Our road lies through a  peat moss, and in winter we cannot use it for taking home our peats.  Where there are two women taking home a creel of peats each, the one  woman often has to drag the other out of the mud, the road is so bad.  Now, as a remedy for the hardships of the people, I think they should  get the ground and the hill pasture along with the arable—from  ten to twelve acres of arable ground along with as much hill pasture as  would graze from forty to sixty sheep, with four cows and their  followers, and a horse to work the ground. They cannot make use of the  ground without a horse, even should they get that ground; and even  should they have such land given them it would be without profit to  them, unless they would get assurance from Government that no landlord  would have the power to evict them, after they had cleared that ground  and improved it for themselves. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",19
"20","4208. The ground you would have to get would have to be taken from tacks ?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",20
"21","—Yes ; the tacksmen have the ground. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",21
"22","4209. Would you, at the outset, be willing to pay what the tacksmen pay for it ?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",22
"23","—Yes, indeed we would ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",23
"24","4210. Sheriff Nicolson.",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",24
"25","—Does Mr Scobie reside in Feorlick?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",25
"26","—No, not in the island. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",26
"27","4211. Has he ever resided there?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",27
"28","—I am not aware that he was ever residing there. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",28
"29","4212. Who has charge in his absence?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",29
"30","—A man of the name of John Clark. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",30
"31","4213. Ground officer?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",31
"32","—As manager; he is overlooking everything. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",32
"33","4214. How long is it since any tacksman resided at Feorlick ?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",33
"34","—I cannot enter upon that, for there are only twenty years since I came to Feorlick, and Scobie was there before me. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",34
"35","4215. He has Balmore too ?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",35
"36","—Yes. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",36
"37","4216. There used to be a tacksman living there ?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",37
"38","—Yes. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",38
"39","4217. Is there a tacksman at Vatten now?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",39
"40","—Yes; they are included in one tack. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",40
"41","4218. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",41
"42","—If the Harlosh people got Feorlick could they stock it ?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",42
"43","—I believe they could not very well do so on their getting it; but I do not doubt they would be able to stock it through time. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",43
"44","4219. They could not pay rent for it till it was stocked?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",44
"45","—Yes,  they could do it. They are paying rent already every year. I am only  paying £2, 13s. and a few pence. I am at the least spending £8 in  purchasing meal. Would not that pay a good bit of land for me? ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",45
"46","4220. How many people are there in Harlosh ?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",46
"47","—I think it is twenty-nine lots. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",47
"48","4221. Families?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",48
"49","—I cannot tell the number of inhabitants. There are thirty families in Harlosh. ",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",49
"50","4222. Sheriff Nicolson.",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",50
"51","—Do you get the sea-ware free?",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",51
"52","—No,  we do not get it free. We have free as much sea-ware as our fore-shore  yields, but we pay Scobie for what we get from the rest of the shore.",74,"Angus Mcfarlane","Skye, Dunvegan",52
