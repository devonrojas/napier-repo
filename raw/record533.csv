"6","To the Royal Commissioners, Highlands and Islands,",533,"Christopher Macrae, David Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",6
"7","—We the undersigned, on behalf of the tenants of Camusluinie, the property of Sir Alexander Matheson, Bart., Lochalsh, humbly beg to submit the following statement, which is a true representation of our grievances :",533,"Christopher Macrae, David Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",7
"8","—When Sir Alexander Matheson bought the property in 1851 our rent was £140. The glen of Frauchcorry was then taken from us. In this glen we used to summer our horses, young cattle, and sheep for five months in one year. We consider this our greatest grievance, as in consequence of having been deprived of this glen we had to sell most of our stock, as we had no place to keep them and no means of supporting them. We got a reduction in the rent of only £15 for the loss of this glen. In 1860 our rent was raised from £120 to £160, because of some ìmprovements which the proprietor began to make on our land, and at the same time two large pieces of land were taken from us for plantations. The improvements promised when our rent was raised to £160 have not been completed yet. In 1882 we sent a petition to our proprietor, stating that it was impossible for us any longer to pay the rent charged, and requested him to reduce the rent to £120, and make the improvements promised. The rent was then reduced to £132, on condition that we would pay up all arrears. We consider this rent too high; it would be easier for us to pay a rent of £140, if we had Frauchcorry, than £100 without it, under present circumstances. We also got notice from the factor by letter and by telegram that other parties were wanting Camusluinie, and we were asked to send an immediate reply, as he could not "" be hanging on in this way for us, keeping other people in suspense."" Our land lies very low at the foot of high bills, and the heavy rains in winter carry away the substance of the soil into the river Elchaig in front, and the river when flooded carries off even the soil itself. There is no bridge across this river, which is very broad, and there is no way by which we can go from Camusluinie with a cart except by crossing this river. We consider, when we pay road money, we should have a road across the river, and we would be most willing to assist in the construction of a bridge, if materials were provided for it. The want of a bridge is also a great disadvantage in regard to the children attending school, as m the winter time the river is often impassable for days. We earnestly trust that the Royal Commission will consider our case favourably, and do for us what is just and reasonable.",533,"Christopher Macrae, David Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",8
