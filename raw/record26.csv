"2","1431. The Chairman.",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",2
"3","—Are you a fisherman as well as a crofter?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",3
"4","—No.",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",4
"5","1432. You have been freely elected by the people as their delegate?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",5
"6","— Yes. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",6
"7","1433. Have you been always resident here, and are you well acquainted with the condition and the wishes of the people ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",7
"8","—Yes, to the best of my judgment, ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",8
"9","1434. Will you have the goodness to make your statement of the grievances and hardships, if any, of which the people whom you represent complain ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",9
"10","—Want of sufficient land to support their families, and that at a reasonable rent, as the place would afford, We are wanting that we should be treated as we hear other parts of the country are treated,—that we would not be removed from our holdings. These are the desires and the grievances, and I have not much more to say. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",10
"11","1435. Can you suggest anything which could be done to remedy theso grievances?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",11
"12","—More land, out of which we could support ourselves. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",12
"13","1436. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",13
"14","—What amount of land do you possess?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",14
"15","—Two acres and a half, I believe. Six stones of meal is all I have been able to make during the last sixteen years. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",15
"16","1437. Do you thresh all your corn ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",16
"17","—Yes, we thresh all the com, unless we give a sheaf to the beasts. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",17
"18","1438. Do you give half the sheaves to the beasts?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",18
"19","—Yes, and more. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",19
"20","1439. Do you take to the mill all that you thresh?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",20
"21","—No, it would not be worth while. I would not have half a boll of oats altogether. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",21
"22","1440. What do you do with it when you thresh it?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",22
"23","—I give it to the stock after threshing it. I must needs do that. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",23
"24","1441. Then you have made six stones of meal in the last sixteen years ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",24
"25","—Yes. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",25
"26","1442. And the rest you have given to the cattle?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",26
"27","—Yes, I sow seven bushels of seed oats. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",27
"28","1443. How much potato seed do you plant?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",28
"29","—About four or four and a half barrels. My land cannot plant more. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",29
"30","1444. Is it all under crop?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",30
"31","—Not altogether. Some of it cannot be cropped. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",31
"32","1445. Is it in grass ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",32
"33","—In the sort of grass in which it ever was. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",33
"34","1446. Do the cattle graze the grass, or do you cut it?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",34
"35","—The cattle eat it. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",35
"36","1447. What stock have you?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",36
"37","—A cow and a two-year-old I am entitled to keep, and I cannot winter the cow on the croft. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",37
"38","1448. What do you buy for it?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",38
"39","—About £2 worth of feeding, besides the crop of the ground. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",39
"40","1449. Have you any sheep ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",40
"41","—A few. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",41
"42","1450. How many ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",42
"43","—About twelve. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",43
"44","1451. Any horse ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",44
"45","—I have a horse. I am the only one in the place who has a horse. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",45
"46","1452. Does the £2 worth of fodder you buy include the keep of the horse ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",46
"47","—The keep of the horse is exclusive of what I have mentioned. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",47
"48","1453. What do you buy besides for the keep of the horse?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",48
"49","—I spent about £3 more for the keep of the horse besides the £2. That would not feed him, but he gets food when out at work with others. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",49
"50","1454. Do you make a profit of the horse?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",50
"51","—That was what I had in view in keeping it, but the principal profit which it is to me is that it does my work. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",51
"52","1455. Of course for 2½ acres you do not want a horse's labour. Do you employ the horse otherwise for hire?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",52
"53","—Yes, that is the case. I use the horse to take home my fuel. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",53
"54","1456. How far are you from the moss?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",54
"55","—Three miles. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",55
"56","1457. Do you bring home peats for other people too?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",56
"57","—Yes. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",57
"58","1458. For payment?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",58
"59","—Yes. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",59
"60","1459. What is your rent?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",60
"61","—£4, 12s. 6d., but I got a reduction about four years ago. We got 5s. in the pound. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",61
"62","1460. What do you pay now ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",62
"63","—About £3, 11s. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",63
"64","1461. You spoke about being treated like other parts of the country. What other parts of the country do you refer to ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",64
"65","—I do not mean in the country in which I am — I refer to Ireland. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",65
"66","1462. Do you want a lease, or to have the land for your own?—I do not want a lease at all; I wish that we would have the land to ourselves.",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",66
"67","1463. At what rent do you think you ought to have it?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",67
"68","—I cannot say until I would see the amount of land we would get. I would require as much as would keep up a family. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",68
"69","1464. Where would you expect to get this ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",69
"70","—Unless I would get it on the land where I am. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",70
"71","1465. But in any place?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",71
"72","—There is plenty of land. I do not see anyland in possession of the crofters which is not too small for them already. I would take the land which we require from those who have got too much of it. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",72
"73","1466. Supposing a large farm taken and divided among the crofters, would the crofters pay the same rent that the large farmers pay ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",73
"74","—I cannot say much about that, but I believe it would be heavy on them to pay it. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",74
"75","1467. Sheriff Nicolson.",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",75
"76","—How long have you been where you are ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",76
"77","—I have been five years in the spot in which I am now. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",77
"78","1468. Where were you before?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",78
"79","—In a spot near it. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",79
"80","1469. Why were you moved?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",80
"81","—To give my land to another. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",81
"82","1470. Who ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",82
"83","—The innkeeper here. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",83
"84","1471. What were you paying before ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",84
"85","—The rent was raised twice on me; I was removed twice. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",85
"86","1472. Where were you removed from the former time?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",86
"87","—From North Cuil first. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",87
"88","1473. Why were you removed from that?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",88
"89","—Because the landlord was wanting that land for himself. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",89
"90","1474. How much were you paying in that first place ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",90
"91","—£3, 10s. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",91
"92","1475. What stock had you there ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",92
"93","—A cow and a calf. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",93
"94","1476. How much did you pay in the second place?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",94
"95","—£9, 15s. at first. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",95
"96","1477. And was that raised?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",96
"97","—It was not that the rent was raised, but I was put out of the land. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",97
"98","1478. Had you been paying your rent regularly?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",98
"99","—Yes. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",99
"100","1479. Was there any complaint against you?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",100
"101","—I am not aware there was any. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",101
"102","1480. What stock had you?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",102
"103","—Seven cows, a horse, and I do not remember how many sheep. I could keep about thirty sheep. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",103
"104","1481. Did that support you and your family comfortably?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",104
"105","—I was middling comfortable on it. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",105
"106","1482. Are you not so now?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",106
"107","—No. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",107
"108","1483. What other means of living have you besides your bit of croft?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",108
"109","—Only what I earn with the help of the horse, unless I buy and sell a beast. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",109
"110","1484. Is there any work to be got here?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",110
"111","—Some. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",111
"112","1485. What kind ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",112
"113","—Field labour. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",113
"114","1486. Is there any regular work?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",114
"115","—No, not every day. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",115
"116","1487. What wages are given ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",116
"117","—I cannot say from personal experience. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",117
"118","1488. Have more of the people been removed from that same place which you were in ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",118
"119","—Yes. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",119
"120","1489. At the same time with you ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",120
"121","—Yes, the last time I was removed. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",121
"122","1490. What year was that ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",122
"123","—Five or six years ago. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",123
"124","1491. How many tenants were removed ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",124
"125","—Five, I think. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",125
"126","1492. Where were they sent to?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",126
"127","—Two of them are still in Bensoraig, one in Glen Ilinisdale, and another in Idrigill. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",127
"128","1493. Were any others removed within a few years back?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",128
"129","—There were no removals since then, but at that time five were removed from the other side of the loch. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",129
"130","1494. Why were they removed?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",130
"131","—I do not know of anything but the will of the landlord. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",131
"132","1495. Who was the tenant?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",132
"133","—Donald Ross has got their land now. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",133
"134","1496. Who got the land of the other people in Bensoraig?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",134
"135","—Mr Urquhart, the innkeeper. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",135
"136","1497. Are the two men in Bensoraig living on land left to them? —One of them has got land, and I do uot think the other has got any.",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",136
"137","1498. Had he before ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",137
"138","—No; it was not good crofts before; there was not a good croft in it. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",138
"139","1499. Has any hill pasture been taken away from the people about here in your recollection, which they had before?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",139
"140","—Not about here. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",140
"141","1500. Have you any difficulty in paying your rent?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",141
"142","—Yes. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",142
"143","1501. Are you in arrears just now?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",143
"144","—Yes. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",144
"145","1502. Have you ever given a bill for payment of the rent?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",145
"146","— Yes. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",146
"147","1503. Who would sign the bill for you?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",147
"148","—A brother of mine signed it once. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",148
"149","1504. Is there a good deal of that done on this property?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",149
"150","—There was at any rate at one time. I was signing plenty of them myself. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",150
"151","1505. Was that when you were in the other place ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",151
"152","—When I was in the other place; but it is not my having been removed that has left me so unable to do what I could do before. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",152
"153","1506. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",153
"154","—You say that when you were first removed it was the landlord who wanted the place. Has the landlord that place still ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",154
"155","—Mr Urquhart has now got the land from which I was first removed, under a tack. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",155
"156","1507. Who was in the place where you now are before you were put there ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",156
"157","—The man who occupied it before me is not living. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",157
"158","1508. Then you went into an empty croft?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",158
"159","—Yes. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",159
"160","1509. Have these removals been prejudicial to you? Have you been falling off at each removal ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",160
"161","—Yes, falling off, and that not little. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",161
"162","1510. Are you able to say, from your own observation in regard to other people who have been removed and shifted in this way, whether it has ever been for their benefit or whether it has been the reverse?—Possibly there may have been one who was bettered, but I do not remember an instance but it was worse for every one of them.",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",162
"163","1511. Is the population upon this estate or in this very neighbourhood increasing or decreasing, or stationary?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",163
"164","—The population is increasing, I believe, but many have to leave the country because of the smallness of the holdings. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",164
"165","1512. With regard to the fishings in this bay, are you well acquainted with the fishing in this bay and neighbourhood ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",165
"166","—Yes, I am acquainted with the fishing in this bay, but there is no fishing now. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",166
"167","1513. Why?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",167
"168","—The fish are not there. I believe there are three years that they have got no fishings. They have spoiled their tackle in their endeavours to fish during that time. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",168
"169","1514. What do you mean by that?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",169
"170","—Using the tackle and no fish in it. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",170
"171","1515. Are there no herring?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",171
"172","—No herring is to be found here. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",172
"173","1516. Then a quay for landing their boats and going off would practically be of no use in this particular spot?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",173
"174","—I have seen fishing here before, and there may be fishing yet, and the quay would certainly not be in the  way here. A quay would be of good service to us, for we could get our supplies landed without loss or damage, as it is from the south country we are getting our supplies. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",174
"175","1517. Suppose you could have a quay where you could go in and out in all ordinary weather, would people go to some distance to fish ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",175
"176","—Yes. I cannot say they would go out in all weathers, but they would go out in any likely weather. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",176
"177","1518. They would do that?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",177
"178","—Oh yes ; they are doing so now they use their endeavours now in very unlikely weather. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",178
"179","1519. Is this bay very much exposed to the west winds?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",179
"180","—Yes; the shelter would be on the other side, on the north side, in such weather. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",180
"181","1520. Professor Mackinnon.",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",181
"182","—When you had that croft from which you were removed last, the £9, 15s. croft, did you consider the rent too high?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",182
"183","—Not at the time. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",183
"184","1521. Was the croft big enough?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",184
"185","—A good part of it was of use to me. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",185
"186","1522. And with regard to the croft which you have now, do you complain that it is too small or that the rent is too high ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",186
"187","—The rent is too high. Should I have the croft for nothing it would not be of use to me. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",187
"188","1523. The rent is too high, but the worst tiling is that the croft is too small ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",188
"189","—Yes. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",189
"190","1524. What about the houses?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",190
"191","—When I left the first place I got £7 as the value of the house I left. The wall of that house cost me £15 to build. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",191
"192","1525. Then the second ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",192
"193","—At the next place from which I was removed, I quarried all the stones for the house which I built, and I got no compensation for it. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",193
"194","1526. And did you build the house in which you are just now?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",194
"195","—The house in which I am just now I found built,—the wall of it at least. I myself put the roof on it, and I am asked to pay 15s. of rent for the bare walls, and I got nothing for the walls that I left behind. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",195
"196","1527. To whom have you to pay this 15s. ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",196
"197","—To the factor. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",197
"198","1528. Did you bring the roof you had in the previous house to this house, or did you have to buy the wood?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",198
"199","—I brought the roof from the last house. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",199
"200","1529. Sheriff Nicolson.",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",200
"201","—How many crofters are there in the place where you are ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",201
"202","—Eight. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",202
"203","1530. What do they pay?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",203
"204","—One pays less than I do, and the rest pay more. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",204
"205","1531. Professor Mackinnon.",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",205
"206","—You want more land. Is there land about here which you might get?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",206
"207","—Yes, not far off, if we could only get access to it. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",207
"208","1532. Where?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",208
"209","—There is a beautiful glen out there—Glen Uig. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",209
"210","1533. Who occupies it now?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",210
"211","—Mr Urquhart. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",211
"212","1534. Is that the same Mr Urquhart whom we have been hearing about ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",212
"213","—Yes. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",213
"214","1535. Was that place in possession of small tenants before?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",214
"215","—Yes. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",215
"216","1536. How long ago was that?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",216
"217","—Fifteen or sixteen years ago. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",217
"218","1537. Do you know of any people coming from other places into the crofts about here, or were they merely people of the place ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",218
"219","—There were no strange crofters taken in. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",219
"220","1538. So it is just the clearing of the place for a big farm, and the natural increase of the population that has caused the overcrowding?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",220
"221","—No doubt of that. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",221
"222","1539. The Chairman.—Suppose that the proprietor was disposed to allow the people to make new crofts in Glen Uig, and that these were to be made crofts of £10 value, would the crofters here be willing and able to go out to Glen Uig and build houses, and fence the land, and stock it and cultivate it?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",222
"223","—They would be willing enough to do that, but I do not know they would be quite able to do it without help. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",223
"224","1540. If the proprietor was to allow them to do it for the first year at a smaller rent, would they be able to do it?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",224
"225","—Not without help to stock the ground, and if they could but once get the crop out and take food out of it, I believe they would be able to pay on ever after that. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",225
"226","1541. If such crofts were constituted in a new place, do you think it ought to be prohibited to divide them afterwards into half crofts?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",226
"227","—I think it should be prohibited. I believe that such a subdivision has caused a good deal of loss already. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",227
"228","1542, But would not the people themselves press the landlord to be allowed to subdivide, for the sake of their families ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",228
"229","—I believe the crofters would ask the landlord to allow them to do so. I think the landlord should not accede to such wishes. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",229
"230","1543. Then you would approve of the creation of £1 0 crofts, with a prohibition ever afterwards to divide them?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",230
"231","—Yes, I would approve of that. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",231
"232","1544. Would it be better to have them £20 crofts, or do you consider a £10 croft a good sort of croft ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",232
"233","—A £20 croft would be better, and such a croft would be likely to do, and the people of this place are not likely to ask more, for such a croft at such a rent would support their families comfortably. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",233
"234","1545. You stated you were in the habit of earning your subsistence by working for other people. When you work for other people without your horse, how much do you get per day ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",234
"235","—I only work with the horse. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",235
"236","1546. When you work with the horse, how much do you get?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",236
"237","—In some places 5s. a day, and I feed myself. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",237
"238","1547. Do you sometimes work with your horse for the proprietor?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",238
"239","—I never worked for him but one day. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",239
"240","1548. Do you ever work for some tacksman or gentleman?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",240
"241","—No, I may work for the poor people who have no horses themselves. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",241
"242","1549. If you had constant work with your horse at 5s. a day, would you rather earn a subsistence that way, or would you prefer to have a larger piece of land and work on the land for yourself?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",242
"243","—I would rather have the land. I would need the piece of land to euable me to feed the horse. I would prefer the piece of land. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",243
"244","1550. Mr Cameron.",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",244
"245","—What is the smallest size of croft on which you think a family could be maintained all the year round?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",245
"246","—That is according to the place where I would see the croft. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",246
"247","1551. But in your own district, how many cows and how many acres cf arable ground .at the least?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",247
"248","—A croft of 9 or 10 acres, and I would keep six cows on that. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",248
"249","1552. What do you think would be a fair rent for that?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",249
"250","—In my experience in former days, such a croft would be had at £6. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",250
"251","1553. Do you think that would be a fair rent now ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",251
"252","—I do not say that would not be accounted a small rent now-a-days. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",252
"253","1554. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",253
"254","—In the days when that was considered a usual rent, what was the rate of wages ?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",254
"255","—There was not much day's work going on in those days. ",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",255
"256","1555. The Chairman.",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",256
"257","—Have you any other remark you wish to make before you retire?",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",257
"258","—I have nothing more to say further than I have said already—that I know of no likely remedy to improve the condition of the people, but to give them sufficient land to keep their families in comfort, and if they do not get that they will be very much worse than they are. I myself, whatever way I may be able to procure it, have to spend £16 a year on meal from Glasgow.",26,"John Gillies","Skye, Uig",258
