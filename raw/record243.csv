"1","ANGUS GILLIES (35)â€”examined. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",1
"2","13649. The Chairman. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",2
"3","Have you heard what the previous witness has said ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",3
"4","â€”Yes",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",4
"5","13650. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",5
"6","Have you anything else to say?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",6
"7","â€”I have some little addition to make to it. We are complaining a little that our rent has not been ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",7
"8","fixed according to our present possession, but according to what it was when the present laird came into possession of the island. And as you have come to this island to see us, I hope that one change will be effected by it, and that henceforward we shall be provided with a doctor, the want of one being very much felt. We trust that this great boon will be provided for us by Government. In the next place, with regard to the school, we trust that the justice that is being done to the rest of the Highland Isles will be done to this island of St Kilda, so that the children may be taught to speak the English language as well as their mother tongue. We have suffered very much too, by the loss of a large boat which we had for the purpose of conveying us to the mainland, or to the islands, and which was lost in a storm, and we have now only our small skiffs. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",8
"9","13651. Was it a decked boat?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",9
"10","â€”She was not a very large boat, but bigger than those we have, and undecked. Mr Sands collected the money with which that boat was provided for us. We felt the loss of the boat very much after that, when we wrote to Edinburgh, understanding there were funds there of which we were entitled to get the benefit. We did get a boat, but it appears there was not sufficient money to provide us with a boat of the kind we required, and the one we have got is so small as to be of no use, beyond those we have already. That boat was sent us by Mr Menzies of the Highland Society. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",10
"11","13652. Would you like to have a decked boat?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",11
"12","â€”A boat with a deck would be of no use here. A boat would be of no use to us of a greater weight than we could haul up on the shore, at present. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",12
"13","13653. What is the length of keel of the boat you would like ?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",13
"14","â€”Twentyfive feet keel, with nine feet seven inches of breadth in the beam. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",14
"15","13654. Sheriff Nicolson.",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",15
"16","There was some destitution last year in the island ?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",16
"17","â€”We were much worse off last winter and spring than in former years. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",17
"18","13655. What was the cause of that?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",18
"19","â€”The crop was bad, and we ran out of food. The land did not produce of its abundance. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",19
"20","13656. Where did you get help from?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",20
"21","â€”We went in that little boat I have mentioned to the factor at Dunvegan, and he sent over a vessel with meal for us. We could not bring it in the little boat ourselves. I believe there were very few people in any of the Western Islands that would have undertaken the risk we did. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",21
"22","13657. The Chairman.",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",22
"23","As regards the larger boat you want, is it of any use to have half a deck, or a place to keep things dry in the boat?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",23
"24","â€”Oh yes, that would be useful. We would not be the worse of that. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",24
"25","13658. Sheriff Nicolson.",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",25
"26","You state that the factor pays 3s. per Scotch yard for the cloth. Do you ask a higher price from Lowland customers ?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",26
"27","â€”We would need to have a little more from them than from the factor. There is a difference between the landlord and anybody else, because he will take things from us when nobody else",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",27
"28","would. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",28
"29","13659. The Chairman.",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",29
"30","Is there any of the old breed of sheep on the island",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",30
"31","â€”There are some, but they are mostly in possession of the laird. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",31
"32","13660. What is the breed, the wool of which you use for the cloth?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",32
"33","â€” We mix together the white wool and the wool of the black sheep. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",33
"34","13661. Is the wool of the old original sheep much finer?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",34
"35","â€”Some of them ; it is at least as fine. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",35
"36","13662. Professor Mackinnon.",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",36
"37","Where has the proprietor the sheep in the island ?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",37
"38","â€”On the island of Soay. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",38
"39","13663. How many has he got there?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",39
"40","â€”I cannot say positively. No shepherd goes there at present; but I believe there are at least 200. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",40
"41","13664. Where does the man who is in charge of them live?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",41
"42","â€”They are under the charge of the ground officer here, but they are on that island like deer. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",42
"43","13665. Has the proprietor always had that island in his own possession ? ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",43
"44","â€”It has been in the hands of the laird since time immemorial. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",44
"45","13666. Does he send over to shear the sheep ?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",45
"46","â€”Not always. I believe it is about three years since there has been any shearing there. Unless ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",46
"47","you go there at Whitsunday it is no use to go afterwards, for they cast off the wool. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",47
"48","13667. What does he do with the young ones? Does he take them away or sell them ?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",48
"49","â€”They are left there, all mixed together. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",49
"50","13668. Does he never sell any?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",50
"51","â€”He does sometimes. We ourselves are the chief purchasers. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",51
"52","13669. What do you pay for them ?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",52
"53","â€”They are very small, and we don't pay a great price for them. I think we suffer much by the loss of long lines in the stormy weather here. ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",53
"54","13670. Sheriff Nicolson.",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",54
"55","We have had complaints laid before us in Skye, and the other islands we have been in, as to the smallness of the quantity of land that is in the hands of the crofters. Have you any such complaint? â€”We have none, because the proprietor can give us no more than we have except the little island which he has for his sheep.  ",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",55
"56","13671. Do you complain that the rent is too high?",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",56
"57","â€”We have no complaint as to the rent except what we have made already.",243,"Angus Gillies","St Kilda, ",57
