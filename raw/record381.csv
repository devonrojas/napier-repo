"1","EDWARD ARTHUR, Crofter and Fisherman, Whalsay (68)—examined.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",1
"2","22112. Professor Mackinnon.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",2
"3","—Have you any other employment, besides crofter and fisherman?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",3
"4","—No. I have been for some time in the sailor line in my time.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",4
"5","22113. Were you long away as a sailor?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",5
"6","—About a dozen years.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",6
"7","22114. Were you a sailor or common officer? ",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",7
"8","—No, just before the mast.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",8
"9","22115. Have you a paper?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",9
"10","—Yes. 'To the Royal Commissioners for the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",10
"11","—Gentlemen, we your petitioners, humbly state that we the crofters of Whalsay have grievances that we would wish to lay before you, viz., that in many cases our crofts have been reduced, and the rents raised; and in consequence of verbal leases, and no compensation for improvement, the crofters have poor encouragement for making improvements. And also our scathold in many cases has been reduced, and in some cases wholly taken away for sheep farming purposes, and consequently our chance of making a living is very limited; and likewise there is only one shop in the island, and no more being permitted, we find it a .great inconvenience; and other grievances might be personally stated before you. ",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",11
"12","—We are, gentlemen, your humble petitioners, Crofters of Whalsay.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",12
"13","—EDWARD ARTHUR, THOMAS HENDERSON, JAMES ROBSON, representatives for the crofters of Whalsay. 25th June 1883.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",13
"14","22116. You heard the former witness from Whalsay, and what he said about the state of the island?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",14
"15","—Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",15
"16","22117. Do you agree with that so far as it went?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",16
"17","—I quite agree with it.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",17
"18","22118. You say in this paper that, in many cases, your crofts have been reduced?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",18
"19","—Yes, more tenants put on the land than there were there formerly.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",19
"20","22119. When was this done?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",20
"21","—1863, I think.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",21
"22","22120. Mr Bruce of Symbister was living at that time?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",22
"23","—Yes, he was.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",23
"24","22121. He was factor himself at that time?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",24
"25","—The factor had not come in then; the laird was alive.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",25
"26","22122. It was at that time that the crofts wore reduced by other people being sent in among you, and some of your crofts taken and given to those new people?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",26
"27","—Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",27
"28","22123. Where did these people come from?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",28
"29","—From the islands.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",29
"30","22124. They belonged to the place?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",30
"31","—Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",31
"32","22125. Were they all sons of crofters themselves, just in the same place?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",32
"33","—Yes, generally; just the neighbours.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",33
"34","22126. And others came from the place where the new farm was made?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",34
"35","—Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",35
"36","22127. How many families came from where the new farm was made?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",36
"37","—No, none of them came from that.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",37
"38","22128. You say also that the rents were raised?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",38
"39","—Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",39
"40","22129. Was it at that time the rents were raised?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",40
"41","—Yes; when the land was turned up, the rents were raised and the pasture land taken away at the same time.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",41
"42","22130. How much was the rent raised?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",42
"43","—In the first of my time I paid £4;—I paid 25s. a merk, which was about an acre. But for the very same land for which I paid £4, without tithe, thirty years ago, I now pay £6, 10s. with rates. We had no rates at that time, neither poor nor school rates.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",43
"44","22131. And the rates are very high?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",44
"45","—They are £1 now on me; so that really I pay £7 for what I got for £4 thirty years ago.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",45
"46","22132. The boundaries of your croft have not been changed?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",46
"47","—No.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",47
"48","22133. And have the rents of the other crofters in Whalsay been raised in much the same way?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",48
"49","—Yes, the very same.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",49
"50","22134. Verbal leases means that the people only held leases from year to year, I suppose?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",50
"51","—Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",51
"52","22135. And that they could be sent away at forty days' notice?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",52
"53","—Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",53
"54","22136. You think that if they had long leases and compensation for improvement, they would make improvements more than they do?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",54
"55","—Yes, there would then be better encouragement.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",55
"56","22137. I suppose, as a matter of fact, people are not turned away?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",56
"57","—No.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",57
"58","22138. But still you think if they had security that they would not be turned away, they would work better?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",58
"59","—Yes. The principal grievance at the present time is that our rents are far too high. We can raise very few cattle for that money, and the pasture being taken away from us.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",59
"60","22139. The paper says the scathold has been reduced, and in some cases wholly taken away?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",60
"61","—Some of our townships have not one foot of scathold. The cattle never know where the hill is; they must be reduced to the byre the whole season.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",61
"62","22140. The others have some scathold yet?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",62
"63","—Yes; but it is very poor.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",63
"64","22141. Can you tell me how much scathold was added to that sheep farm occupied by Mr Hamilton?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",64
"65","—I could not say.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",65
"66","22142. Is it a large track?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",66
"67","—Yes; Mr Hamilton has by far the best part of the scathold.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",67
"68","22143. Before 1853, did the whole of that stretch of scathold belong to the crofters?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",68
"69","—The whole of it. In my time we had freedom to put our stock on any part of the hill we pleased, and when the scathold was taken off it was a grievous thing for me, for I lost about seventy or eighty head of sheep which were in the property he took off. And after he took it in, my sheep lay outside until they died.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",69
"70","22144. When you had land thirty years ago at £4, 10s., had you plenty of sheep?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",70
"71","—Yes; we had plenty, and freedom. We never thought but that every tenant was to have plenty of freedom of the pasture.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",71
"72","22145. I suppose you may put as much stock as you please upon the scathold, only there is less scathold?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",72
"73","—Yes, but it won't hold them. And in our neighbourhood, where the scathold has been taken off, they must put their animals in upon us, and it is as bad for us as for them.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",73
"74","22146. Your grievance is that the rents have been raised very much, and that the scathold has been reduced upon you?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",74
"75","—Yes, on account of want of sheep we must all get cotton. Once we had warm wool, but now we have nothing to wear but cotton sheetings.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",75
"76","22147. Are the Whalsay people engaged in fishing?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",76
"77","—Yes. ",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",77
"78","22148. What fishing do they follow?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",78
"79","—Ling and herring fishing principally now, since the large boats have come in, but they follow the",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",79
"80","ling fishing in the spring.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",80
"81","22149. Do they fish from the island or from the Outer Skerries?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",81
"82","—The small boats used to go to the Outer Skerries, and in the first of my time we used to fish from the land. We got for ling 3s. 4d., for tusk 2s. 6d., and for cod Is. 6d. per cwt. But then we had our land at 10s. a merk—low land and low fish. Our beef was 14s. per cwt., and our day's work was 10d. and find yourself. But now every man has freedom to fish to the best advantage; but his rent is heavy, and on account of our losing the pasture we are considerably harassed.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",82
"83","22150. Low rents and low prices for fish and beef in the past, and now high rents and high prices for fish and beef—which is the better condition for the crofter to be in?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",83
"84","—I could not say. The people think themselves better off now, on account of the times being more enlightened, and they can see better what they are doing.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",84
"85","22151. I am looking at it rather more in the light of food and clothes. What do you say of the present or the past; were the people more comfortable then than they are now, or are they more comfortable now than they were then?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",85
"86","—We have to buy a great deal of our living now ; the crofts can do very little for us.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",86
"87","22152. But you have more means?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",87
"88","—Yes, the earnings are better.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",88
"89","22153. Which is the best time —when you were young or now?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",89
"90","—It is better now, if we only had fair play with our land and pasture.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",90
"91","22154. You would like to make it better still by having lower rent?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",91
"92","—Yes, and by having use of the pasture as before.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",92
"93","22155. The factor just now is Mr Irvine?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",93
"94","—Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",94
"95","22156. The proprietor is a minor?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",95
"96","—Yes, he is not of age. We have been under the factor for a good many years, and a good man he is. I",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",96
"97","would not like to see him going naked or hungry.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",97
"98","22157. Is it he who has the only shop in the island?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",98
"99","—Yes, Hay & Co.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",99
"100","22158. Is he a member of that firm ?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",100
"101","—Yes, he has been.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",101
"102","22159. And is it to them you give the fish you get at the island?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",102
"103","—Yes, they have a fishing station on the island.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",103
"104","22160. And do the whole population give them fish?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",104
"105","—Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",105
"106","22161. And do the people, considering they have put it down as a grievance, complain that there is only one shop on the island, and no more permitted?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",106
"107","—That is the great evil.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",107
"108","22162. Who has the power of permitting another shop on the island?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",108
"109","—Hay & Co.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",109
"110","22163. And they permit no one but themselves?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",110
"111","—No, he would allow no one to sell but himself, I suppose. The island being four miles perhaps, we send our children to the shop, and they may have to stand there from morning till night—there is a great run of business—and that is the reason why our children, and perhaps ourselves, cannot get served. And likewise, the firm have had all their own way —no opposition.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",111
"112","22164. I suppose you could put up with the delay if you had the advantage another way?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",112
"113","—Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",113
"114","22165. Do you consider the articles in the shop are too dear?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",114
"115","—No, about current prices.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",115
"116","22166. And you get about the same prices for fish?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",116
"117","—Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",117
"118","22167. But, at the same time, you would consider it a greater convenience if there were more than one shop?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",118
"119","—Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",119
"120","22168. And more than one curer too?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",120
"121","—As for the curer, they always make away with all we have to give them.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",121
"122","22169. There is no curer on the island but Mr Hay?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",122
"123","—No. ",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",123
"124","22170. And no one can get there without his permission?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",124
"125","—No; he has the whole; there is no opposition on the island. ",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",125
"126","22171. And there can be none in your island?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",126
"127","—No.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",127
"128","22172. The former witness stated that the boat he had was his own, in part at least, is that a general practice in the place?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",128
"129","—Yes, they try to get the boats to themselves. Messrs Hay & Co. mostly keep a sixth share of the boat, and they supply the fishermen with boats until they can pay; but the interest is very heavy.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",129
"130","22173. Take the old sixern; there is a crew of six in the boat, and each would have a share and Mr Hay another?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",130
"131","—Not in the old sixern, only in the big boats; frequently four or five men hold the sixerns.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",131
"132","22174. And that boat and the fishing material are their own?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",132
"133","—Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",133
"134","22175. And in the new large boats, what is the arrangement?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",134
"135","—Well, so far as they can purchase them they do; but if they cannot do that Messrs Hay & Co. generally supply them on credit, and assist them until they are able to pay.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",135
"136","22176. When a crew tries to purchase a boat, what are the terms upon",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",136
"137","which they are allowed to pay?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",137
"138","—I suppose it is three years' credit that Messrs Hay & Co. give, and they charge, I suppose, 10 per cent, for what is due on the boat, and they dry, and let the fish pay for the boat.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",138
"139","22177. They allow three years' credit, and meanwhile they charge 10 per cent, upon what is not paid?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",139
"140","—I understand so.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",140
"141","22178. But supposing the crew were not able to purchase a boat in three years, what then?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",141
"142","—1 don't know what they do then. I suppose it must stand for debt still, and be charged interest still.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",142
"143","22179. If the crew does not endeavour to purchase a boat, what is the arrangement?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",143
"144","—They fish on the half-catch system.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",144
"145","22180. That is to say the owner owns the boat and material, and keeps them in order, and the crew gets one-half of the fish and the owner the other half?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",145
"146","— Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",146
"147","22181. Is that the rule whether they are engaged in white fishing or herring fishing?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",147
"148","—Yes, in some cases, when they are big boats.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",148
"149","22182. Would it be the same rule of half-catch in the white fishing too?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",149
"150","—Yes. But the material for white fishing is not nearly so expensive as the material for the herring fishing; lines are not so dear as nets.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",150
"151","22183. But still half the fish is charged in the white fishing?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",151
"152","—Yes, I know some of the men who go for shares in boats at half-catch in ling fishing as well as in the herring fishing.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",152
"153","22184. The proprietor gives the boats and lines, and gets half the fish?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",153
"154","—Half the fish.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",154
"155","22185. And if they want to purchase the boat, they get three years to purchase it, and pay 10 per cent, on the capital?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",155
"156","—Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",156
"157","22186. Who fixes the value of the boat and nets?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",157
"158","—The owner of the boat mentions his price for the boat; and as for the nets, we generally know what they cost.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",158
"159","22187. The present holder of the large sheep farm is Mr Hamilton?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",159
"160","—-Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",160
"161","22188. Does he live upon the farm?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",161
"162","—Yes.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",162
"163","22189. Is that the Mr Hamilton we met with as a factor in Unst?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",163
"164","—He is a brother, I think.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",164
"165","22190. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",165
"166","—What things are sold in this shop of Messrs Hay & Co.?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",166
"167","—Groceries of all kinds, and goods as well.—everything.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",167
"168","22191. Are spirits sold?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",168
"169","—No.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",169
"170","22192. Are there any spirits sold in the island?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",170
"171","—No, there is no licence for it. ",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",171
"172","22193. Have you anything more you wish to say ?",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",172
"173","—No.",381,"Edward Arthur","Shetland, Lerwick",173
