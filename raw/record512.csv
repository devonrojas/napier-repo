"40","—10s. per acre.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",40
"41","30242. The dyke must have been enclosing your own land?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",41
"42","—It was between us and the public high road, so as to keep us from straggling beasts.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",42

"45","30244. Were they absolutely refused?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",45
"46","—I believe they were, in respect that they were offered wood and lime free, and then that the premises",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",46
"47","would belong to the proprietor after them.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",47
"48","30245. Do you feel that you are in danger of being removed at any moment ?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",48

"50","30246. Have any of your acquaintances on this property been removed on that account ?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",50
"51","— I cannot mention any case, but our fathers were so slavish in spirit that they had no idea of going against anything that the factor could order, and therefore were quite facile in the factor's hands, and we want to be emancipated.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",51

"57","—About twenty-five years.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",57

"62","30252. Do you think that in twenty years the debt should be extinguished?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",62
"63","—We would be quite willing to pay it for a few years more in order not to defraud anybody of his just right, but we don't believe it should be kept up during all our lifetime. We have now been paying it twenty-seven years, and we believe the debt should now be extinguished.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",63
"64","30253. Do you know how much you pay for money from the bank if you get it?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",64

"68","30255. Do you know if you ever had to pay less interest than a shilling in the pound for it1?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",68
"69","—I never drew money out of the bank for a year's time ; only for a few months at a time.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",69
"70","30256. Had you to pay at a less rate than a shilling in the pound per annum ?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",70
"71","—I think so.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",71
"72","30257. And hadn't you to pay the principal back again at the end?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",72

"76","30259. Have you long complained of the want of the fence between Conchra and Kinnamoine ?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",76
"77","—I have been in this neighbourhood for the last ten years, and never a stob was put up until the last few days, when we believe it was done owing to this Royal Commission coming round.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",77
"78","30260. Did you ever ask for it in the previous ten years?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",78
"79","—Yes, every year, and complained of our loss at the same time.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",79
"80","30261. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",80
"81","—Are you old enough to recollect when the people of Avernish were sent away to America ?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",81
"82","—They were away before I was born.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",82
"83","30262. Have you heard about it ?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",83
"84","—I have.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",84
"85","30263. Did you hear that a great number of the people who were sent away on that occasion died on the passage ?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",85
"86","—Yes, I have; that the most of them were lost, and that those who arrived over safe were badly used",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",86
"87","ever afterwards —were in a bad state.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",87

"89","—Besides the dyke already referred to, the proprietor did a few drains, but beyond that nothing. The people themselves have drained almost every year, and turned out stones.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",89
"90","30265. And created the township, in fact ?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",90
"91","—Yes.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",91
"92","30266. Before then were there any people there at all?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",92
"93","—No, it was not a suitable place for people to be in.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",93
"94","30267. The Chairman.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",94
"95","—Both you and the previous witness have stated that natives of the place do not get employment, but that employment is given by preference to people from the outside ; what do you mean by that ?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",95
"96","—As long as we had local or native factors, we got the preference ; but since that has been changed, and since the factors have been low-country men, they have introduced natives of their own districts into all positions, such as grieves, and the natives have no chance of anything of that sort.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",96
"97","30268. You mean that you get no superior employment, or do you mean that natives are not even engaged as day labourers ?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",97
"98","—We get nothing above a day labourer's appointment or employment; and unless we are very plausible to these low-country officials, we will not get even that.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",98
"99","30269. Have the low-country people brought low-country labourers in ?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",99
"100","—I don't think they have.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",100
"101","30270. What class of people are employed in the great forests and woods which Sir Alexander Matheson has planted ?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",101
"102","—As far as the forests are concerned, I cannot say anything.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",102
"103","30271. I meant the great woods, not the forests?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",103
"104","—In regard to the woods, the natives get employment as day labourers, but in the forest and",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",104
"105","all over it is low-countrymen.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",105
"106","30272. Do you think the factor and ground officer have a prejudice against natives ?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",106
"107","—I think they cannot have any good-will towards us, because my father was never in debt. He died nine years ago, and since then the rent has been regularly paid; and last spring I went for timber to Mr Watson, the local factor, but did not get from him any satisfactory answer.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",107
"108","30273. The proprietor himself is a Highlander; he can have no prejudice against his countrymen. Have you represented this grievance to him ?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",108
"109","—We never come in contact with the proprietor, and we don't know what his intentions towards us are ; but it is quite apparent that those who are in favour have been prospering for years. We don't know whether it is directly through him or his agents ; we cannot say.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",109
"110","30274. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",110
"111","—Are there many of the same name as yourself here ?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",111
"112","—Very few.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",112
"113","30275. Have you been here a long time?",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",113
"114","—My grandfather and father were paying rents here at all events; I don't know before them.",512,"Farquhar Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Balmacara",114
