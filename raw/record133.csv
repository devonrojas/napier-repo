"1","JOHN M'SWAN, Crofter and Fisherman (52)—re-examined.",133,"John Mcswan","Skye, Glendale",1
"2","7166. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",133,"John Mcswan","Skye, Glendale",2
"3","—You gave evidence at Dunvegan?",133,"John Mcswan","Skye, Glendale",3
"4","—Yes, I was asked especially about the practice of the tenant paying the arrears due by his predecessor.",133,"John Mcswan","Skye, Glendale",4
"5","7167. The Chairman.",133,"John Mcswan","Skye, Glendale",5
"6","—Who selected you to appear in place of Donald M'Lean ?",133,"John Mcswan","Skye, Glendale",6
"7","—I was co-delegate with Donald M'Lean.",133,"John Mcswan","Skye, Glendale",7
"8","7168. Have you any written statement from the people of Skiniden?",133,"John Mcswan","Skye, Glendale",8
"9","—No.",133,"John Mcswan","Skye, Glendale",9
"10","7169. Would you make a verbal statement?",133,"John Mcswan","Skye, Glendale",10
"11","—I have not much to say, and I am not going to say much. It is only eleven years since I went to Skiniden, and you know that each  township has marches, and every lot is the same, and the fourth part was taken from the march at Skiniden by the factor who settled it This factor was Norman M'Raild, and his father had it for £80, and the poor people are now paying £88 for it, while the fourth part of the land has been taken away from them.",133,"John Mcswan","Skye, Glendale",11
"12","7170. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",133,"John Mcswan","Skye, Glendale",12
"13","—Who has that fourth part?",133,"John Mcswan","Skye, Glendale",13
"14","—M'Raild himself. Another thing is, that one of the crofters in the place had about half an acre of the best part of his lot taken by M'Raild, who added it to his own holding, while the man is paying still for it. The factor also took from the man the upper part of his lot and gave it to a herd, so that the man has only the middle of his lot, and he can neither go to the hill nor to the sea-shore from his lot without trespassing on somebody else, unless he goes over the rocks. Again, every crofter was promised a ton of seaware. They did not get the half of that, and they were under the necessity of buying sea-ware off M'Leod of M'Leod's property, but last year the sea-ware was ahowed them by Tormore. There is no reason for my saying much. I have seen a great deal of the high-handedness of the landlords and the factors since I remember.",133,"John Mcswan","Skye, Glendale",14
