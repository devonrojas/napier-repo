"40","—Unless we got the rent reduced to a sober rent we cannot hold up to it long. We will soon lose all we have. Our stock has got reduced, and our money has gone. We were hearing of good news from Ireland. We were much inclined to turn rebels ourselves in order to obtain the same benefits. ",47,"John Mackenzie","Skye, Stenscholl",40
"41","2805. Have the people, in consequence of discontent, done any injury to the proprietor or the factor or any other person in authority ?",47,"John Mackenzie","Skye, Stenscholl",41
