"20","31366. Which grievances do you specially refer to?",528,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",20
"21","—Last year about this time the factors went round asking us by authority of the proprietor if we had any grievances. We said that our chief grievance was that we were paying rent to the proprietor for pasture that would not keep a cow. The reason we could not do that is that, when the township was first formed, ten sheep were sent out for each cow; we lost this, and the tenants then got the sheep —those who have still the sheep. When these got the sheep there was no special land reserved for cattle ever since, and the proprietor allotted cow's grass to each of those whom he deprived of the sheep. When the upper tenants got chief control of the sheep they did not reserve any land for the smaller crofters for pasturing their cattle on, and therefore they cannot keep cows at all, because if they take them into their lots then they would have no winter keep for them, or potatoes either.",528,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",21

"25","31368. Was your father a tradesman, or had he any means of living besides his croft?",528,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",25
"26","—No other means.",528,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",26
"27","31369. Were any of those who were deprived of their sheep tradesmen or labourers about the township ?",528,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",27
"28","—One was a crofter, and the rest were at work which they got from the proprietor at the time.",528,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",28
"29","31370. Were they employed on the policies of Inverinet?",528,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",29

"31","31371. And the sheep were taken from you with the intention of classifying the holders there into farmers and labourers ?",528,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",31
