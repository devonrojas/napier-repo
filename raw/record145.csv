"1","MURDO NICOLSON, Crofter and Fisherman, Torrin (18)—examined.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",1
"2","7688. The Chairman.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected a delegate?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",3
"4","—Yes.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",4
"5","7689. Have you a statement to make on the part of those who elected you?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",5
"6","—Yes; we are complaining of the bad land we have, and we have to say that the land does not yield crop. We cannot get more out of the ground than we put into it. It is ten years since I came to this township, and I may say I have not been able to make a boll of meal out of my oat crop since then, neither have I been able to sell any of my own crop.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",6
"7","7690. How many lots are there in the township?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",7
"8","—Three crofts.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",8
"9","7691. How many families?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",9
"10","—Three.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",10
"11","7692. Each family has got a whole croft?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",11
"12","—Yes.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",12
"13","7693. What is the summing? How many cows?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",13
"14","—Two cows and a stirk.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",14
"15","7694. Any sheep?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",15
"16","—Four or five sheep.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",16
"17","7695. What is the rent?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",17
"18","—£5, which is very dear for the bits of ground which we have.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",18
"19","7696. Do the people of Torrin support themselves chiefly by fishing?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",19
"20","—They do their utmost at the fishing, but it will give them enough to do to support themselves by fishing.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",20
"21","7697. Do they get work from the landlord?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",21
"22","—Yes, the man who can work gets it",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",22
"23","7698. What is the day's wages or week's wages from the landlord for common work?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",23
"24","—13s. or 14s. a week, I think. Our township was formerly rented at £10 only, and it is now £15; but it was not Mr Wood who raised the rent—it was Mr Mackay.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",24
"25","7699. Do they suffer from game?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",25
"26","—The game are spoiling us very much.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",26
"27","7700. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",27
"28","—This is Torrin where we are now sitting?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",28
"29","—Yes. There is such an amount of scrub bush growing on our crofts, and we are not allowed to cut it, and we are prevented by it from cultivating our crofts.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",29
"30","7701. Would you like to see all this pretty wood here about cut down?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",30
"31","—The wood is not so pretty as that.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",31
"32","7702. Is it not useful sometimes for different purposes to have a little bit of wood?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",32
"33","—No, it is a source of loss to us every day of the year. The game shelter in the wood and spoil our crop, and we get nothing for it.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",33
"34","7703. Mr Cameron.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",34
"35","—Is your land good enough to grow heavy crops if there were no game?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",35
"36","—There is no doubt it would be considerably better were it not for the game. It is only bad ground at all events. I believe it is as bad as is to be found between the two ends of Raasay.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",36
"37","7704. How many acres have you?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",37
"38","—It is only in bits, but you can guess by the land I sow. I sow four barrels of oats.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",38
"39","7705. I suppose the game don't do any harm to the potatoes?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",39
"40","—The pheasants and rabbits spoil the potatoes on us.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",40
"41","7706. Do rabbits eat potatoes?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",41
"42","—Yes, they do that indeed.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",42
"43","7707. Have you ever estimated the amount of damage done by the game in the year?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",43
"44","—No, I have never estimated it.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",44
"45","7708. What do you think it might come to?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",45
"46","—I cannot guess, but I am not taking so much oats out of the ground as I sow.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",46
"47","7709. Does Mr Wood, the proprietor, ever make it up to the people in any way, either by employment or any other way?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",47
"48","—No doubt, so far as concerns those who are working for him, so much of the damage is made up to them.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",48
"49","7710. Do the people of Torrin not get a share of the work that is going?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",49
"50","—Yes, if they go to it; but I go to the fishing, and I make more at the fishing than I do at Mr Wood's work.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",50
"51","7711. How far are you from the work ?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",51
"52","—Twelve miles. ",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",52
"53","7712. And how far from Mr Wood's farm?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",53
"54","—About two miles. ",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",54
"55","7713. The Chairman.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",55
"56","—Have the crofters ever asked Mr Wood for leave to kill the rabbits on their own crofts?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",56
"57","—He gives us leave to kill the rabbits, but we cannot kill them as the ground is so bad.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",57
"58","7714. Do you ever kill any rabbits?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",58
"59","—Very few.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",59
"60","7715. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",60
"61","—How many barrels of potatoes do you plant?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",61
"62","—About five barrels.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",62
"63","7716. What return do you get for that?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",63
"64","—I may take twenty barrels out of that, if it grows well.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",64
"65","7717. Is that besides the seed or including the seed?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",65
"66","—Including the seed altogether.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",66
"67","7718. Is that in a good year or a bad year, or an average year?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",67
"68","—In a good year.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",68
"69","7719. And you have no return of oats, you say?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",69
"70","—No return of oats.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",70
"71","7720. Ten years ago, when you came to Torrin, where did you come from?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",71
"72","—From Fladda island.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",72
"73","7721. Why did you remove from Fladda?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",73
"74","—Because I had no land there.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",74
"75","7722. You were glad to get a place here?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",75
"76","—Yes, I was glad to get any place rather than be without a place at all.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",76
"77","7723. I suppose your father had land in Fladda?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",77
"78","—Yes, ever since I remember.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",78
"79","7724. Besides the game, what is your other complaint at present?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",79
"80","—The badness of the ground, that we cannot get crop out of it, and that we have to be out of so much money in buying food for ourselves.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",80
"81","7725. But you took it of your own free will ten years ago?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",81
"82","—Yes.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",82
"83","7726. What would you wish now?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",83
"84","—I wish I would get a better place.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",84
"85","7727. How much meal do you buy in the course of the year?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",85
"86","—Not less than twenty bolls.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",86
"87","7728. Do you go to the east coast fishing?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",87
"88","—Yes.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",88
"89","7729. Have you any fishing at home here besides?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",89
"90","—A little in the winter time.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",90
"91","7730. What sized boat have you got?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",91

"96","—We cannot go out in spring to fish at all, with our spring work.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",96

"135","—In Island Fladda there is a very good place for a pier.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",135
"136","7752. But the Torrin and other people here would need to be ferried from Fladda?",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",136
"137","—Fladda would not be far for them getting their boats. It is only about a mile from here.",145,"Murdo Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",137
