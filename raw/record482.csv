"1","ALEXANDER MACGREGOR, Shipwright, Strath of Gairloch (35)—examined.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",1
"2","28712. The Chairman.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",2
"3","—Have you been chosen a delegate by the people of Strath Gairloch ?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",3
"4","—Yes",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",4
"5","28713. What kind of meeting was there of the tenants—how many were present, and how were you elected?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",5
"6","—I cannot tell the number present, but I can tell the way in which the meeting was called.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",6
"7","28714. Relate that, if you please?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",7
"8","—The crofters of the Strath had a preliminary meeting. I was not present at that meeting, but at the second meeting I was present, and one of the members proposed my name as a delegate to appear before your Lordship and the Commissioners.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",8
"9","28715. About how many people were present at the meeting at which you were proposed and chosen? ",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",9
"10","—There might have been thirty or forty.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",10
"11","28716. How many of those may have been heads of families or tenants paying rent ?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",11
"12","—I could not say how many; but I can say that, so far as I know, only three people were present who were not croftere themselves at one time, or sons of crofters. The three exceptions were the chairman, the Rev. Mr Mackenzie, Dr Robertson, and Mr Lamont the schoolmaster.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",12
"13","28717. So that there may have been twenty-five or twenty-six present who were either occupiers paying rent or representing them ?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",13
"14","—Yes.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",14
"15","28718. How many holdings or occupiers are there in the township?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",15
"16","—Maybe about fifty.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",16
"17","28719. You think that about half the people were present, or their representatives ?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",17
"18","—I am not sure that half the people were present; they were not at home to be present.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",18
"19","28720. Are the people away at the fishing just now ?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",19
"20","—It was during the summer fishing season. At present they are at the east coast fishing.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",20
"21","28721. Are you the son of a crofter or tenant?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",21
"22","—Yes.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",22
"23","28722. Is your father alive ?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",23
"24","—No.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",24
"25","28723. Can you tell me why the people didn't choose one of their own number—a tenant occupying land —to represent them ?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",25
"26","—I cannot tell; I never asked an explanation.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",26
"27","28724. You cannot imagine that they had any particular motive?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",27
"28","—I don't know any motive they might have unless that they thought I would just say what they wished.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",28
"29","28725. Were there any strangers at the meeting advising the people, or were their selection and their memorial a spontaneous expression of their own feelings ?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",29
"30","—There were no strangers present.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",30
"31","28726. Have you a written statement to present?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",31
"32","—It is hardly meant as a statement, but it was meant to include the conclusions the meeting came to :",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",32
"33","—' The principal grievances of which the crofters complain are the smallness of their holdings, the insecure manner in which they are held, and that under the present estate regulations they cannot expect any compensation for improvement, as they limit and restrict compensation to such an extent that at the end of twenty years none whatever is granted, a state of things which we consider to be entirely wrong, for we hold that the proprietor has no right to appropriate the value of the tenants improvements after the lapse of any number of years. The hill and pasture has undergone a process of curtailing to gratify the farmers on both sides without any reduction in the rent, but when a piece was taken off the farm of Shieldaig, held by the Marquis of Bristol, the rent was reduced according to valuation. Present rents are too high. The township of Strath paying, including hill rent, estate labour, and rates, something like £230, and if the estate labour was exacted according to estate regulation, the sum would be considerably higher. Estate labour should be entirely abolished. The sea-weed which grows without trouble to anyone is mostly in possession of large farmers who do not require what they have of it, and the crofters not being allowed a sufficient quantity have to buy of them.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",33
"34","28727. What is the name of the particular township?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",34
"35","—Strath of Gairloch.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",35
"36","28728. What is the size of a complete croft ?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",36
"37","—About four acres.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",37
"38","28729. What is the stock—the summing—kept on the hill grazing?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",38
"39","—I wish to state now that so far as I knew it was not that I was able to give the best information that they put me forward. The time was rather short, and I have not the exact totals or the like of that, but I have no doubt it is all made up in the manager's statement. So far as I know the summing is two cows and about sixteen sheep.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",39
"40","28730. Two cows with followers ?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",40
"41","—Yes, and sixteen or twenty sheep.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",41
"42","28731. Any horses?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",42
"43","—Some of them keep horses, but very few.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",43
"44","28732. Is there any restriction with reference to the number of horses kept?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",44
"45","—I am not aware of any restriction.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",45
"46","28733. What is the usual rent of such a croft?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",46
"47","—The rents vary very much—from £1 up to £6.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",47
"48","28734. For the same sort of croft?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",48
"49","—According to the value placed upon them.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",49
"50","28735. According to the quality of the croft?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",50
"51","—Yes.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",51
"52","28736. What can you say is the ordinary or average rent for a whole croft capable of keeping this summing ? What did your own father pay ?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",52
"53","—My father occupied one of the dearest crofts in the Strath—number one croft in the Strath—it came to about £8 or £9.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",53
"54","28737. It may have been also one of the best. What would you consider the average rental for the average quality of croft?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",54
"55","—I did not think of speaking of the average so far as I have found them. I should think some of them are worth about £ 1 an acre —a few may be higher; that would be about £4 a croft—from £4 to £5.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",55
"56","28738. Are there many of these whole crofts subdivided, or are they all held undivided ?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",56
"57","—Very few are subdivided.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",57
"58","28739. When were the present rents fixed?",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",58
"59","—I cannot give the exact number of years ago; but there are two other delegates present from the Strath older than I am, who can give most of the information.",482,"Alexander Macgregor","Ross-shire, Poolewe",59
