"4","—Yes. ",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",4
"5","22158. How many people were there at the election?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",5
"6","—About twenty they spoke to me.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",6
"7","22159. What statement have you to make about Westing?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",7
"8","—Well, there are two things which I would like to mention; there is a want of leases and heavy rents; and these prevent tenants from being so active as they otherwise would be.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",8
"9","22160. Who is your proprietor?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",9
"10","—The land belongs to the estate of Symbister; and Mr William Irvine is factor.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",10
"11","22161. Have you got scathold?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",11
"12","—Yes, we have it yet.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",12
"13","22162. Has any of it been taken away from your holdings?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",13
"14","—Nothing in the parish of South Nesting yet, but only a piece of small ground which was not of much value.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",14
"15","22163. What stock do you keep—how many cows?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",15
"16","—I keep two milk cows—small Shetland cows—and one two-year old quey and one calf.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",16
"17","22161. Ponies?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",17
"18","—Two—a mare and a foal.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",18
"19","22165. Any sheep?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",19
"20","—Yes.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",20
"21","22166. How many?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",21
"22","—I could not tell you. Nine or ten, not exceeding that",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",22
"23","22167. What rent do you pay?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",23
"24","—Exclusive of rates, I pay £1, 10s. now.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",24
"25","22168. How many acres of arable ground have you?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",25
"26","—I suppose about 3½ acres of very bad land. I only have about half an acre of good land; and the animals I have are all of the old Shetland breed—small.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",26
"27","22169. Was your rent ever raised?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",27
"28","—Yes; my rent when I took the croft thirty-two years ago was £3, 11s. 10d., and now, rates and all, it",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",28
"29","costs about £6.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",29
"30","22170. Have you got any road near you?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",30
"31","—No, we have a small bit of branch road from the main road.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",31
"32","22171. How far are you from the main road?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",32
"33","—Between two and three miles, and we have a small bit of a branch road, about half a mile in length, of which we bear the expense ourselves.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",33
"34","22172. Who made that branch road—who paid for it?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",34
"35","—I expect the tenants paid for it.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",35
"36","22173. Did the landlord not do something for it?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",36
"37","—I don't know exactly whether he did any thing or not, but they were always taking your money at rent day, and at last in that way they accumulated some money, and commenced the branch road; for there was a large burn there, and they had to make a road over it.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",37
"38","22474. Did they put a road over it?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",38
"39","—There is a road over it now, which cost, I am informed, £100, but I could not say certainly.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",39
"40","22475. Who paid the £100?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",40
"41","—I t was always collected at the time of rent paying.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",41
"42","22476. There was a little fund formed for it?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",42
"43","—Yes, by the tenants. I do not know whether the landlord put anything into the fund or not.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",43
"44","22477. Perhaps he did?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",44
"45","—Perhaps so; he might have put in a good bit for all I know. There is one thing I complain of, and that is the want of more labour. There is no encouragement to us to labour on our own land, because I can prove that people have broken up their land and brought it under cultivation, and when other people came and offered more money for that croft, the tenant got a letter, saying, 'You must pay us the money offered by this man or be turned off, and I will take the other man;' and it may be that the man who offered was a sluggard, and the other an active man.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",45
"46","22478. Do you know any particular case in which that was done?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",46
"47","—I do. It was done in Nesting of late years, when Mr John Budge was factor in Symbister,",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",47
"48","22479. Who is the factor now?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",48
"49","—Mr William Irvine, of Hay and Co., in Lerwick, and a very fine man he is.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",49
"50","22480. Have you any fishers in your village?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",50
"51","—Not now. There is only myself and my brother alive, and we are past that.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",51
"52","22481. In the township are there any of your neighbours engaged in fishing?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",52
"53","—Yes.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",53
"54","22482. Are they obliged to fish to any particular person?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",54
"55","—I don’t think it. I think they pay their way, but I am not sure. I have no concern with their affairs, and I don't know how their accounts stand. They certainly must have an agent somewhere in town.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",55
"56","22483. Do they fish to Mr Irvine, the factor?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",56
"57","—No, I think they fish to a Scotchman who has a station here.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",57
"58","22484 Does he treat them well.—do you hear any complaints?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",58
"59","—I have heard none yet. They have done much good to Shetland, and I will tell you how. They have raised men's wages. I was for eight years manager of a boat in Lerwick, and I had never above Is. a cran for taking charge.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",59
"60","22485. How much do they get now?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",60
"61","—20s. amongst them.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",61
"62","22486. Do you think that the fishermen are better off now than they used to be when you were young?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",62
"63","—They are very much better paid. I am telling you I took charge of a boat, and only got Is. for each cran I caught, and the other men in the boat got 10d.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",63
"64","22487. And how much would the first and second men get now?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",64
"65","—I think, by their accounts, they only get a £1 per cran.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",65
"66","22488. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",66
"67","—How many men were there in the boat besides yourself?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",67
"68","—Four besides me. We got 4s. 4d. for the cran of herring, and the fish-curers owned the boats and nets, and we caught the fish and laboured for them, and got 4s. 4d. amongst us.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",68
"69","22489. The Chairman.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",69
"70","—In those days when you got Is. and the others 10d., were you obliged to buy all your things from a particular fish-curer ?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",70
"71","—I could buy from any shop; but I had to stop in Lerwick, and pay for boarding out of my earnings.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",71
"72","22490. The fish-curer did not oblige you to buy from his shop?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",72
"73","—No. The principal complaint in Nesting is the want of leases, and heavy rents.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",73
"74","22491. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",74
"75","—Does the croft you have support yourself and family?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",75
"76","—No, but there is only myself and my old wife and two daughters, and we have to buy our food one half the year.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",76
"77","22492. How do you do now when you have given up your fishing?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",77
"78","—I am employed yet, but I am fit for very little. Messrs Hay & Co. employ me as a fish-curer, or else I would be the worse off.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",78
"79","22493. You said the Scottish curers, coming here, did a great deal of good to the country?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",79
"80","—They have not done good to me, but to the fishermen. ",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",80
"81","22494. Are you not a Scotsman yourself?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",81
"82","—Yes, my grandfather belonged to Caithness.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",82
"83","22495. I thought you spoke of Scotsmen as if you belonged to another country?",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",83
"84","—This is a Scotch island, but it is those who have come from the mainland of Scotland who have done good to Shetland. It is my belief that if they had not come, fishermen would have been receiving now the same washes as that current when I was a lad.",391,"Walter Sutherland","Shetland, Lerwick",84
