"3","—Have you got a written statement ?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",3
"4","—Yes.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",4
"5","30638. Are you a delegate?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",5
"6","—Yes.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",6
"7","30639. Were you elected by the people of Duirnish ?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",7
"8","—Yes.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",8
"9","30640. How many heads of families are there paying rent there?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",9
"10","—Thirteen paying rent between lots and half-lots; and there are four besides that who have a lot between them.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",10
"11","30641. Did they all take part in the meeting?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",11
"12","—Yes, or people representing them.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",12
"13","30642. Would you be kind enough to read your statement ?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",13
"14","—The rental of the township of Duirnish when first given to tenants was £120 at that time, in addition to the arable land and grazings for forty-eight cows. They had summer grazings in the neighbourhood of Loch Monar for eighty cows and four horses. The original number of tenants was four, and these subsequently took others in with them. They then sent to the fore-mentioned grazings sixty-eight cows and ten horses, that is two cows less for each horse over the stipulated number of horses. They were first deprived of Portmaneon, which was, and still is, let to tenants at a rental of £ 9 a year. In or about the year 1852 we were deprived of the fore-mentioned summer grazings, and in or about the year 1863 the township was divided into ten lots at a rental of £ 10 each, three of which were made into half-lots. In addition to the arable land each tenant could keep four cows, sixteen sheep, and one horse. (The horses  to be sent to summer grazings) But as the land was being allotted, the factor said that he purposed dividing one lot of the arable land among four of the former tenants who had lost their holdings, with the privilege of keeping one cow each, at a rental of £ 2 each, leaving us under the impression that we were to have a reduction of our reut to the extent of  £ 8 , but instead, leaving only nine lots of the arable land to be made into ten lots, and adding £ 8 a year to the rent of the townships,—this making the rental £ 108 instead of £100, as first agreed upon. There were some improvements made on the place at the time, which we were given to understand we were not to be charged for, as t he work was done, we were told, on account of the poverty of the people, and the work people were principally paid in meal from Balmacara, as it happened to be a bad year. About sixteen years ago we were deprived of a piece of the pasture land for a plantation, and about four years ago we were deprived of another piece for the same purpose, both pieces containing upwards of twenty acres, and for which there was no reduction of rent. About five years ago there was a fence made between us and the proprietors' home farm along the river which had always been the march between us. The fence was made on our side of the water, and encroaching into our land to an extent of an average of twenty yards in width in upwards of a mile in length in the best part of our pasture, for which we got neither compensation nor reduction of rent, unless a march fence made between our arable land and two other townships, for which we quarried and carted in stones, was meant as such. Twelve years ago, finding it a cause of contention that each tenant should have his particular share of sheep, we turned them into a common stock; but after the first-mentioned fence was made, as it locked us from all outlet and left us open to the encroachment of t h e sheep and cattle of the neighbouring townships, our sheep stock of 200 in a short time was reduced to 120, and three years ago we were obliged to sell them. Thirty-one years ago a large portion of the sea-weed which belonged to us was transferred to Achnadarroch, and when the proprietor took the latter place into his own hands, instead of being restored to us, it was given to the Plockton people. We are obliged to get sea-ware wherever we can procure it, having in some cases to go as far as twenty miles by sea for it , as we have not enough of our own to manure a tenth share of our lots. We are obliged to send our horses and young cattle to summer grazings wherever we can get it. For our horses we pay £ 1 for each for four months in the poorest place, and from 2s. 6d. to 3s. a week in a good place. The returns from our crofts doth not exceed three bolls of meal and eight bolls of potatoes a year, that is for each £ 10 lot, and last year we had not enough of seed to sow the ground. Owing to the deterioration and narrow compass of our pasture land, our cows do not give above the half of the former quantity of milk. We desire that our crofts should be   revalued, to get more land at a reasonable rent, and full compensation for all improvements. The difference between the original and the present rent as far as the oldest inhabitant of the place can remember, was caused as follows:",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",14
"15","—Some years after Portmaneon was taken from them there was a reduction of £ 7 , and at the time of",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",15
"16","the potato fadure there was a further reduction of £ 5 in the rental. We, the undersigned tenants of Duirnish, in the parish of Lochalsh, humbly beg to submit the foregoing statement to the favourable consideration of the gentlemen of the Royal Commission; and we beg to submit that it is a great hardship, and that it has a pauperising effect, that while we and other crofters and cottars are crowded on the poorest part of the land, that six large farmers should get the full benefit of the largest and best part of the parish.'",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",16

"94","—No.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",94

"110","—But this fence took the land away.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",110

"121","30694. What harm did that fence do your sheep?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",121
"122","—It kept our cattle and sheep from trespassing.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",122
"123","30695. But it may have saved them sometime from being poinded?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",123
"124","—Yes, but if they had got good grass it would not have done them much harm,",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",124
"125","30696. In fact, you would rather be without the fence because your sheep would trespass upon your neighbour's ground ?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",125
"126","—Yes; it would be better for us and better for the sheep.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",126
"127","30697. Did the sheep from the opposite side of the river ever come and hurt you ?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",127
"128","—There were not many cattle on the proprietor's ground.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",128

"130","—No.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",130
"131","30699. You go on to say that while the fence locked you from that outlet it left you open to the encroachment of the sheep and cattle of the neighbouring townships ?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",131
"132","—Yes, on the other side.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",132
"133","30700. There was no fence between you and the neighbouring township?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",133
"134","—No.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",134

"138","—It would be too expensive.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",138
"139","30703. Did you offer to help to put it up?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",139
"140","—Yes, or to pay interest.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",140
"141","30704. Did you offer to put down the stones and do part of the work?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",141
"142","—We offered to put down the stones if the other townships put down their share.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",142
"143","30705. And did the factor give himself any trouble to arrange that, seeing you and the other tenants might have helped, and that the factor might have helped too perhaps ?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",143
"144","—Not that I know of.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",144
"145","30706. And in fact you remained without a fence ?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",145
"146","—Yea.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",146
"147","30707. Why do their cattle and sheep hurt you more than yours hurt them ?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",147
"148","—Because they have less pasture ground than we have, and they have a heavier stock than we.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",148
"149","30708. Do you pay anything for sea-weed?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",149
"150","—We do.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",150
"151","30709. To whom —to the proprietor ?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",151
"152","—No, to the parties who have it on their shores.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",152
"153","30710. Do you pay to the farmer —to the tacksman?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",153
"154","—There is no tacksman near us who has sea-weed.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",154
"155","30711. How much do you pay?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",155

"157","30712. Have you far to bring it?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",157
"158","—In some cases.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",158
"159","30713. Is it sometimes rough and dangerous to bring it?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",159
"160","—Yes.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",160
"161","30714. Was there ever any accident connected with it?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",161
"162","—Yes, but not a serious accident.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",162
"163","30715. Can you get any sea-ware nearer or more convenient?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",163
"164","—There is not any that we can claim except what we had ourselves, because all those who have it nearer have use for it themselves.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",164
"165","30716. Was the sea-weed which was transported from Archnadarroch sea-weed upon your own shore?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",165
"166","—Yes.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",166

"170","—I cannot say.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",170
"171","30719. Does the other township pay you anything for it ?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",171
"172","—That other township has not got it now. It was given to Plockton by the proprietor.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",172
"173","30720. Is that a long way off?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",173
"174","—No, it adjoins.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",174
"175","30721. Are they quite close to you?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",175
"176","—Yes, they border upon us.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",176
"177","30722. Would they have any sea-weed if they did not get it for you?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",177
"178","—Yes, they had a considerable amount of their own, much more than we had.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",178
"179","30723. You are obliged to send your cattle to summer grazing, you pay £ 1 for each in a poor place ?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",179
"180","—Yes.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",180
"181","30724. You say you consider it very hard that the best ground in the country should be distributed in these large farms, which get the benefit of the largest and best part of the parish; is there any portion of these large farms which march with your township—that lies near to you ?",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",181
"182","— There is the farm of Balmacarra, which lies partly along over borders, and there is also Achnadarroch.",515,"Duncan Mackay","Ross-shire, Balmacara",182
