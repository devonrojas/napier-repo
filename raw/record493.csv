"1","OSGOOD HENRY MACKENZIE, Proprietor and Farmer, Inverewe (41)—examined.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",1
"2","29339. The Chairman.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",2
"3","—The last witness told us that their fishing boats were made in whole or in part of larch wood. I see you have been an extensive planter; have you ever made any estimate of what the value of the wood would be in this country ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",3
"4","—No, I have not. At present I think the price of the wood is very low; much lower than what it was",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",4
"5","some years ago. ",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",5
"6","29340. Is that the case even with larch wood?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",6
"7","—I cannot say. I have never sold any wood; my wood is all young; but I think it is all low.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",7
"8","29341. You have probably planted your wood with a view to ornament ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",8
"9","—Yes; and the trees are quite young.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",9
"10","29342. How do you find the larch thrive ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",10
"11","—It thrives very well in some parts, but I have planted it in rather bad soil. I think, however, planting would do a great deal of good to the country.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",11
"12","29343. And would be eventually profitable?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",12
"13","—I think so.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",13
"14","29344. If you had, at the present time, larch in a state of maturity, would you not find a good market for the sale of the trees ? ",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",14
"15","—I have heard that the market is not good for any kind of wood —not very good.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",15
"16","29345. But is there not a considerable improvement going on in the building of better houses ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",16
"17","—Yes, all the new houses are good compared with what they were.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",17
"18","29346. And should that not create a demand for timber?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",18
"19","—It should.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",19
"20","29347. Have you planted a great deal of hard wood besides larch ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",20
"21","—No, I have planted but little altogether. If I had more money I should like to plant thousands of acres, but it is rather expensive work.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",21
"22","29348. Planting involves not only the employment of labour, but a good deal of permanent labour?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",22
"23","—A great deal. That can be seen in Loch Broom, which will give work for many years, and it has given a good deal of employment in Gairloch for many years.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",23
"24","29349. Is the wood cut on the Gairloch estate used for the domestic purposes of the country as well as for roofing ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",24
"25","—Yes.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",25
"26","29350. Also for fencing?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",26
"27","—Yes, for the posts.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",27
"28","29351. Is fencing increasing now in the country?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",28
"29","—Very much; every body wants fences, even the crofters. ",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",29
"30","29352. So that the demand for stocks for wire fences would alone make a considerable market for the small wood ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",30
"31","—Except when people are using iron entirely. In this wet climate wood soon rots when it is not good.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",31
"32","29353. Are you a sheep farmer ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",32
"33","—I am to a small extent.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",33
"34","29354. What kind of sheep ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",34
"35","—About eight hundred cheviots.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",35
"36","29355. We have heard a great deal about the deterioration of the pasture in this country owing to the extensive use of sheep upon the ground, is that consistent with your experience?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",36
"37","—There is no doubt about it.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",37
"38","29356. What do you attribute that to ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",38
"39","—Because the sheep feed during the day time and go up and lie on the rocks at night and leave the manure there; whereas cattle always lie on the best places at night.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",39
"40","29357. You mix the cattle and sheep ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",40
"41","—Yes, but I have only lately taken to cattle.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",41
"42","29358. Do you find the introduction of cattle both useful to the pasture and profitable in the market ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",42
"43","—It is certainly useful to the pasture, but I don't know that there will be much profit made out of them. ",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",43
"44","29359. What class of cattle do you use ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",44
"45","— Pure West Highland.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",45
"46","29360. Do you find that shorthorn crosses are being introduced here ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",46
"47","—We have not tried them here, but it is a very good cross.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",47
"48","29361. Has anyone tried it?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",48
"49","—Nobody in this parish.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",49
"50","29362. Do you think it is likely to be tried?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",50
"51","—I don't think it is very likely; it is so troublesome to be constantly buying in fresh Highland heifers.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",51
"52","29363. You would not like to see the cross propagate itself?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",52
"53","—I don't think that is a very good system, getting cross bulls to the cross cows. It has not been found good with sheep.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",53
"54","29364. Is there any improvement visible in the crofters' stock ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",54
"55","—A great improvement,",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",55
"56","29365. So that they are getting better prices?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",56
"57","—Yes, four times what they got thirty-five years ago.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",57
"58","29366. Mr Cameron.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",58
"59","—What other employment have the people besides what they obtain on their own crofts in this district—apart from the wood planting ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",59
"60","—Very little indeed.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",60
"61","29367. I suppose, except upon Sir Kenneth's estate and upon his own works, there is, practically, none at all?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",61
"62","—Very little. I give a little, and Mr Bankes used to give a little, but nothing to benefit the people in any way.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",62
"63","29368. Do they get much employment from shooting tenants ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",63
"64","—A good deal, for a short time.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",64
"65","29369. That only lasts while the shooting tenants are here ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",65
"66","—Some of them have gardeners.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",66
"67","29370. Do tourists employ many ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",67
"68","—Yes, a good many are employed by hotel keepers—they are employed as boatmen for the fishermen.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",68
"69","29371. And it gives them a fair market for eggs and poultry?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",69
"70","—Yes, it has raised the prices.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",70
"71","29372. What do they get for eggs at the present time ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",71
"72","—About 6d. a dozen.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",72
"73","29373. And when the cattle were so cheap they got much less I suppose?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",73
"74","—I remember then getting 2d. a dozen.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",74
"75","29374. What do they get for a chicken ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",75
"76","—One shilling.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",76
"77","29375. It was mentioned in the examination of the first witness that",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",77
"78","the manager kept a shop in the village of Strath Gairloch ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",78
"79","—That was a mistake; he certainly did not.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",79
"80","29376. Do you know anything about the privileges which the manager has ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",80
"81","—He has no privilege whatever.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",81
"82","29377. Has anybody on Gairloch estate the right to keep a shop ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",82
"83","—Every one.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",83
"84","29378. The Chairman.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",84
"85","—Is there any of the land in this parish now occupied as a deer forest which would be available for planting trees ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",85
"86","—I don't think there is very much in the parish. There is a great deal of land under sheep available for planting, but I don't think there is any under deer.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",86
"87","29379. You think there is very little forest area?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",87
"88","—Very little of Gairloch or of Kinlochewe.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",88
"89","29380. Are remains of trees found in the bogs and mosses ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",89
"90","—Yes, very large magnificent trees.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",90
"91","29381. Of what kind?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",91
"92","—Almost all Scotch fir, but some oak.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",92
"93","29382. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",93
"94","—You have no crofters yourself?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",94
"95","—No.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",95
"96","29383. What is about the acreage of your estate?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",96
"97","—About 13,000 acres.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",97
"98","29384. Did the whole of it once belong to the Gairloch family ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",98
"99","—None of it, except Kernsery.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",99
"100","29385. To whom did Inverewe belong?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",100
"101","—To Sir George Mackenzie of Coul.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",101
"102","29386. In former times, before it came into your possession, were there not a number of small tenants in it ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",102
"103","—Yes.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",103
"104","29387. Were they removed all at one time or at different times ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",104
"105","—I think there were three sets of tenants removed within the memory of man.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",105
"106","29388. You stated to Lord Napier you thought there was not much of the acreage under deer that would plant, and you immediately added that the bogs were filled with wood ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",106
"107","—Yes.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",107
"108","29389. Is not that a little inconsistent ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",108
"109","—Where there is a great depth of wet peat you would require to remove that or drain it before trees",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",109
"110","would grow, because the trees are mostly on the hard, the peat has grown since.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",110
"111","29390. But that would only apply to peat bogs ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",111
"112","—Yes.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",112
"113","29391. Is there any reason why larches should not grow on the bogs ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",113
"114","—There are a great many hard bits that would grow Scotch fir. I meant to say I did not think the deer forests in Gairloch were suitable —probably from their being on the higher ground and poor soil",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",114
"115","29392. You have been present all day?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",115
"116","—Yes.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",116
"117","29393. And have heard all the people have stated ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",117
"118","—Yes.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",118
"119","29394. Can it be considered that the present position of the crofters in this parish, apart from the earnings they make in the south, is satisfactory?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",119
"120","—No; I don't think so. We are always liable to poverty.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",120
"121","29395. Can you suggest any remedy?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",121
"122","—I should suggest that they should be encouraged to emigrate, and that fishing villages should be made.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",122
"123","29396. Sheriff Nicolson.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",123
"124","—You heard the witness from Laid speak of the want of a harbour for fishermen there; do you think there is, about the coast here, a want of accommodation to encourage fishermen ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",124
"125","—Yes.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",125
"126","29397. Are there any particular places you would consider eligible for the erection of a quay ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",126
"127","—I think Melvaig and Laid.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",127
"128","29398. Would it afford accommodation and protection to a large district of fishermen ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",128
"129","—Yes, there are three large crofter townships there, which might be made much more comfortable if they had a pier.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",129
"130","29399. Could it be done without any great expenditure of money?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",130
"131","—I think the Laid one might, but that at Melvaig would be more costly.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",131
"132","29400. The Chairman.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",132
"133","—Is there any natural reef that could be used as a foundation?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",133
"134","—There is a rock which runs out, and, if there were a little bit put out at right angles from it ; it might make a good breakwater. Laid is about three miles from Aultbea.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",134
"135","29401. Sheriff Nicolson.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",135
"136","—Do you think if a considerable number of the crofters devoted themselves more exclusively to the fishing it would be an advantage to them ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",136
"137","—I think it would. I think they would be better fishers, and the others would be better crofters.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",137
"138","29402. Has the mode of fishing here improved during your experience ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",138
"139","—I should say not very much. There is one place at Isle Horrisdale where the people are more energetic. I don't think they are very energetic at present.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",139
"140","29403. The Chairman.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",140
"141","—Can you suggest any reason for the superior energy of the people there ?",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",141
"142","—It is difficult to say what the reason is. They had very little land there; they were on an island —and had only a bit of potato land, and generally no cow, I think.",493,"Osgood Henry Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",142
