"3","—Have you been freely elected?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",3
"4","—Yes.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",4
"5","7830. How many elected you? How many heads of families took part in the election?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",5
"6","—Nine, and I am the tenth myself.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",6
"7","7831. Will you make a statement to the Commission?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",7
"8","—I have only to say what the rest have said, that it is poverty sent me here —that I am situated on bad ground, and little of it, and too dear, and that for a long time. In my own memory, it was five families who were in the township numbering twenty-nine individuals, and to-day there are ten families and",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",8
"9","eight individuals.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",9

"14","7834. How did the population increase? Was it by natural increase, or by people being brought in from outside ?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",14
"15","—There were not many taken in from other townships; it was the natural increase of the place. They",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",15
"16","were dividing the lots to their sons.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",16
"17","7835. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",17

"20","7836. Have you lived all your days in Kyle Rona?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",20
"21","—Yes, all my days.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",21
"22","7837. We want to find out if you know about the evictions in former times. The first one began in the time of M'Leod himself about forty years ago. Do you recollect that?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",22
"23","—I don't remember the first removing, but I remember Mr Rainy about thirty years ago clearing",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",23
"24","fourteen townships, and he made them into a sheep farm which he had in his own hands.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",24
"25","7838. What became of the people?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",25
"26","—They went to other kingdoms—some to America, some to Australia, and other places that they could think of. Mr Rainy enacted a rule that no one should marry in the island. There was one man there who married in spite of him, and because he did so, he put him out of his father's house, and that man went to a bothy—to a sheep cot. Mr Rainy then came and demolished the sheep cot upon him, and extinguished his fire, and neither friend nor any one else dared give him a night's shelter. He was not allowed entrance into any house.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",26
"27","7839. What was his name?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",27
"28","—John MLeod.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",28
"29","7840. What is the name of the town were his father was?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",29
"30","—Arnish.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",30
"31","7841. Will you give us a rough estimate of the population of the fourteen townships?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",31
"32","—I cannot; there were a great number of people.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",32
"33","7842. Were they hundreds?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",33
"34","—Yes, hundreds, young and old. I am sure there were about one hundred in each of two townships.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",34
"35","7843. Will you name the towns?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",35
"36","—Castle, Screpidale, two Hallaigs, Ceancnock, Leachd, two Fearns, Eyre, Suisinish, Doirredomhain, Mainish.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",36
"37","7844. Was there a good deal of arable land upon these townships?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",37
"38","—They were altogether arable land capable of being ploughed.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",38
"39","7845. Are these now altogether in the proprietor's hands?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",39
"40","—Yes, indeed. The only occupants of that land to-day are rabbits and deer and sheep.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",40
"41","7846. Was this done by Mr Rainy at one time—all these clearings of the fourteen?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",41
"42","—No, not in one year.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",42

"45","7848. Was he long in possession of the property before it commenced?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",45
"46","—I don't remember very well, but I know it was he who evicted the last batch. I am not sure how long he was in possession of the estate before he commenced.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",46
"47","7849. Do you recollect quite well when Raasay belonged to M'Leod?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",47
"48","—Yes,",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",48
"49","7850. Were people put out in his time?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",49
"50","—No, not many.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",50

"54","—They went away abroad, as the rest did.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",54
"55","7853. Do you know whether these people went of their own accord?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",55
"56","—I don't know whether these went of their own accord, but I think that it was not with their own accord.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",56
"57","7854. Do you recollect when the laird of Raasay had some land on the mainland of Skye?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",57
"58","—I don't remember.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",58
"59","7855. Was it sold before your time?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",59
"60","—It was sold before my time.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",60
"61","7856. Did Rainy come in after the M'Leods?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",61
"62","—Yes; he succeeded M'Leod.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",62
"63","7857. Have any people been evicted at any time from Rona?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",63
"64","—No. The people were not living in Rona at first at all. They were sent to Rona.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",64
"65","7858. Did the people out of these fourteen townships that Rainy cleared go of their own accord?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",65
"66","—No, not at all. The people were very sorry to leave at that time. They were weeping and wailing and lamenting. They were taking handfuls of grass that was growing over the graves of their families in the churchyard, as remembrances of their kindred.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",66
"67","7859. Mr Cameron.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",67
"68","—Might that not occur even though the people left of their own free-will, if they were much attached to their kindred?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",68
"69","—No, they were sent away against their will, in spite of them.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",69
"70","7860. How did the ten families come to the place where you resided, whereas there were only  formerly five with twenty-one souls?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",70
"71","—When the son would come to maturity, the father would divide the lot with him.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",71
"72","7861. And the result of that is that the people are now overcrowded?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",72
"73","—Yes. The townships were bad before, but this is spoiling them.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",73
"74","7862. And this was the system Mr Rainy wished to stop by preventing two families living on one croft?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",74
"75","—There were two families on single crofts before Mr Rainy commenced.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",75
"76","7863. Did not Mr Rainy wish to put a stop to that system?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",76
"77","—He was desirous to prevent them from marrying.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",77
"78","7864. But don't you think it would be for the eventual good of the people if, when a man married he left the croft, and went elsewhere, rather than settle on the spot and render each croft too small to yield a living ?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",78
"79","—It would do good to the people if the man who married got land from the landlord, and left his father's holding.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",79
"80","7865. How many families are living on your croft ?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",80

"84","7867. In the same house?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",84
"85","— Yes.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",85
"86","7868. Have you ever given any encouragement to your son to go abroad, and seek his fortune in the world?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",86
"87","—No, I never did.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",87
"88","7869. Is it a convenient thing for two families to live in one small house?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",88
"89","—No, it is not.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",89
"90","7870. Then why don't you try to persuade your son to go?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",90
"91","—He prefers to remain on the land where he was born.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",91
"92","7871. Are you past work, or are you working?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",92
"93","—I would do a little herding —nothing else.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",93
"94","7872. Does your son help you to maintain the croft?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",94
"95","—Yes, it is my son who is working the croft and paying for it.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",95
"96","7873. Has your son got a separate croft?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",96
"97","—Yes.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",97
"98","7874. And lives with his father ?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",98
"99","—Yes.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",99
"100","7875. Have you ever heard from any of the people who were formerly in the island and who went to America or Australia?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",100
"101","—Yes.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",101
"102","7876. How are they getting on there?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",102
"103","—Some are getting on, and some are not.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",103
"104","7877. Was the report you got generally encouraging to other people to go there?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",104
"105","—It was not encouraging. They would be making mention of the colonies, and the climate, and the troubles that were meeting them.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",105
"106","7878. Professor Mackinnon.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",106
"107","—Then your complaint is that the crofts are too small, and the rents too large?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",107
"108","—Yes, and the crofts bad too —small patches of ground between rocks. If you could see it, you would not believe that a man could live upon them.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",108
"109","7879. How do you propose to remedy that state of matters?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",109
"110","—My remedy would be to leave the township in the possession of the number of the families who had it originally, and settle the rest in other townships.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",110
"111","7880. Are there other townships near hand where the rest could settle?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",111
"112","—No, the townships that are near hand and that are neighbouring with us are overcrowded. There are plenty of vacant townships which I have mentioned that have been cleared.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",112
"113","7881. I suppose the people would not object to remove there?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",113
"114","—No, they would not object to that.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",114
"115","7882. Are there four or five people in Kyle-Rona just now who could take the whole place between them?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",115
"116","—Yes.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",116
"117","7883. Could you take a fourth part of it yourself ?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",117
"118","—Yes. There are a few of them who could not do that.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",118
"119","7884. Have you more sons than this one that is in the croft at home with you?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",119
"120","—I have another son who is not married. We are sowing, and we are not reaping. I have not been at the mill for the past two years.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",120
"121","7885. Sheriff Nicolson.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",121
"122","—If you are so badly off as that how could five of you take the place among you?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",122
"123","—Would not the money pay for it which we are spending in buying food supplies?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",123
"124","7886. But where is the money to pay for the stock that would need to be put on it ?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",124
"125","—If we had the land we would get the stock to put on.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",125
"126","7887. How could you stock it?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",126
"127","—I would stock it. We would get hogs cheap to start with.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",127
"128","7888. Is there much difference between the life when you were young and the life now at Kyle-Rona? ",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",128
"129","—Yes, there is.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",129

"131","—It is worse to-day.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",131
"132","7890. Is your food worse?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",132
"133","—Yes, our food at present is scantier and worse than it used to be.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",133
"134","7891. What is your principal food just now?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",134
"135","—Meal and fish.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",135
"136","7892. I suppose you seldom get meat?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",136
"137","—Very seldom.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",137
"138","7893. Was it more plentiful in former times'?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",138
"139","—Yes. When there are many people in the place you must know that the food is scantier.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",139
"140","7894. Have you always plenty of milk for the children?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",140
"141","—No, our calves are dying for want of milk, and the hares and rabbits eat the grass. There is nothing left for the cows on which to produce milk.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",141
"142","7895. Are there no wire fences put round your crofts to protect them from the rabbits?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",142
"143","—No, they are free throughout the township I have seen them on our corn land when the braird was up so thick that you could not count them.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",143
"144","7896. Why don't you get meat out of them by killing them'?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",144
"145","—We cannot catch them.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",145
"146","7897. But you should get traps?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",146
"147","—I cannot get traps either.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",147
"148","7898. Mr Cameron.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",148
"149","—Would you like to eat rabbits?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",149
"150","—I never was accustomed to it.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",150
"151","7899. Do you know what a rabbit is worth in the south?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",151
"152","—No, I don't know.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",152
"153","7900. Sheriff Nicolson.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",153
"154","—Had you better clothes in your youth than they have now?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",154
"155","—Yes, and plenty.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",155
"156","7901. Did they not make all their own clothes?  They had sheep ?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",156
"157","—Yes.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",157
"158","7902. Do you make any of your own clothes still?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",158
"159","—No; we cannot make clothes, we have no sheep.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",159
"160","7903. Do you buy your cloth?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",160
"161","—Yes.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",161
"162","7904. I think I see some men here to-day who have home-made stuff. Are there not some men here who have stuff made by their wives?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",162
"163","—Yes.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",163
"164","7905. Is it better or worse than the Lowland cloth?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",164
"165","—It is very good for us in this place.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",165
"166","7906. The Chairman.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",166
"167","—When the people went away, that you spoke of from all those townships, were they taken away in ships that came here, or did they go from Glasgow or some other place to America?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",167
"168","—They went by steamer to Glasgow.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",168
"169","7907. Did the landlord pay their passage?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",169
"170","—I don't know but he did. He was giving money to some to induce them to go.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",170
"171","7908. Did he provide them with clothes and provisions for the voyage, or anything of that sort?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",171
"172","—No. He may have been giving a little clothes, but it was not in his mind to do them much good at all. He did not care where they went to, so long as they left his estate.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",172
"173","7909. I have seen in an old book that there was once a large place in the middle of the island here which was free to anybody to take their cattle to in summer,—a kind of wild place, for the summer sheilings. Did you ever hear of that?",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",173
"174","—I believe the hill pasture is there yet. That was the case. If the hill pasture was there it is not there now for the people.",148,"Donald Mcleod","Raasay, Torran",174
