"1","MURDO M'LEAN, Crofter, Edinbane (60)—examined. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",1
"2","3589. The Chairman.",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected a delegate by your people?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",3
"4","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",4
"5","3590. How long have you been on your croft ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",5
"6","—Twenty-nine years. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",6
"7","3591. On the same croft?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",7
"8","—Yes. I would like, before I say anything further, that I would have the assurance that no vengeance will be taken on me for anything I say here to-day, for one of the delegates who are here to-day was told by Mr Robertson, the factor, that he must take care what he was to say here to-day. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",8
"9","3592. Who is the factor on the estate to whom you belong?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",9
"10","—Mr Robertson, Grishornish. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",10
"11","3593. Is he here to-day?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",11
"12","—He is not present. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",12
"13","3594. Is there any one present who represents the estate?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",13
"14","—I do not think there is any one here to represent the estate. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",14
"15","3595. The Commissioners are not able to give any guarantee to you for the conduct of the proprietor, and they cannot engage to interfere between you and the proprietor or between you and the law; but we hope and confidently believe that no proprietor will offer any ill-treatment to anybody on account of what is said here to-day. We hope and think that all the proprietors wil follow the example which has been given by Mr M'Donald, and which is to be given by M'Leod to-day, who have stated, or will state, that there is perfect freedom of statement on the part of the witnesses. Now, if you feel you are able to tell the whole truth, you may remain and give evidence; but if you do not feel you are able to tell the whole truth, you may retire ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",15
"16","—I will tell the truth, for the truth will assert itself at any rate. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",16
"17","3596. Now, what statement are you charged to make on the part of those who have elected you a delegate ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",17
"18","— Statements prepared by the Tenants of Edinbane. Our lots are from 6 to 8 acres of arable land. There are about 20 half lots from subdivision. A large piece of the hill has been taken from us called Ben Dhu, and no compensation, given. Several of our lots have been taken down by 1 acre, and no reduction of rents. The proprietor has never done anything for the land. The houses are built and maintained by ourselves. On removal we get compensation for the roof only. We think our rents too high, when so much land has been taken from us, and the rent in many cases raised. They were last raised to give the factor Mr Robertson votes. We are not in arrears. Seven days' work is claimed by Mr Robertson from each lot, and 2s. is taken from us for every day we miss. He likes us to give him the first offer of stock, but he does not fix the prices. A lot is allowed four cows and twenty-four sheep. Four cows are too many for the pasture. The profits from sheep go direct to Mr Robertson for rent. We never touch a penny of the money. The money from our sheep for the rent, instead of being put in the bank for us until Martinmas -when it is due, is kept by Mr Robertson for his own use, and we get no interest from him for it. We cannot utilise fishing for the want of proper boats, &c. Fishing should be distinct from crofting. There were plenty of evictions in Grishornish and Coshletter before the time of the late Mr M'Leod. Many of us have seen the law officers come and strip the roofs in Edinbane, and pour water down on the fires. The people evicted mostly emigrated. They got no compensation. The land is now largely in the hands of Mr Robertson, the factor. We would migrate, not emigrate. No Gaelic is taught at our schooL We would like our children taught to read the Gaelic Bible. The school rates are a shilling. Fees for standard IIL Is. 6d. There are eight paupers on the estate; most of these on Ben-Dhu have come from other places. Several cottars have been removed by the late Mr M'Leod and by Mr Robertson from Grishornish and Coshletter and put upon us. The poor-rates are 8d. Mr Robertson, the factor, has the lands once belonging to us of Kerrol and Ben-Dhu in his own hands. We received no reduction when these lands were taken from us. Mr Robertson keeps a meal-store, and we nearly all deal with him. We are this year already very deep in his books for meal. When Mr Robertson put the money on to our rents, for votes for himself as he said, he promised to make it good to us, but he has never done so, although we protest every year. We can give many other instances of oppression. One man took in a lodger against Mr Robertson's wish. He was fined a £1, and had to pay the £1 for five or six years, and was only pardoned last Martinmas. Another man for selling a stack of corn off the farm, although he had offered it to Mr Robertson several times, and was in sore need of ready money, was punished by having his rent raised from £3, 8s. 5d. to £4, which he still pays. The year before last two men quarreled about the march of their crofts. Mr Robertson ended the quarrel by fining the man with the largest croft 10s. a year on to his rent, and no corresponding reduction to the man with the small croft. In November last the factor put 7s. on to a half lot, with the reason stated, "" I want to make a gentleman of you, and give you a vote."" Mr Robertson has two shares of sheep in the hill, and although we complained, he will not pay for the grazing, and he refuses to let our sheep go over the lands of Kerrol, which is our right in winter, and makes us twice a year build up the dyke that keeps our own sheep out of our own grazings. We have to submit to such things as these, for fear of being evicted. Reforms wanted. More land and fixity of tenure. We cannot improve our lands at present as they will not support our families while we are improving them; but if we had enough of land to keep us on it the whole year round, and if we were made secure against fines and evictions from petty spite of the factor or other causes, we would improve it, and there would be no more heard of destitution in hard years like this. When the credit which this bad year drove us into is settled for, there will not be much of our stock left to us we think. Our delegates will be able to give evidence to all the above. The delegates appointed are MURDO M 'LEAN, NEIL GILLES, KENNETH M 'FIE, EWEN M 'LEA N.' Mr Robertson, Grishornish.",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",18
"19","—I wish to state to the tenants of Edinbane that whatever they state here, no notice of it will be taken by me whatever. They are quite at liberty to say whatever they choose. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",19
"20","3597. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",20
"21","—How many crofters are there in Edinbane ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",21
"22","—Twenty-five whole crofts. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",22
"23","3598. How many of these are subdivided?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",23
"24","—Ten, ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",24
"25","3599. That makes thirty-five families in possession of land ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",25
"26","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",26
"27","3600. Are you speaking for any other townships besides Edinbane ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",27
"28","— Only for Edinbane. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",28
"29","3601. There was another township named Coshletter, are you not speaking for Coshletter?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",29
"30","—There are no tenants there; the landlord has it ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",30
"31","3602. For how long has there been that number of tenants in Edinbane?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",31
"32","— t was at first apportioned out into twenty-five lots. That was long ago. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",32
"33","3603. You have been twenty-nine years a crofter; were they apportioned out when you first remember, twenty-nine years ago ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",33
"34","—They were divided at that time as they are now. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",34
"35","3604. And were they divided long before that time ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",35
"36","—Yes, I cannot tell how long it is since the division was made. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",36
"37","3605. Since how long have ten of those crofts been subdivided ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",37
"38","—A long time before we came to Edinbane. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",38
"39","3606. Then there have been thirty-five families in possession so long as you remember?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",39
"40","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",40
"41","3607. Are there any cottars upon these lands of Edinbane in addition to the thirty-five families holding land ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",41
"42","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",42
"43","3608. What number will there be?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",43
"44","—There are ten, I think. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",44
"45","3609. Have those ten families always been there?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",45
"46","—No. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",46
"47","3610. When did they come? Were they born there, or were they brought in there ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",47
"48","—They were brought in. Most of them were brought in. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",48
"49","3611. Where were they brought in from ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",49
"50","—Most of them from Coshletter and Grishornish. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",50
"51","3612. How many?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",51
"52","—Six were brought in from outside Edinbane. They came from Grishornish and Coshletter, one being from Grishornish. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",52
"53","3613. And four were born in Edinbane?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",53
"54","—Yes. There are four of these six paupers. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",54
"55","3614. How long is it since they were brought in ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",55
"56","—It was in the late proprietor's time; he brought in four of them, and Mr Robertson two. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",56
"57","3615. Will that be twenty years ago ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",57
"58","—It is more than twenty years since Mr M'Leod brought in the four. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",58
"59","3616. Do these cottars get part of their support from the thirty-five families who have land ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",59
"60","—It is the land of the crofters which they have, but it is to Mr Robertson that they pay for all that. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",60
"61","3617. Are the cottars paying rent ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",61
"62","—They are paying 5s. a year. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",62
"63","3618. Do the crofters find it a burden upon them to have those cottars situated among them ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",63
"64","—The crofters will be helping them more than the cottars are a help to them. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",64
"65","3619. But except for these cottars, they are not more confined in their arable land than they were so long ago as your memory recollects ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",65
"66","—No. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",66
"67","3620. Then your principal complaint is that you have not enough of land. Is that so ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",67
"68","—We are complaining of the arable land. One crofter would need to have as much as any three of us have. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",68
"69","3621. Where would you expect to get this additional arable land?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",69
"70","—Is there not plenty of land waste in the Isle of Skye ? Is not the property of M'Leod waste altogether ? There are no more than three crofter townships on the M'Leod estate, and the rest all waste land,—sheep and deer. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",70
"71","3622. On the property of Grishornish is there arable land to be given to them outside of the home farm ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",71
"72","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",72
"73","3623. On Grishornish itself ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",73
"74","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",74
"75","3624. Is that land from which crofters have been removed ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",75
"76","—Yes. It is from Coshletter we were brought, and there are many others in our township who were brought from Coshletter also, because of the sheep. This was when Mr Cameron bought the estate, and made Coshletter into a sheep tack and removed us from it. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",76
"77","3625. Have you any idea how long ago that was ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",77
"78","—Twenty-nine years ago",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",78
"79","3626. But twenty-nine years ago there seem to have been the same number of crofting holders that are there now. What became of the families in Edinbane before tne Coshletter people got possession of the Edinbane crofts ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",79
"80","—Some of them went away to America and others to Australia. You have heard how the law officers were extinguishing their fires and knocking down their houses. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",80
"81","3627. And the Coshletter people went into these knocked-down houses? ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",81
"82","—Yes, when they were removed from Coshletter themselves. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",82
"83","3628. You mentioned that when the houses are built by themselves, and when they are removed, they get compensation only for the roof. Have there been many removed of late years who had compensation given for the roofs of their houses ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",83
"84","—None of late. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",84
"85","3629. How long is it since there have been any such removed ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",85
"86","—Some of them got removings, but were not evicted. One got a removing this year, but was not evicted. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",86
"87","3630. Therefore there is no instance in your recollection of this compensation for the roof ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",87
"88","—I do remember an instance of such compensation. When we ourselves came to Edinbane, we had to pay for the roofs of the houses which we got. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",88
"89","3631. Did you get compensation for the roofs which you left?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",89
"90","—I got a little, but others did not, for the shepherd went to live in the house in which I had been. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",90
"91","3632. Those only whose houses were made use of received compensation for the roof which they left ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",91
"92","—Yes, that is so. Only those whose houses were made use of got compensation. I myself took the roof of my byre and stable with me to Edinbane, for I would not get anything for it. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",92
"93","3633. We are talking of twenty-nine years ago, and you do not remember any similar instance since ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",93
"94","—No. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",94
"95","3634. You mentioned that they paid, in addition to their rent, seven days' labour, or, failing their giving the labour, 2s. a day. On what is the labour employed ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",95
"96","—Reaping or cutting hay or grass. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",96
"97","3635. It is not upon your roads?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",97
"98","—No, it was upon the home farm. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",98
"99","3636. With such a croft of six or eight acres, you have a stock of four cows and twenty-four sheep and no horses ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",99
"100","—Some have horses. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",100
"101","3637. What rent do they pay for that ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",101
"102","—Some of them up to £8. But we have to pay 10s. additional for the wintering of the horse, and we have to take grazing for the horse elsewhere during the summer and autumn. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",102
"103","3638. Then the horse is not included in the rent?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",103
"104","—No. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",104
"105","3639. Setting apart last year, which was exceptional, has the produce of the arable land been diminishing ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",105
"106","—Yes, the land is getting poorer and the crop scantier each year. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",106
"107","3640. What is the cause of that?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",107
"108","—Incessant cultivation for the past seventy years and more. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",108
"109","3611. Have you ever tried leaving out part of it, and seeing whether the remainder would not give a better crop ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",109
"110","—We tried that; the land is very much exhausted. I tried grass in a part of it during the past three years, and I had to give it up. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",110
"111","3642. And you are of opinion that the land is not worth the rent it was originally worth ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",111
"112","—You know the holding is so small, and as part of it cannot be left out of cultivation to enable it to recover, that is rendering it worthless. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",112
"113","3643. But you did not try leaving part of it out ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",113
"114","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",114
"115","3644. And that did not succeed with you ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",115
"116","—-No ; not in grass. Those of course who had only half lots could not leave any part of it out.",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",116
"117","3645. You mentioned that Mr Robertson kept a meal store, and that you dealt with it. Are you bound to deal with Mr Robertson for meal ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",117
"118","—No, but his store is the most convenient.",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",118
"119","3646. It is made a matter of complaint in this statement that they had to deal with Mr Robertson, as I understand ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",119
"120","—Mr Robertson will not be pleased if we go elsewhere to buy. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",120
"121","3647. What are they paying to Mr Robertson for meal ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",121
"122","—Last year 23s. a boll. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",122
"123","3648. At this moment?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",123
"124","—I do not know what the price is this year. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",124
"125","3649. Don't you know the price of the meal when you take it out of the store?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",125
"126","—No. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",126
"127","3650. The price is not fixed when you get it ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",127
"128","—No, ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",128
"129","3651. You said that Mr Robertson asks the first offer of the cattle. Is the price fixed when you give the cattle?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",129
"130","—He offers a price for them, and of course if the party gets a higher offer Mr Robertson does not insist on the beast being sold to him. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",130
"131","3652. Then is it a matter of complaint that Mr Robertson expects the first offer ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",131
"132","—It is the case with the cattle very much as has been stated about the fodder and about the meal ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",132
"133","3653. Do you sell corn to Mr Robertson?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",133
"134","—Yes, sometimes; some of them. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",134
"135","3654. Will the price be fixed when they sell it ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",135
"136","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",136
"137","3655. At the time?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",137
"138","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",138
"139","3656. Then do they sell their cattle to anybody else than Mr Robertson ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",139
"140","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",140
"141","3657. And Mr Robertson does not take vengeance on them for that ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",141
"142","—No. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",142
"143","3658. When do they know what the price of the meal is which they get from the store ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",143
"144","—At the time of payment. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",144
"145","3659. When will that be ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",145
"146","—At Sligachan, about September or Martinmas. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",146
"147","3660. ""When they sell their cattle ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",147
"148","—No; that is the time of payment independently of the times when they realise their stock. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",148
"149","3661. Is the price they have to pay dearer than that at which other meal-dealers in the country are selling it?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",149
"150","—For some time now no other meal-dealers come our way. There used to be vessels with meal ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",150
"151","coming our way, but not since Mr Robertson has been keeping the store himself. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",151
"152","3662. But you know the price at which meal sells at Portree generally ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",152
"153","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",153
"154","3663. Is the price that is paid at Grishornish for meal dearer than the Portree prices ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",154
"155","—- Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",155
"156","3664. What will the difference be between the Portree and Grishornish prices ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",156
"157","—Those who buy in Portree would have to pay carriage for the meal from Portree,—those who would not themselves be able to carry it The meal in Portree was about £1 or 21s. a boll last year. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",157
"158","3665. And you were paying 23s. at Grishornish?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",158
"159","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",159
"160","3666. Is that difference in price reasonable for the transport of the meal for that distance?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",160
"161","—The difference is more than the carriage would be accounting for. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",161
"162","3667. Will the 1s a boll pay for the carriage of the meal from Portree? ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",162
"163","—That is the dearest it will be. Some of it is less than that. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",163
"164","3668. It is mentioned in the paper that there was a fine exacted for selling a stack of corn off the farm?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",164
"165","—The delegate is present from whom the fine was exacted, and he will speak. His name is Kenneth M'Fie. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",165
"166","3669. In regard to the stock, how long has the stock on the hill been on its present footing as to management?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",166
"167","—I cannot say how long it is since the sheep stock was made a joint stock. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",167
"168","3670. Is it long?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",168
"169","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",169
"170","3671. Was it before Mr Robertson became factor?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",170
"171","—It was in the former proprietor's time, when Mr Macdonald of Orde had the management. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",171
"172","3672. Before then each man managed his own sheep for himself?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",172
"173","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",173
"174","3673. Some of them had fewer sheep and some more. How did they get equal shares in the stock to begin with ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",174
"175","—Those who had none or those who had less than their share did their best to buy from outsiders who had more than their summing of sheep. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",175
"176","3674. Now it is likely the people from outside had very little money to buy stock. Who advanced them the money to buy stock ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",176
"177","—They got the money themselves. Those who had not sheep at all Mr Robertson supplied, for which they paid him money. My share was less than eighteen sheep, and I paid £18 for them to Mr Robertson. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",177
"178","3675. Am I to understand you had only six sheep of your own, and that you bought eighteen ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",178
"179","—My family had two lots, and we had only six sheep on one of them. We had a whole share on the other one. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",179
"180","3676. Then the stock does actually belong to the tenant, and is not pledged in any way ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",180
"181","—No, it is not pledged to the landlord or to any other. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",181
"182","3677. How is the stock managed?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",182
"183","—Do the people appoint any person there among themselves to manage the stock ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",183
"184","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",184
"185","3678. How many of them are there?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",185
"186","—Two. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",186
"187","3679. Does the proprietor interfere with the management?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",187
"188","—We are at liberty to sell anything to the value of £10, but beyond £10 we are not at liberty to sell without the consent of Mr Robertson. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",188
"189","3680. There are six hundred sheep in the hill, I understand?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",189
"190","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",190
"191","3681. Twenty-five shares of twenty-four sheep each ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",191
"192","—There are twenty-nine shares. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",192
"193","3682. Twenty-nine whole shares ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",193
"194","—Yes; there are twenty-eight shares, and the shepherd has one share as his wages. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",194
"195","3683. Then two of these shares Mx Robertson has himself?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",195
"196","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",196
"197","3684. That makes twenty-five shares, and one for the shepherd and two for Mr Robertson, which makes twenty-eight These are the whole shares ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",197
"198","—Yes, and the hotel-keeper has half a share, and another man who lives in Kerrol has another half share, making twenty-nine shares altogether. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",198
"199","3685. And there are twenty-four sheep on each share ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",199
"200","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",200
"201","3686. Are they selling lambs or wedders?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",201
"202","—We sell lambs. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",202
"203","3687. How many lambs will you sell in the season?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",203
"204","—Between 100 and 120 tups. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",204
"205","3688. Who has the selling of those lambs?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",205
"206","—We ourselves try to sell them, and Mr Robertson does the same. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",206
"207","3689. And to whom is the money paid?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",207
"208","—If we get the money we hand it to Mr Robertson, and if Mr Robertson gets it he keeps it. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",208
"209","3690. Have you no bank account?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",209
"210","—No. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",210
"211","3691. At what time of the year do you receive payment for your lambs from the purchaser ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",211
"212","—The purchaser pays on delivery. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",212
"213","3692. What is the time of delivery ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",213
"214","—About Lammas is the usual time, or past Lammas. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",214
"215","3693. And Mr Robertson keeps the money till Martinmas?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",215
"216","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",216
"217","3694. And what they complain of is that they miss the interest of the purchase price of the cast for that time",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",217
"218","—Yes, that is what we complain of.(see Appendix A. XVII)",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",218
"219","3695. Do you have a settlement at Martinmas ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",219
"220","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",220
"221","3696. Is there ever a profit upon the stock after paying rent and expenses?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",221
"222","—It will not pay the rent and expenses altogether, but it is helping us to pay the rent very much. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",222
"223","3697. Do you hold more than one croft?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",223
"224","—Yes ; two crofts. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",224
"225","3698. And you are paying £16 of rent?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",225
"226","—I am paying £13. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",226
"227","3699. How much of that rent was paid last Martinmas by your profit off your two shares on the hill?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",227
"228","—£10, 10s. and some pence. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",228
"229","3700. So you had only £2, 10s. to pay besides for the croft?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",229
"230","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",230
"231","3701. Mr Cameron.",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",231
"232","—Is the wool of the old ewes you sell off the farm disposed of in the same way as the lambs ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",232
"233","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",233
"234","3702. That is to say, the money is paid over to Mr Robertson?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",234
"235","— Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",235
"236","3703. Did you sell your wool last year?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",236
"237","—It is the wool-brokers in Glasgow who are buying the wool. They advance the money if it is not sold at Martinmas. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",237
"238","3704. And the old ewes are sold at the same time as the young lambs?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",238
"239","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",239
"240","3705. And they are delivered, I suppose, at the usual time",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",240
"241","—at the end of harvest ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",241
"242","—Yes, except last year. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",242
"243","3706. You say that several of the lots in your township were reduced by one acre ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",243
"244","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",244
"245","3707. Do you know anything of that yourself?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",245
"246","—I know it was taken off them. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",246
"247","3708. Was it not taken off you?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",247
"248","—No. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",248
"249","3709. And it is also stated that no reduction of rent was given in consequence. Was that so ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",249
"250","—Yes no reduction. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",250
"251","3710. What became of that one acre that was taken off?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",251
"252","—It was added to the innkeeper's farm. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",252
"253","3711. How many acres did the innkeeper get in that way?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",253
"254","—I cannot Bay. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",254
"255","3712. Off how many crofts was the one acre taken ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",255
"256","—I do not know, but I think it was taken from three crofts. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",256
"257","3713. I suppose then the three crofts were all contiguous?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",257
"258","—They were all beside one another. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",258
"259","3714. And beside the innkeeper?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",259
"260","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",260
"261","3715. So it came very handy for the innkeeper to get this land?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",261
"262","—Yes, it was just below the main road. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",262
"263","3716. Now, did these crofters ever ask for any reduction of rent ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",263
"264","— They got the first year from a farm in Kerrol for it; more than what was taken from them. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",264
"265","3717. How far is Kerrol away from this place?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",265
"266","—It is just beside us— part of our town. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",266
"267","3718. How long did they retain that land?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",267
"268","—Only one or two years, till Mr Robertson came in, and he took that land away from them, and gave them no reduction. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",268
"269","3719. Are their holdings as they are now, without that acre which was taken off, as good, or better, or worse than the neighbouring holdings ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",269
"270","— Well, they cannot be so well without this taken off them, and nothing got for it, when the rent is the same. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",270
"271","3720. But if the holding was originally much better, and he took off an acre, that might reduce the value of the holding to be equal with the others. Was that so, or did they all start equal ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",271
"272","—These three crofts were equal with the other holdings. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",272
"273","3721. So, in consequence of the reduction of land, they are worse than the other holdings ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",273
"274","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",274
"275","3722. It is stated in your paper that the fishing should be distinct from the crofting. Will you explain what is meant exactly by that?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",275
"276","—If a man had as much land as would support his family all the year round, if he himself will not be about the croft working it, he cannot improve it, and bring it to its utmost cultivation. If a man had as much land as would support his family, the working of the land would keep him going without having to go to fish. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",276
"277","3723. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",277
"278","—Then do you mean a fisherman should be a fisherman purely ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",278
"279","—Yes, unless they would go to fish a little for their families. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",279
"280","3724. Mr Cameron.",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",280
"281","—Then, as I understand, you think crofters should be crofters and fishermen should be fishermen, and that they should not intermix these occupations?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",281
"282","—Yes, but to get as much land as would enable him to support his family comfortably through the year; and if we would get that, I do not believe we would be troubling landlords or other people for help. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",282
"283","3725. But what do you mean by those who are to occupy themselves with fishing ? Do you mean the fishermen are to have no land ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",283
"284","—I do not think that. I think every fisherman ought to have a little land along with his house. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",284
"285","3726. Then do you think the fishermen should not have as much land as the crofter Ì How much land ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",285
"286","—I think the fisherman would not be able to manage so much as the crofter, as he would not be able to devote his time to fishing. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",286
"287","3727. Then you think there should be two classes—one of crofters with large crofts, and one of fishermen with small crofts?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",287
"288","—Yes. The fishermen with us have not very large boats, and they are only fishing as much as will keep their families going, and therefore, I think, so far as we are concerned, we should have the land, as much as would keep our families in comfort. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",288
"289","3728. Are you not aware that one of the great grievances through the whole of Skye, as generally understood, is that the very system which you speak of as a good system, has been carried out, namely, that the crofters have been moved from crofts where they have been comfortable, and put down on small crofts near the sea, where they have been expected to make up their livelihood by fishing?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",289
"290","—And is it not that which has spoiled them, and made them poor people Ì They were taken from other parts and packed by the sea-shore, and the best part of the land under sheep. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",290
"291","3729. Does that not agree with what you said just now, that crofters should be crofters, and that fishermen should have smaller holdings, and occupy themselves with fishing?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",291
"292","—I do not mean that such a fisherman ought to be among us at all. I do not mean that among us there should be people placed on small crofts, in order that they might devote themselves to fishing. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",292
"293","3730. Will you give in your own words your ideas how fishing should be prosecuted ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",293
"294","—I myself have got two nets at home, and last year I did not fish more than a barrel of herring with them, and in that way, how could I depend upon fishing ? I am only losing my time with it. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",294
"295","3731. Then, will you say distinctly that fishing is altogether a mistake for the people in this district, and that it should be discontinued ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",295
"296","—I know that a fisherman without land would not do in our place. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",296
"297","3732. It is mentioned in that statement that one of the crofters took in a lodger, and was fined for it. What was the lodger?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",297
"298","—He was a hawker—a rag collector ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",298
"299","3733. What are the farms and deer forests you alluded to as being Macleod's property which were waste ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",299
"300","—Minginish entirely, the parish of Bracadale altogether, except a little that was given to the cottars in Struan. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",300
"301","3734. Would all those large farms be suitable for crofters, or did you only mean a proportion of them?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",301
"302","—Yes, it is there that the crofters would get justice. The best land in Skye is there. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",302
"303","3735. Do you think those two farms of Glenbrittle and Talisker would make suitable crofting farms ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",303
"304","—Was it not crofters that were on them before ? It is there that crofters would thrive—good strong land, if it were taken under cultivation now. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",304
"305","3736. And what would they do with the higher part of the land ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",305
"306","— They would stock it with sheep and cattle. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",306
"307","3737. Have they got capital in order to do that?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",307
"308","—If they got good land it would be easier for them to get money. If they were located on the land in such a way as that neither landlord nor anybody else would interfere with them, they might get assistance from Government to buy the land. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",308
"309","3738. Have you any idea of the value of the sheep stock upon these two farms I have mentioned, at the present time ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",309
"310","—No. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",310
"311","3739. What is the deer forest you allude to as being wasted?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",311
"312","—The Cuchullins. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",312
"313","3740. Do you know yourself where the deer forest is?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",313
"314","—In the Cuchullins and Minginish. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",314
"315","3741. Would the land where the deer are be suitable for crofters to cultivate ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",315
"316","—Not in the upper parts of the mountains. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",316
"317","3742. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",317
"318","—Was the paper you have handed in composed by the people themselves on the spot ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",318
"319","—Yes, it was made up in Edinbane. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",319
"320","3743. Is there enough of land for the crofters upon the estate of Grishornish according to their views, apart from the landlord's own farm, that could be given back to them ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",320
"321","—Yes, but M'Leod of M'Leod has much better land, if we could only get it. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",321
"322","3744. Will you explain now about the votes; do you mean Parliamentary votes, or what votes ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",322
"323","—School board votes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",323
"324","3745. One of the complaints is that Gaelic is not taught in the school. Why is that ? Does the school board prevent it ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",324
"325","—I don't know, but the schoolmaster is a south country man, who has no Gaelic. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",325
"326","3746. Who is the chairman of the board ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",326
"327","—I don't know. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",327
"328","3747. Is Mr Robertson one of the members of the board ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",328
"329","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",329
"330","3748. Can he speak Gaelic?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",330
"331","—He does not speak it, at any rate. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",331
"332","3749. Is he a Skye man ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",332
"333","—No. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",333
"334","3750. Why does Mr Robertson wish to get from the people the first offer of their cattle, and wish them to go to his store ? Does he do so from philanthropic motives, or for the purpose of making a profit himself? ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",334
"335","—To make profit to himself, no doubt. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",335
"336","3751. Do you wish to abolish the two things? Would the people rather be free of this first offer, and free of the store ? Would you prefer that the store was not there ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",336
"337","—We were, at the beginning of this spring, very much in straits for meal, and we thought that he should have had a constant supply of meal in his store, and were it not for the supply of meal that Dr Fraser got, there would some of us have perished. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",337
"338","3752. Then, there was not meal in the store all the year round ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",338
"339","— There was no meal at that time. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",339
"340","3753. You state that sometimes Mr Robertson sells the sheep for them, and sometimes they sell them themselves, and when they sell they give the money to Mr Robertson. When he sells for them about Lammas, does he tell them, when he sells, what he gets, or do they know nothing about it till Martinmas ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",340
"341","—He tells us the price at the time. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",341
"342","3754. And the only complaint they have about that is the loss of the interest ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",342
"343","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",343
"344","3755. Is the present proprietor of age?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",344
"345","—Not yet. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",345
"346","3756. How long is it since the late Grishornish died ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",346
"347","—I cannot exactly say. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",347
"348","3757. Is it ten years ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",348
"349","—It is more than that. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",349
"350","3758. Has Mr Robertson been the factor all the timel",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",350
"351","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",351
"352","3759. Was the late Mr M'Leod of Grishornish a good landlord ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",352
"353","—We were putting up with him as he was. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",353
"354","3760. Then who was his predecessor? Was it a man commonly called Corriechoilie ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",354
"355","—Yes. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",355
"356","3761. How long was he proprietor?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",356
"357","—A few years. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",357
"358","3762. Who had it before him?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",358
"359","—Mrs Murray, the widow of Mr Murray of Grishornish, and it was left with her in liferent. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",359
"360","3763. Do you recollect when it belonged to the family of M'Leod ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",360
"361","—I remember when M'Leod of M'Leod bought Grishornish. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",361
"362","3764. But when it originally parted from the family ?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",362
"363","—M'Leod sold it shortly before he became bankrupt. ",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",363
"364","3765. Have you any idea how long ago the first parting from the family took place?",61,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Dunvegan",364
