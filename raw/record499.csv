"5","—'Statement by the Western Aligin Crofters:",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",5
"6","We possess one and a half acres of arable land for which in previous years we paid £ 4 rental, but this year it has been reduced £ 1 . We are uncertain, however, whether this reduction is to be permanent or not. When Mr M'Barnet bought the estate we possessed individually fifteen sheep, five cattle, and a stirk, for which each of the twenty crofters then residing iu our township paid £5 rental. The trustees of the younger M'Barnet, however, deprived us of the privileges then enjoyed by us. This they did, we think, by imposition. They promised that if we parted with our sheep stock, they would pay us £ 50 annually for the use of the grazing, but this they paid only for one year. Matters then  went from bad to worse. One hardship was endured by us after another. No sooner did we lose our stock of sheep than we were deprived of grazing for our cattle. Previously we had, as already stated, five cattle in addition to the stirk, but now we were not allowed to keep any save one cow, the calf of which we were forced to sell or kill before it was six months old. It is only fair to add that our rental was reduced from £5 to £ 3 , but notwithstanding this reduction we were in poorer circumstances than when we possessed the grazing. Our grievances were further increased by the fact that we were at the same time deprived of about one-fourth part of the arable land for the benefit of the proprietor's shepherds. In consequence of all this we gradually fell into arrears as we possessed nothing that we could sell save the one calf. Such were our circumstances when Mr Darroch bought the estate, who since his residing among us has showed us several acts of kindness with a view to better our condition. His first act was to pay our arrears to Mr M'Barnet's trustees, lest we should have to part with the only cow we then had, he himself giving us work by which we could partly repay him. If at any time we were unable to pay our annual rent, he never forced us to do so, but always gave us time until circumstances so changed as that we were able to pay him. Without any solicitation on our part, the calf which we were formerly compelled to part with when six months old he allowed us to keep until it was one year old. This year he further extended our privileges by allowing us to graze another additional head of cattle. We consider, however, that our rental is high when we take into consideration the quality of our land; and that our condition would be improved if we possessed more land, and got an opportunity of keeping additional stock. The above is written out by me as reported by the people themselves, JOHN M'NEIL",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",6
"7","29658. According to this paper you have nothing whatever to complain of except that you have not so much land as you would like, and that you pay more than you would like ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",7
"8","—That is all; we have no further complaint.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",8
"9","29659. Is the arable land that you have good?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",9
"10","—No, it is very bad.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",10
"11","29660. Do you get good crops out of it ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",11
"12","—The crops look better than the land; this year the crops look very well, but the land is very bad.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",12
"13","29661. Do you consider £ 3 too high a rent for what you have?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",13
"14","—Yes, I think it is.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",14
"15","29662. What would you consider a proper rent yourself?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",15
"16","—Between 50s. and £ 3 .",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",16
"17","29663. Would you like to get a man to value it ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",17
"18","—Yes.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",18
"19","29664. Would you take your chance?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",19
"20","—Yes, we would be very glad to do that.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",20
"21","29665. What would you say if he said it was worth £5 —would you be pleased then ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",21
"22","—Yes, we would be quite pleased with what he said; but no man of conscience would value it at that.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",22
"23","29666. Is there any better arable ground for you that you could get?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",23
"24","—There is very little available arable ground, almost all the possible arable ground is cultivated.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",24
"25","29667. What would you like Mr Darroch to do for you?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",25
"26","—The proprietor was doing very well towards us; he was doing what he could. He cannot give us what he has not; but we consider the land dear. We would like very much if we would get additional grazing.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",26
"27","29668. Is there more grazing you could easily get if he pleased to give it to you ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",27
"28","—Yes, there is what would be of great service to us.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",28
"29","29669. How is it occupied?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",29
"30","—There is a hill upon which we have cattle, but it is not settled upon us but for the year, and we would like to have it permanent so that we could stock it.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",30
"31","29670. Who had it before you got it?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",31
"32","—My father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather had that hill.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",32
"33","29671. Is there anybody else who is likely to get it if it is not given to you ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",33
"34","—No, we are not afraid, but we don't know anything about it. We know we are in want of it",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",34
"35","29672. Are you not allowed to put any stock upon it except cattle ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",35
"36","—We do not get it for that purpose, and perhaps there were some among us who could not provide the other stock even if we got permission; but if we did get permission we would endeavour to stock it as we were able.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",36
"37","29673. With sheep as well as with cattle?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",37

"39","29674. The Chairman.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",39
"40","—You said you got leave to keep an additional beast—did you get additional land to feed the beast ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",40
"41","—Yes, we got this year that hill that I have spoken of.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",41
"42","29675. Do you pay additional rent?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",42
"43","—We were not told that we would have to pay rent; perhaps we may have to pay a little additional rent, we do not know. But if we had an additional cow to our summing we had to work ten days' labour for it.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",43
"44","29676. How do you get the winter feeding for an additional beast?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",44
"45","—We buy here and there if we do not have it ourselves.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",45
"46","29677. How much will it cost you in winter for the food of the additional beast ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",46
"47","—40s. to 50s.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",47
"48","29678. Would you rather pay for an additional cow in ten days' labour or give £ 1 , 5s. in money ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",48
"49","—Ten day's work ; that would be easier than to pay 25 s. a year.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",49
"50","29679. What season would the proprietor take the work in ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",50
"51","—I think we would afford to work; he is not hard upon us in that respect.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",51
"52","29680. What sort of work is it—is it work on the roads for your own good, and fences —or work for the proprietor's good ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",52
"53","—The last bit of work we did was for our own good; making a road for ourselves.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",53
"54","29681. Was that the road to your own township?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",54

"62","29685. Who has to keep it up—are you to do so or the proprietor?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",62
"63","—We keep it up at the proprietor's expense.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",63
"64","29686. If the proprietor offered to help you to make a cart road would that be a great convenience to you ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",64
"65","—Yes, it would be a very great convenience, but we have neither cart nor horse.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",65
"66","29687. But if the proprietor offered to make a cart road would you help with your own labour ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",66
"67","—What could we do with a horse and cart, what would be the use of a cart without a horse. .",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",67
"68","29688. If the road was made you might begin to buy horses and carts ? ",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",68
"69","—Yes, if we could afford it, we might. ",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",69

"81","29694. Did you hear what the previous delegate said about a number of people being removed from one side of the river?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",81
"82","—I could not understand him supposing I did hear him.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",82

"94","—Mackenzie.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",94
"95","29701. Was it poverty which took them away—were they starved out?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",95
"96","—What else, but that they could not remain after the land was taken from them.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",96

"98","—Yes; every benefit we ever got has been got since he came.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",98
"99","29703. Was it a bad day for Torridon when the M'Barnets got it ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",99
"100","—M'Barnet was not hard with respect to the rents, but he was not laying out money upon improvements",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",100
"101","29704. Was he a popular proprietor?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",101
"102","—Yes, I am not aware there was any cause of his being unpopular.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",102
"103","29705. Was there any cause for your being dissatisfied with him?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",103
"104","—He put sheep upon the place and kept it in his own hands, and that was the beginning of depriving us of our hill pasture and stock.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",104

"109","29708. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",109
"110","—Have you had any sheep since Mr Darroch came there ?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",110

"112","29709. And that was the reason you had to part with the sheep?",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",112
"113","—Yes. It was myself that purchased them, and the stock was deteriorated, and we were getting afraid that the money that was invested in them could not be realized, and so we sold them.",499,"Duncan Beaton","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",113
