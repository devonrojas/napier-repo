"6","—What we chiefly complain of is that in 1860 a share of our land was taken from us and given to the man who saj-s he is satisfied. In consequence of this we lost the benefit of our cattle. Fifteen years ago the place was divided into lots. Rent was laid upon our sheep, upon our lots, and upon our cattle, amounting in all to £13, 10s. Some lots, however, amounted to £17. Three years ago one of the tenants gave up his lot, and the others took his share between them, which brought our average rent to £15 and the highest over £18. In 1881 the rent was reduced, so that now the lowest pays £13,10s. and the highest £16. The place won't keep the summing here without a good deal of extra expense. Last year the village was out of pocket in this way £5, 12s., which brought the rent up to over £19 for the stock I am allowed to keep. We have also further to pay for the wintering of our hoggs, which  amounted last year to the  sum of £33 for the township, or £5, 10s. per lot.",529,"Alexander Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",6
