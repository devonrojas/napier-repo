"1","DONALD M'LENNAN, Ground Officer on the Estate of Lochcarron (58)—examined.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",1
"2","29795. The Chairman.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",2
"3","—Did you hear what the previous witness said with reference to the alleged depredations of deer upon a particular township?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",3
"4","—Yes.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",4
"5","29796. And the want of a fence round it?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",5
"6","—Yes.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",6
"7","29797. Would you explain to me what is the nature of the injury, if any, the deer cause to the township ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",7
"8","—I believe the evidence as given is quite correct as to the destruction of crop; there is no denying that.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",8
"9","29798. How long have you been ground officer upon this property?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",9
"10","—Nearly seventeen years.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",10
"11","29799. What measures were taken in previous times to protect the crofters against the deer ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",11
"12","—None for that township.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",12
"13","29800. What is the particular reason why protection was given to other townships and not to this particular township ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",13
"14","—I could not tell you ; but I know there was no provision made for fencing for that township. The houses are dotted throughout the arable land here and there, and they could watch them out of their beds.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",14
"15","29801. So that they could watch them without trouble out of their beds—they could not watch them when sleeping ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",15
"16","—They had all families, and one would be out and another in.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",16
"17","29802. Then you think it is a reasonable thing that crofters should sit up or keep awake to protect crops ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",17
"18","—No, I do not.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",18
"19","29803. If any injury was committed by deer was anything done to compensate the people?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",19
"20","—Nothing.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",20
"21","29804. Or to help them to sit up at night?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",21
"22","—Nothing.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",22
"23","29805. Then what do you think ought to be done in a case of this 6ort ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",23
"24","—Well, I think the crops ought to be protected wherever they are.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",24
"25","29806. But supposing the proprietor was inclined to assist to protect the crops, what sort of fence do you think could be put up ? ",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",25
"26","—We generally go in for iron fences entirely.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",26
"27","29807. And if a fence was put up in what respect do you think the crofters could co-operate with the proprietor, and save him some part of the expense ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",27
"28","—I am afraid they could not do much in that township. They might provide the stones and put them on the ground, which would be so much.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",28
"29","29808. Help to transport the material to the ground ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",29
"30","—Yes.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",30
"31","29809. Do you think the crofters would be glad to do that ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",31
"32","—I think they would do that. I think I would take my chance of that.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",32
"33","29810. You seem to me to be willing that anything reasonable should be done for the satisfaction of those crofters ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",33
"34","—Certainly; and I should not like to see the poor men's crop lost.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",34
"35","29811. Mr Cameron.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",35
"36","—Did you ever suggest to the former proprietor what you now seem willing to admit was a reasonable thing?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",36
"37","—I have spoken of it occasionally, but perhaps I never went so far as I ought to have gone.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",37
"38","29812. Was the last witness correct in his estimate of the distance the fence would require to be made?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",38
"39","—I don't think it is quite so long as a mile; I think it is under a mile.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",39
"40","29813. On and off you agree with him?--I never stepped it, but judging by the appearance of the ground it is under a mile. ",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",40
"41","29814. Is it tolerably easy of access —would it be expensive?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",41
"42","—About Is. 6d. a yard.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",42
"43","29815. A 6-foot fence?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",43
"44","—We do not generally make them so high as that—may be 4½ .",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",44
"45","29816. Is it your experience that a 4½  fence is of use?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",45
"46","—Yes, if you keep it a good piece away from the crop.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",46
"47","29817. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",47
"48","—It is stated here that the tenants of this township of Deruner offered to fence themselves if they were promised compensation in case of leaving; are you aware of that ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",48
"49","—I never heard of that, and I do not believe they could do it.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",49
"50","29818. Has anything been done of late in the way of fencing the townships?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",50
"51","—We are fencing here now.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",51
"52","29819. Have you done much?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",52
"53","—We are going on. We have a mile on hand behind the church here just now to protect the crofters' crops.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",53
"54","29820. At Shieldaig ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",54
"55","—-No, further down the coast.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",55
"56","29821. The first witness examined to-day gave an account of the ejection of the feuars at Shieldaig, were you present when he gave that account ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",56
"57","—I heard his evidence, but I was not on the property when that took place. I have seen no evictions in Shieldaig since I came.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",57
"58","29822. Do you know if any such evictions took place, have you heard of them ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",58
"59","—I have heard of him being evicted by the late Duke of Leeds and a widow also.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",59
"60","29823. Do you know on what grounds they were evicted?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",60
"61","—I cannot go into that; it was not in my day, and I never could get right at the bottom of it. There were some reasons I believe, but I could not get at them.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",61
"62","29824. The Chairman.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",62
"63","—Is there any remark you wish spontaneously to make in connection with any evidence you heard to-day?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",63
"64","—Well, I thought the remarks about the one hundred and twenty. sheep were extravagant. I do not believe, from the extent of hill ground taken from that township, that those five tenants could maintain or support one hundred and twenty sheep. And the other township he spoke of, Kinloch, when the ground was cleared there was only one tenant there; and I believe he is present here to-day. The rent of that township was, I think, £ 10 or £11. That tenant went to the other side of the property of Lochcarron where he got three lots instead of the holding he had here. In point of fact, there was only the township of Deruner cleared of sheep. The village of Shieldaig had a piece of ground called Glen Shieldaig, and they were subtenants of Mr Scott, who had the large sheep farm.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",64
"65","29825. What the delegate said in answer to my questions was this, that about thirty families had been deprived of their hill pasture when the hill pasture was taken away; or at any rate, that thirty families had, at a previous period, a share of it ; do you think there ever were as many as thirty families at any period having contemporaneously a share in that hill pasture?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",65
"66","—I think the first man who was called here to-day said there were only about nine or ten tenants in the village of Shieldaig. They were subtenants of this Mr Scott at the time of the clearances for sheep. They had a stretch of Glen Shieldaig, and when Mr Scott's lease expired their term of grazing expired, so far as I can understand. Well, that was about nine; and then one at Kinloch and five at Deruner is fourteen. He also talked of Camusfail where there were four. I never saw but two there; and now there is only one; and that one has much privilege as the four had before; and we inclosed this place with a",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",66
"67","ring fence.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",67
"68","29826. So that there would not be above fourteen or fifteen put out ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",68
"69","—I could not make it more than that.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",69
"70","29827. However constituted or let, what do you think the value of this deer forest would be as a deer forest?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",70
"71","—It is in a good situation—I should say £1000.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",71
"72","29828. But that would include dwelling-house and other things?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",72
"73","—Certainly, everything—garden, fishings, and all.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",73
"74","29829. What would the value of the grazings be?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",74
"75","—Mr Miller's rent would be about £300 odds.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",75
"76","29830. Mr Cameron.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",76
"77","—What is it called in the Valuation Roll ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",77
"78","—Glen Shieldaig.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",78
"79","29831. Is there none in Lochcarron?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",79
"80","—No.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",80
"81","29833. The Chairman.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",81
"82","—Is there anything else you would like to say?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",82
"83","—No.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",83
"84","29833. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",84
"85","—How long have you been manager?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",85
"86","—Seventeen years.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",86
"87","29834. Do you think you know, or are qualified to give as good an opinion, as to the number of crofters who were deprived of the pasture, as a man who has been here all his days; he stated thirty, and you stated eighteen or nineteen ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",87
"88","—He ought to know, but I am afraid he is not quite sure of it himself.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",88
"89","29835. You won't put your opinion against his?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",89
"90","—No.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",90
"91","29836. You stated there were no evictions in Shieldaig in your time; were there any other evictions or attempted evictions in Lochcarron in your time?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",91
"92","—Oh, yes.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",92
"93","29837. Do you know a family of the name of Maclean ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",93
"94","—I know several Macleans. Perhaps you allude to a case in Slumbae.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",94
"95","29838. Is there an old man eighty-two years of age still living at Slumbae ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",95
"96","—I believe he is still living.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",96
"97","29839. Was there an attempt made to evict him ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",97
"98","—Yes.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",98
"99","29840. At whose instance ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",99
"100","—At the proprietor's.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",100
"101","29841. Had you anything to do with it ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",101
"102","—Not directly.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",102
"103","29842. What had you to do with it indirectly ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",103
"104","—A misunderstanding with the son.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",104
"105","29843. Why were the eviction proceedings stopped?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",105
"106","—I had nothing to do with that; I did not stop them.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",106
"107","29844. You would have preferred perhaps that they were not stopped?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",107
"108","—No, I would not. I had nothing to do with the action.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",108
"109","29845. Were you in court in connection with this matter ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",109
"110","—Not personally, the case was in court.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",110
"111","29846. Were you obliged to pay damages in connection with it?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",111
"112","—Yes.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",112
"113","29847. What did you pay those damages for ? Why was it you agreed to pay damages rather than that the case should go on ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",113
"114","—The case did go on.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",114
"115","29848. Then it was a decision of the sheriff that was given against you ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",115
"116","—Yes.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",116
"117","29849. You are still manager of the estate notwithstanding the change of ownership ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",117
"118","—Yes.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",118
"119","29850. Can you tell me what the extent of this forest we have been referring to is?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",119
"120","—It is considered to be about 12,000 acres.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",120
"121","29851. Was it all constituted at one time?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",121
"122","—I think it was.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",122
"123","29852. Was it in your time ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",123
"124","—No, it was before my time.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",124
"125","29853. Were ad these 12,000 acres pasture to which certain crofters on the estate were entitled to send their sheep and cattle ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",125
"126","—There were three or four townships which had so much privilege on it.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",126
"127","29851. Over the whole of it?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",127
"128","—No. There is a place called Balgie tenanted by one man, in the low country. His lease expired at the time of the clearances and Scott of Tulloch got it.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",128
"129","29855. Scott of Tulloch got Balgie ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",129
"130","—No, Donald Mackenzie.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",130
"131","29856. And part of Scott of Tulloch's farm?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",131
"132","—Part of Tulloch.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",132
"133","29857. And when the part of the crofter's land constituted the forest ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",133
"134","—Yes.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",134
"135","29858. All these three put together ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",135
"136","—Yes.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",136
"137","29859. Is it correct that there was an apparent reduction made in the rent of the crofters when the pasture was taken from them, but that it was added in another year ?",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",137
"138","—I am not aware of that.",501,"Donald Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",138
