"1","DONALD MACKENZIE, Manager—recalled.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",1
"2","29425. The Chairman.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",2
"3","—As the statement was voluntarily made by the last witness, I wish you to have an opportunity to explain about this alleged custom of purchasing cattle ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",3
"4","—I hold a farm in the low country —about 100 acres arable; —and I also hold about 190 acres of pasture here, a small island which was taken off a large farm, and about 110 acres at my own house; and I never bought a beast yet on the Gairloch estate or anywhere else except with hard cash and with the full consent of the seller ; indeed, I have been pressed to buy cattle, but would not accept of them unless they suited me.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",4
"5","29426. Where is this low country farm?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",5
"6","—On the Conon estate, in the parish of Urquhart.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",6
"7","29427. And you buy cattle to take them there and feed them ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",7
"8","—No, I buy them when I require a cow to kill, or a few beasts for grazing. I buy them sometimes and keep them on my own grass and sell them again; but I never bought an animal for which I did not pay hard cash like any other man. I am not a cattle dealer.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",8
"9","29428. And you do this with the full knowledge and consent of Sir Kenneth ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",9
"10","—Yes; I don't know what the meaning of this cry is.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",10
"11","29429. Mr Cameron.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",11
"12","—In the course of these purchases has it never happened that you have endeavoured to buy beasts from a crofter, and have failed in the matter of price, and that he has sold them to somebody else ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",12
"13","—Yes. I buy cattle in the market. I don't make a habit of buying cattle. I buy a few in the year; I don't remember when I bought a beast from a crofter.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",13
"14","29430. But you have bargained with a crofter as you have done with other people ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",14
"15","—Yes.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",15
"16","29431. And if you didn't agree about the price the crofter has not sold you the beast ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",16
"17","—Yes, that is so.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",17
"18","29432. And you have dealt with the crofter as any other cattle buyer would deal ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",18
"19","—Quite so; and I don't find it a bit easier to buy better from a crofter than from anyone else. They are quite able to take care of themselves.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",19
"20","29433. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",20
"21","—Do you consider it consistent with your office to transact or deal with people who are very much under you in this way, in buying their animals ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",21
"22","—I have never made a practice of it.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",22
"23","29434. Do you consider it consistent with your office as factor or ground-officer to transact, with crofters and people who are dependent on your good will, in the matter of buying beasts from them?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",23
"24","—I would not consider it right to do it to any extent; but I think it would be rather hard if a fellow might not buy a cow or a stirk once or twice in a year. It is so little that I really do, that there could be nothing said about it. I don't believe it would be right to do it to any extent on a large scale.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",24
"25","29435. Have you been reading the reports of the evidence given in Skye",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",25
"26","—Yes.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",26
"27","29436. And you observed that complaints were made that the factors or bailiffs were in the habit of buying and selling cattle ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",27
"28","—Yes.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",28
"29","29437. Do you not deal in meal considerably ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",29
"30","—I will tell you how I did with it. I brought meal home some years ago for the work people, and I gave it to them so cheap that I was bothered by other people, and that is more the people's fault than mine. I was anxious for several years to get out of it. I would be glad to give the trade up.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",30
"31","29438. Do you deal in anything else but meal ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",31
"32","—I supply all the crofters and farmers with seed, and the hotel-keepers with corn.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",32
"33","29439. You have a regular store ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",33
"34","—I have not.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",34
"35","29440. Where is it stored ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",35
"36","—It is not stored at all. I get orders for it, and people come to the steamers and take it away.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",36
"37","29441. But you get a commission ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",37
"38","—I do.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",38
"39","29442. Do you state positively that Sir Kenneth Mackenzie is aware of these transactions of yours ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",39
"40","—I think he is ; everybody is aware, I think.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",40
"41","29443. Are you aware of any dissatisfaction being expressed in any manner by people of the district at your dealing in this manner ?",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",41
"42","—Do you mean by the people 1",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",42
"43","29444. Yes.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",43
"44","—The reverse of that. They complain that I wont have more dealings with them; and I should be glad if you took any man at random, in the crowd, and examine him upon that point.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",44
"45","29445. The Chairman.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",45
"46","—I think it is fair, as you have said, that we should do that.",495,"Donald Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",46
