"1","ALEXANDER BUCHANAN, Labourer, Killean (60)—examined.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",1
"2","36876. The Chairman.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",2
"3","—You wish to make an explanation?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",3
"4","—The last witness did not explain exactly about the grass. When Mr Cheyne commenced to remove the tenants, he made them lay out a piece of arable land for a year under grass, what the tenant should have had under cultivation; and he made the tenant sow this piece every year with rye grass; and after he got the whole arable land under rye grass he sent the tenant about his business, and took all to himself for stock. That was the reason for his making them sow it under grass, that he might send the tenant about his business and take the croft to himself; and he did so until he had the whole estate cleared except a part of Auchnacroish and Killean.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",4
"5","36877. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",5
"6","—Did he make them also pay the full rent ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",6
"7","—Yes, the full rent,",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",7
"8","36878. The Chairman.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",8
"9","—Did the tenants get a crop of hay ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",9
"10","—I cannot say for that.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",10
"11","36879. He made the tenants prepare the ground for the sheep farm?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",11
"12","—Yes, and sow it down with grass.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",12
"13","36880. And then sent them away?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",13
"14","—Yes, one by one, until he had the whole estate to himself.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",14
"15","36881. Did he begin this process before the potato famine ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",15
"16","—I believe he did. I think the potato disease commenced about 1848 or 1849.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",16
"17","36882. 1846, was it not ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",17
"18","—There might have been symptoms of it then.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",18
"19","36883. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",19
"20","—Are you one of the tenants ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",20
"21","—No; I am on the estate of Captain Campbell.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",21
"22","36884. The Chairman.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",22
"23","—Where did Mr Cheyne come from?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",23
"24","—Fifeshire, I think. He was an advocate. He had Woodcockdale, in Linlithgowshire I think, and another estate in Fifeshire.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",24
"25","36885. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",25
"26","—You were never upon his land?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",26
"27","—No, but I recollect it.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",27
"28","36886. Do you recollect what he did creating a great deal of sensation at the time ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",28
"29","—Yes, when I was young the population in Lismore was 1800. The parish schoolmaster we had told me, a year or two before he died, that when he came to Lismore the population was, I think, 1650, and now it is not much more than 637.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",29
"30","36887. That would be in 1821 ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",30
"31","—I think 1816.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",31
"32","36888. Professor Mackinnon.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",32
"33","—He would have come in 1816, but the first census would be in 182?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",33
"34","—Perhaps so.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",34
"35","36889. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",35
"36","—Is Lismore as fertile as it was?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",36
"37","—Equally as fertile, to give it justice, as it ought to get.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",37
"38","36890. Do you know whether any of those who were dispossessed ever represented the propriety of repopulating a part of the estate ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",38
"39","—It would be of no use, because the present tenant—Mr Paterson—has a lease, and during his lease the Duke would not do that.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",39
"40","36891. Has it been under the same family ever since the Duke got it?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",40
"41","—Yes. There was one Mr Stewart, at one time a Dumfries farmer, but it is since Mr Paterson took it that the Duke of Argyll bought the estate. Mrs Cheyne had the estate for a good number of years, and then it was bought by the Duke of Argyll.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",41
"42","36892. When did the Duke buy it?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",42
"43","—Not many years ago. I don't know the exact number, perhaps seven or eight.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",43
"44","36893. Has the Duke ever visited the estate ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",44
"45","—Often; once every year almost, although he has not been here this year yet.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",45
"46","36894. Has he shown any attention or kindness to the crofters who remained ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",46
"47","—Well, he does not encourage great improvements, so far as I know.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",47
"48","36895. Professor Mackinnon.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",48
"49","—Are you able to say how many years were allowed the tenant in Mr Cheyne's time to convert his croft from an arable croft suitable for himself to a grazing croft suitable for Mr Cheyne ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",49
"50","—Maybe two years, until he got the ground in order for himself.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",50
"51","36896. Was the preparation going on at the tenant's expense ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",51
"52","—At the tenant's expense.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",52
"53","36897. For the good of Mr Cheyne ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",53
"54","—Yes, and sometimes he sent the tenant away and took hold of everything. I had an uncle who had a croft, and he might be £ 10 or £15 in arrears. He was getting old and of a religious disposition, and Mr Cheyne was always bothering him for arrears, and he sent horses and cattle to Mr Cheyne, and he never got a farthing back, although they would have brought a good deal more than the amount of his debt.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",54
"55","36898. Was it a general rule that Mr Cheyne himself took the stock of those who went away ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",55
"56","—I could not say; but he took the stock of those who were in arrears.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",56
"57","36899. And those who were not in arrear he allowed to make market where they could ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",57
"58","—Yes, I believe so.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",58
"59","36900. Are any of those who were on that estate still in Lismore?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",59
"60","—Yes, but I cannot say whether any one of them is to speak to-day. Some may have gone to America, but not very many, I think.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",60
"61","36901. Do their relatives at home ever hear how they are prospering?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",61
"62","—They are doing pretty well, I believe.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",62
"63","36902. And what became of those who went to the large towns?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",63
"64","—They are work ng away as best they can—some of them doing well, and some indifferently.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",64
"65","36903. Sheriff Nicolson.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",65
"66","—Are there any crofters on the place where you live ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",66
"67","—Yes, there are a number of crofts in Killean on the Duke's estate. I had a croft in Ballyveolan, with my brother, but I am not in it now.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",67
"68","36904. Did you give it up willingly ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",68
"69","—I cannot say. I was in a manner forced to give it up, because I was an old bachelor, like a great many others; I don't know whether you are one or not. There was a disagreement in the family, and the factor was helping me. The factors are the greatest evil in this country—our landlord we seldom see—although he is a fine man, Captain Campbell But we have a bad law in Lismore with regard to crofts. A poor tenant has here to build his own house and paper it, and do everything, and he may be removed next year, because there is no lease; we are all tenants at will. For instance, I built a new house, byre, and everything, and perhaps I would get a few cabers to put upon it ; the next year, if I had to leave the house, people would be sent to see what it was worth, and I would have to pay the difference and march; and dykes the same way.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",69
"70","36905. You are referring to the Ballyveolan estate?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",70
"71","—Yes, and that of almost every other proprietor in Lismore in my young days. I don't know exactly how they are now.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",71
"72","36906. What is your occupation now ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",72
"73","—Labourer.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",73
"74","36907. Where do you work?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",74
"75","—With Mr M'Intyre, the lime merchant.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",75
"76","36908. Constantly ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",76
"77","—Yes, I am happy to say, constantly.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",77
"78","36909. The Chairman.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",78
"79","—Does he give you good wages ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",79
"80","—Pretty good, as good as what are going in the country, and I am willing to have it as it is. Work is not easy to get in this island.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",80
"81","36910. Do you work by the piece?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",81
"82","—No, so much a week, a day, or year.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",82
"83","36911. What are the current wages at this place ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",83
"84","—About 18s. or £1 a week, less or more.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",84
"85","36912. Would it be possible to give work by the piece, or would the nature of the work not allow it ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",85
"86","—Sometimes they did work by the piece in the quarry where I am, but not now. The people are as well off working by time as on piece work. I believe they are as happy, and it is as good as if we were on piece work.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",86
"87","36913. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",87
"88","—Is 18s. quarrier's wages or that of labourers ?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",88
"89","—That is the wages here, and it is more in some places.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",89
"90","36914. Is 18s. the ordinary wages for general work?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",90
"91","—Farm labourers don't work by the day or week. I don't know how much the farmers give the labourers; but when I had a farm I used to give 2s. 6d. or 3s. a day for their services during harvest; I never employed labourers at any other time of the year.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",91
"92","36915. Sheriff Nicolson.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",92
"93","—Have you a house of your own?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",93
"94","—I am in lodgings.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",94
"95","36916. That is because you don't marry?",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",95
"96","—Yes, it is my own fault.",609,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Lismore",96
