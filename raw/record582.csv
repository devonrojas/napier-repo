"3","—Have you any statement to make?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",3
"4","—I  have been a fisherman from my youth, and that source of living for the  last sixteen years has been getting less and less; and now, in my old  age, I would be glad, if possible, to get a piece of land.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",4

"12","—Clark and M'Lean, in Ulva,",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",12
"13","35188. And you fish salmon for them?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",13
"14","—For myself.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",14
"15","35189. You have a piece of the shore for yourself?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",15
"16","—Yes.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",16
"17","35190. How much of the shore have you?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",17
"18","—I have the whole place round Ulva and Gometra.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",18
"19","35191. Whom do you give the fish to ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",19
"20","—Mr M'Quarrie ; we are in shares.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",20
"21","35192. Where do you fish the lobsters?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",21
"22","—Erraid Island, since thirty years.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",22
"23","35193. You cannot fish there in winter ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",23
"24","—Yes; I was there thirty years fishing winter and summer all round.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",24
"25","35194. And do you say the fishing is going back ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",25
"26","—Yes, every kind of fish is getting scarce.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",26
"27","35195. You want to get land now?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",27
"28","—Yes.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",28
"29","35196. Are you tired of the sea?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",29
"30","—Yes.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",30
"31","35197. There is no cod and ling fishing about here, is there ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",31
"32","—Yes, there is.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",32
"33","35198. Can it be prosecuted with success?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",33
"34","—People are so poor, and they cannot prosecute the fishing in summer, because there is no way of curing the fish. ",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",34
"35","35199. Where do they fish cod and ling?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",35
"36","—Between Iona and Dhu Heartach. ",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",36
"37","35200. And do you know the fishing ground well enough ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",37
"38","—Oh, yes.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",38
"39","35201. Do you think there is plenty of fish?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",39
"40","—Plenty.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",40
"41","35202. And what is required in order to enable the fishing to be prosecuted successfully?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",41
"42","—Just good boats and help for the poor fishermen.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",42
"43","35203. To get boats and lines?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",43
"44","—Yes.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",44
"45","35204. Do you think if they had that they would be able to make a living out of the fishing?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",45
"46","—Yes, I am sure of it, if the fish are as plentiful now as they were in my time.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",46
"47","35205. Do the herring come this way at all?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",47
"48","—There are plenty of herring passing, if there was a good boat to get them.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",48
"49","35206.  Do you think the herring come so near the shores here, that if people  had large boats and nets they should get the herring ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",49
"50","—Yes, I am  sure of it ; and every year since I have commenced I have seen plenty of  them between Dhu Heartach and Iona, and out here just the same.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",50
"51","35207. You don't know if any of the people here have tried the herring fishing outside ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",51
"52","—It was never tried outside.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",52
"53","35208. But you are quite convinced from your knowledge of their ways and habits the fish are there every summer ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",53
"54","—I am quite sure of it.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",54
"55","35209. Is there a good harbour at Erraid Island ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",55
"56","—Plenty of good islands all round the coast, and good harbours too.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",56
"57","35210. So that there would be no quays required or anything of that sort ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",57
"58","—No; the fishermen could get ashore in any place.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",58
"59","35211. And are there many young, strong men about the place who would be able to take up that work ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",59
"60","—Yes.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",60
"61","35212. And willing?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",61
"62","—And willing, if they had the means to do it.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",62
"63","35213. And they are good boatmen?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",63
"64","—Oh, yes, very good.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",64
"65","35214. Do you know if they ever applied to any men with money for boats and lines, agreeing to pay them back by degrees ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",65
"66","—I am not aware that they did.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",66
"67","35215. I suppose there are no large boats big enough for the ocean fishing ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",67
"68","—No.  I have one, but the way I put out so much money on the salmon fishing,  and did not do anything with it, I was not able to get herring nets to  try it, but I am very willing.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",68
"69","35216. Have you a boat yourself ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",69
"70","—Yes.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",70
"71","35217. Is that the boat we saw out in the bay as we came in ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",71
"72","—Yes.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",72
"73","35218. What is the length of keel ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",73
"74","—Thirty feet.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",74
"75","35219. It is one of the ordinary east coast boats?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",75
"76","—Yes. She was built at Loch Carron.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",76
"77","35220. Is she big enough ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",77
"78","—Big enough ; she was at the herring fishing before I got her.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",78
"79","35221. They are having much larger boats on the east coast now ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",79
"80","—Yes; but she is big enough for this coast.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",80
"81","35222. Don't you think that it would pay to salt the cod and ling, although there is no market for the fresh fish?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",81
"82","—Yes, I am quite sure of it ; for twenty-four summers I was curing cod and ling, and it paid me well.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",82
"83","35223.  Of course, you would make a much better wage if you had a market for  the fresh fish, but still you could make a wage with the salt fish ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",83
"84","—Yes. I have sent 4½  tons of dried fish away, and I used to get £18 and £18, 10s. a ton.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",84
"85","35224. Why didn't you persuade some of the young men to go to that work after you stopped it yourself?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",85
"86","—The majority of them are getting so poor that they cannot get stores and material and boats to put up all that is required.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",86
"87","35225. Are the lobsters getting scarcer about the shore ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",87
"88","—Yes.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",88
"89","35226. How do you account for that ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",89
"90","—There are too many fishing them.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",90
"91","35227. Do you keep close time?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",91
"92","—No.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",92
"93","35228. You never did here ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",93
"94","—No; that is what is spoiling them, fishing through the summer.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",94
"95","35229. Why don't you arrange amongst yourselves to keep close time?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",95
"96","—It was not put in force.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",96
"97","35230. Although one might keep close time others would not?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",97
"98","—Yes.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",98
"99","35231. And could that fishing be now prosecuted with profit—could one make wages upon the lobster fishing round the south end ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",99
"100","—It has kept them thus far.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",100
"101","35232. You would wish to get some land now ; would you be able to take up a good-sized croft ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",101
"102","—I could manage to keep four or five cows ; I would not want a bigger size than that.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",102
"103","35233. Did you make any application to the factor when there was a vacant croft ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",103
"104","—I many a time asked a croft, and did not get it yet.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",104
"105","35234. I suppose there is keen competition for a croft when there is a vacancy ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",105
"106","—Yes.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",106
"107","35235. There are more crofters than crofts ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",107
"108","—Yes.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",108
"109","35236. You heard those who have land complain that the rent is very high?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",109
"110","—Yes, the rent is too high.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",110
"111","35237. Even supposing you think the rent too high you would wish to get one of those crofts ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",111
"112","—Not at the same rent.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",112
"113","35238. You think as rents go upon the crofts on this estate, fishing is the more profitable of the two ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",113
"114","—I  would prefer land ; I am getting too old for fishing. I was twenty-four  years paying rent for one end of a house. It was built so close to the  shore that the tide came in, and I had to thatch it and keep it in  repair, and pay £4 rent for the bare house. Then I got the whole house  for £5. At last the rent was raised to £8, the bare house.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",114
"115","35239. To whom did you pay the rent ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",115
"116","—To Mr Campbell, the factor.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",116
"117","35240. You don't stay in that house now?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",117
"118","—No, I had to leave it.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",118
"119","35241. You had not a bit of land about it ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",119
"120","—No, I had not; just a wee bit garden that would raise a barrel of potatoes.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",120
"121","35242. Who has it now ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",121
"122","—Mr M'Niven.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",122
"123","35243. What does he pay for it?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",123
"124","—He has a big farm, and the house goes with the farm.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",124
"125","35244. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",125
"126","—Did you not mention something about Ulva ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",126
"127","—I had the fishing there for the last eight years.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",127
"128","35245. Do you know the island of Ulva?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",128
"129","—I do.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",129
"130","35246. Do you recollect it when it belonged to the M'Quaries ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",130
"131","—I don't remember that.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",131
"132","35247. Are there many people on it now ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",132
"133","—Only four shepherds and two or three cottars.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",133
"134","35248. Was it not once a very populous island ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",134
"135","—I have heard it said there were eighty families on it.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",135
"136","35249. Were those families all removed against their own consent about the same period ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",136
"137","—I heard that, but cannot speak to it.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",137
"138","35250. Is that very long ago ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",138
"139","—About thirty years ago.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",139
"140","35251. Was it the father of the present proprietor who did it?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",140
"141","—It was the present proprietor.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",141
"142","35252. Is Ulva a fertile island ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",142
"143","—It was once a good island, but it is not very fertile now; it is grown with weeds, rushes, and ferns.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",143
"144","35253. From whom did Mr Clark purchase it?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",144
"145","—I don't know, but I think it was the M'Quarries.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",145
"146","35254. The Chairman.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",146
"147","—You  said the lobster fishing had fallen off very much; if you ceased to  fish lobsters for a year or two, would the lobsters increase again and  be as numerous as ever ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",147
"148","—Yes.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",148
"149","35255. Would it be a good thing if the Government enforced the law for a close season for lobsters ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",149
"150","—It  would be well for the fishermen if the Government would put some  restriction upon the fishing. They are carting them in the summer, and  half of them die before they reach the market. If they were not fished  at that time these fish would be useful.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",150
"151","35256. What use do you put your big boat to at present ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",151
"152","—When I am fishing lobsters that boat is my home.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",152
"153","35257. But you say you are now becoming too old ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",153
"154","—Yes, but I am still fishing.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",154
"155","35258.  Suppose, instead of repairing to the land, you became a fishcurer, and  let your boat to four or five of the young men of the place, could you  not make some money in that way ?",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",155
"156","—I believe I could. I know the  fishing grounds well, and if I had a crew and sufficient nets and boats,  I could make a good living.",582,"Neil Matheson","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",156
