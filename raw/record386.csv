"111","22314. What was the object of introducing sheep, and turning out the men?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",111
"112","—I don't know; for the profit of the proprietor I understand.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",112
"113","22315. Was that the only reason?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",113
"114","—There were none of the people in debt.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",114

"116","—Yes, I did not hear of one being due a shilling.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",116
"117","22317. Were they fishermen as well as crofters?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",117
"118","—Yes, but I don't know. I was a seaman for forty-two years, and I had a small pension from Whitehall in London, as a merchant sailor.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",118
"119","22318. You say that among the grievances the people sent you here to represent one is that the rents are too high?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",119
"120","—High rents.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",120

"122","—To be sure.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",122
"123","22320. And do not want to be turned out?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",123
"124","—No, we want a fair valuation for what we have; because if we had more land we would not have sufficient to stock it. It is not caused so much by the landlords as by the factors and ground officers, and assessors, and then the master takes it up. Mr Hay, I believe, is the best rent master; when the day comes you must pay it. He has his cottages in good order j but for my part there has no stone been lifted for ninety-three years, when my father was in it.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",124
"125","22321. Who is your proprietor at this moment?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",125
"126","—Mr Hay.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",126
"127","22322. And he keeps your buildings in good order?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",127
"128","—Yes, but for my part there has not one stone been removed for ninety years. It is a hovel that gives me a little shelter. My grandfather was in it before. ",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",128
"129","22323. Have any of you got leases?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",129
"130","—No, no leases at all; but if we improve there is £1 put on one year and 10s. another; that is the",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",130
"131","encouragement we get.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",131
"132","22324. And you don't care for that kind of encouragement?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",132
"133","—No, and only forty days' notice to quit; and where can we go?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",133
"134","22325. Are you really paying this rent because you don't know very well where to go to?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",134
"135","—No, it is laid on, and I cannot go any further.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",135
"136","22326. Are you continuing to pay the high rent because you cannot better yourself?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",136
"137","—To be sure.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",137
"138","22327. What length of lease would you like to have?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",138
"139","—I don't care what length of lease I get, because my lease is going out.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",139
"140","22328. Your lease of life?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",140
"141","—Yes.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",141
"142","22329. But we were told by a man in Skye, who was seventy-eight years of age, that if he got a lease he would have a try yet?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",142
"143","—So I might, but the rent is too high.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",143
"144","22330. But if you got encouragement, and the people in your neighbourhood the same, you would improve a great deal more than you are doing?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",144
"145","—I am improving as hard as I can, and the people are all doing the same; but those who do most get 10s., or £1 laid on.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",145
"146","22331. Are you obliged to buy anything for the support of your family?",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",146
"147","—Yes, plenty times I have to buy.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",147
"148","22332. The croft does not support you? ",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",148
"149","—No.",386,"Magnus Tait","Shetland, Lerwick",149
