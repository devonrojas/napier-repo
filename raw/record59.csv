"1","ALEXANDER MORRISON, Crofter and Fisherman, Forsavriev (40)— examined. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",1
"2","3535. The Chairman.",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",2
"3","—Are you a freely elected delegate ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",3
"4","—Yes. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",4
"5","3536. When?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",5
"6","—To-day. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",6
"7","3537. Why did they not elect their delegate sooner ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",7
"8","—We were long of hearing. We came over here, and we could not get any person to write for us. We could not write ourselves. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",8
"9","3538. Did any one try to prevent you corresponding with the Commission ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",9
"10","—No. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",10
"11","3539. What statement are you authorised to make to the Commission?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",11
"12","— That we are in a bad place. Our arable land is peat to the depth of about 3 or 4 feet, and it is not yielding crop. We took it in ourselves. We were getting Is. a rood from the laird for taking it in. We cannot get sea-weed to manure our land, unless with fine weather and a south wind. Each of us could sow three or four bags of seed oats. There are some of us who bought two bolls of seed oats to sow, and some of us who, even with the two bolls of seed oats which they bought, along with the seed which the land yielded, had not sufficient to sow their land. All the potatoes which we can cultivate will not support us more than two or three months, at any rate, this year. Our stock is, some two cows, and others three cows each, and maybe a stirk or a two-year-old. I cannot tell how many sheep we have. The sheep don't belong to ourselves they belong to the landlord. We keep a horse each, and the land is so soft and boggy, that I can only get three hours' work out of the horse, and others cannot work with the horses at all. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",12
"13","3540. How much is the rent ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",13
"14","—£9 and a few shillings each. 1 have to pay wintering for the cows. It would be enough for me to winter one of the cows and a horse with my crop. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",14
"15","3541. Has the rent been raised ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",15
"16","—No. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",16
"17","3542. How long has it been the same rent?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",17
"18","—Since I went to Forsavriev, nineteen years ago, it has not been raised. It was not for the habitation of man that that place was created at all. During the past twenty days or month we took out of the bogs on our land up to twenty ewes and some hoggs, which were drowned in the bogs.(see Appendix A. VII)",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",18
"19","3543. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",19
"20","—Were they your own?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",20
"21","—It was of our own sheep stock, but the sheep stock we did not consider to belong to ourselves at all. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",21
"22","3544. The Chairman.",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",22
"23","—Why ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",23
"24","—The day we leave we cannot take any of them with us. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",24
"25","3545. Is that on account of arrears of rent ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",25
"26","—The sheep belong to the landlord. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",26
"27","3546. Why do you let the common pasture to the landlord?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",27
"28","—When the people got the township, the landlord sold them the sheep stock, which they were to pay for, and since then they have not been able to pay for the stock. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",28
"29","3547. Have they paid any of it?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",29
"30","—I do not know, but they may havepaida little at first.",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",30
"31","3548. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",31
"32","—Do they pay interest?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",32
"33","—Yes, they payinterest.",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",33
"34","3549. Sheriff Nicolson.",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",34
"35","—What was the amount of the stock?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",35
"36","—160 ewes. I was not among the first tenants at all. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",36
"37","3550. What price were they sold at?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",37
"38","—£1 and 22s. each. Some of the crofters tell me so. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",38

"40","—Twenty-two years ago. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",40
"41","3552. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",41
"42","—I understand this was a new settlement ? ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",42
"43","—There were no tenants in it until we settled in it twenty-two years ago. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",43
"44","3553. When they came twenty-two years ago, was there any arable land at all ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",44
"45","—There was a little when we went there first, but we were shifted down to the lower place since. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",45
"46","3554. But the arable land you have now is all newly improved land ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",46
"47","— Yes. They got Is. a rood for trenching and improving this. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",47
"48","3555. Did they pay interest on that money ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",48
"49","—No. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",49
"50","3556. But was the rent fixed before the land was taken in ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",50
"51","—Yes. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",51
"52","3557. Then this £9 odd, does that include interest upon the stock ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",52
"53","—No. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",53
"54","3558. This is the rent simply of the share of the hill land you got before it was improved ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",54
"55","—Yes. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",55
"56","3559. Did you go there of your own free will ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",56
"57","—Yes. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",57
"58","3560. Have you not spent money since in improving the land ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",58
"59","—Yes. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",59
"60","3561. How much Ì",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",60
"61","—I cannot say. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",61
"62","3562. How many acres have you improved at Is. a rood?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",62
"63","—Between fourteen and fifteen. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",63
"64","3563. The Chairman.",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",64
"65","—So the Is. a rood amounted to a good day's wages ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",65
"66","—Yes, I would make three roods a day. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",66
"67","3564. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",67
"68","—It seems you got a very bad bargain of the farm ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",68
"69","—Yes, there are rocks, and our sheep are going over these rocks to the sea-shore, and are carried away by the sea, the sea being directly under these rocks. Others of our sheep stick in the cliffs, and we have to lower a man down with ropes to get them extricated. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",69
"70","3665. Does the proprietor refuse to relieve you of your bargain ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",70
"71","—We were within the last year asking another place of him, and he was promising it. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",71
"72","3566. What do you think the Commission should do for you?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",72
"73","—The land which is wasted both in Minginish and Bracadale, where my forefathers were born, should be restored to the people. There is plenty of land for all the inhabitants of Skye, if they could get it. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",73
"74","3567. Did you come from Bracadale nineteen years ago?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",74
"75","—No, but my father came from Bracadale to Minginish. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",75
"76","3568. Where did the others come from ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",76
"77","—From Ascrib island, some of them. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",77
"78","3569. How many tenants were at Ascrib island?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",78
"79","—Five. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",79
"80","3570. Do your horses and cows go upon the common pasture occasionally where the proprietor's sheep are?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",80
"81","—Yes. ",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",81
"82","3571. The Chairman.",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",82
"83","—Then the common pasture is useful to you, although the sheep belong to the landlord ?",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",83
"84","—Yes, it is ourselves who get the produce of the sheep, but the day we leave we have no sheep; and if we would be another year in the place, we would not have a cow or sheep or other creature that we could take with us over the dyke, if next year will be as the present year. The parties who are the means of this Royal Commission are suffering in prison, and we are quiet here, and if we don't get justice we will go to prison ourselves, or else we will sell our lives as dear as possible.",59,"Alexander Morrison","Skye, Waternish",84
