"20","—They are particularly complaining of the extent of their land. It is about twenty-eight yards in breadth at the foot of the croft in some of them : in others it is broader than that.

"41","—What do you complain of?",479,"Alexander Mackenzie, Allan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",41
"42","—My complaint is that I was deprived of my land fifteen years ago. We were left for twelve years in a bothy into which the sea came and destroyed everything. About three years ago the minister gave us another house. I held a croft formerly under his predecessor, Dr Ross, and I kept some sheep, and the present minister complained that I had those sheep. He had forbidden our having sheep. I suppose it was on account of that that he took my land from me. I was not in arrears.",479,"Alexander Mackenzie, Allan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",42
