"1","JOHN OMAND, Crofter and Fisherman, Mid Yell (57)—examined.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",1
"2","(See Appendix A, LI.)",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",2
"3","18807. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",3
"4","—Have you been chosen by a number of the people to come here to-day ?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",4
"5","—I was asked if I would come, and I asked another man if he would come and he would not, and therefore I came.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",5
"6","18808. How many met to choose you?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",6
"7","—-About sixteen, I think.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",7
"8","18809. What did they wish you to state?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",8
"9","—In the first place, I should like a Government valuation put upon the property we are now occupying; the rental is too high.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",9
"10","18810. That is the wish of the people who sent you here?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",10
"11","—Yes; and secondly, an improvement in the homesteads and houses we live in; that they may be made more comfortable than they are at the present time.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",11
"12","18811. Anything further?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",12
"13","—And then, at least upon the property that we occupy, that we won't be turned off at any time the proprietor wishes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",13
"14","18812. What length of lease do you desire?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",14
"15","—As long as we could get—ten or twenty or thirty years.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",15
"16","18813. What is the name of the property on which you live?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",16
"17","—Kaywick.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",17
"18","18814. Who is the proprietor?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",18
"19","—Lady Budge.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",19
"20","18815. What rent do you pay ?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",20
"21","—1 pay £10.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",21
"22","18816. For how much ground?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",22
"23","—Three and a half acres of cultivated ground—that is, taxes and all.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",23
"24","18817. And what scathold rights have you with that?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",24
"25","—I could not say the extent of scathold, but it is very small indeed.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",25
"26","18818. What stock do you keep?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",26
"27","—About six head of cattle is all we can keep, young and old together.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",27
"28","18819. No horses?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",28
"29","—Yes, we have four ponies.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",29
"30","18820. And sheep?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",30
"31","—I think we have about eighteen head of sheep on the scathold.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",31
"32","18821. What quantity of crop do you get from the croft—potatoes and oats?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",32
"33","—The quantity is small indeed, and would not do to support a family if it were not for the grain we get from the south country.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",33
"34","18822. How long would it support you?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",34
"35","—Three months would be the outside of it, and sometime not that. Some years we have to take the greater part of the crop to give to the cattle to save them.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",35
"36","18823. Do you do anything to your house yourself, or is it found by the proprietor?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",36
"37","—It used to be found by the proprietor, but now he won't do anything unless we do it ourselves. When we came to the house—it is merely a house of four rooms—we had to do the inside of it for ourselves. The lady tried to tighten the roof, but it is not tight yet; and we are thinking if we could get a lease we would put up a roof upon it ourselves.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",37
"38","18824. What kind of roof has it?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",38
"39","—A slate roof; but it has been standing, I believe, upwards of fifty or sixty years.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",39
"40","18825. You have a slated house of four rooms, but damaged?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",40
"41","—Yes, it is damaged.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",41
"42","18826. You have a byre?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",42
"43","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",43
"44","18827. And stable?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",44
"45","—No, no stable; the ponies lie out all winter. A few may have stables, but we never had any.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",45
"46","18828. Is the byre slated?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",46
"47","—No, thatched.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",47
"48","18829. Have you to keep the thatch up yourselves?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",48
"49","—Of course we do. We build byres and barns to ourselves.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",49
"50","18830. But not the dwelling house?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",50
"51","—No; it was always considered that the proprietors should do that.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",51
"52","18831. How long have you been there?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",52
"53","—Only five years in this place.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",53
"54","18832. And it was a bad house when you came to it?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",54
"55","—It was going to decay in the inside.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",55
"56","18833. Where did you come from?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",56
"57","—The island of Unst",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",57
"58","18834. What induced you to come here and take a dear place without a lease?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",58
"59","—Rise of rents where I came from. I was away for a long time out of the country. The most of my life has been spent in the south, I was away for a long time, and when I came home the town I was then living in was paying £16 yearly. There were three small crofts, and I went to the proprietor of Fetlar, and offered to take the whole town at the same rent, and he then raised the rent £8 more on the town, and then I would not take it. The result of the thing was I had to go to Major Cameron and take a croft from him in North Yell, and removing all my effects from the place I was residing in on to Major Cameron's property cost me over £50. I went there, and took a farm from him for £7, 10s. of rent. The first two years I settled the rent with him myself, but the next three years I was on the property he put his lands into the hands of the factor Mr Walker, and the rent he took from me was £8 —that was 10s. of a rise; the second rent he took was £9, 16s., and the third rent was £14; and then I had to fly from there again, and go from there to the island of Unst, and take a farm from the major again. There was no other proprietor I could get one from, and I went to Unst and took a farm at £7, 10s. I was there nine years, and after the improvements I made on the property,—over £50 worth,—the rent was raised to £9, 10s., and I left and came here. That is the way I have been served in Shetland.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",59
"60","18835. You have accounted for fifteen years or so ?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",60
"61","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",61
"62","18836. Sheriff Nicolson.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",62
"63","—Was this Mr Walker John Walker?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",63
"64","—Yes; there are not many under the British flag who do not know him.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",64
"65","18837. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",65
"66","—At present you are not complaining of the rent, or anything since you have taken this place?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",66
"67","—No. Of course I think the rent rather high for the ground I occupy.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",67
"68","18838. The rent may be raised upon you any day?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",68
"69","—It might be. They can do anything they think proper. As for Lady Budge, I do not think there are many like her in Shetland; she has used her tenants well.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",69
"70","18839. What notice did you get of this rise of rent from Mr Walker?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",70
"71","—I never got notice at all until I came to pay the rent.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",71
"72","18840. And then he asked you for more for that same year?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",72
"73","—For that same year.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",73
"74","18841. And had you the extra money in your pocket?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",74
"75","—No, I had to go and get the loan of the money until I came home. I had to go two miles from the place where I settled with him, and had to borrow money from another until I could pay it back.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",75
"76","18842. About this house you are inhabiting —a slated house of four rooms—what is the cost of building a house of that kind?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",76
"77","—I could not say what it might be worth.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",77
"78","18843. Can you build a house of that sort for £100?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",78
"79","—I do not doubt but 1 could.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",79
"80","18844. It would take all that?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",80
"81","—It would take nothing short of that, I should think. But that was a house built over fifty years ago. It was built first for the proprietor, who used it for keeping his boat gear, and shal and fish, and so on.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",81
"82","18845. One of your demands is for improved houses; if the proprietor were putting up houses of that sort upon crofts worth £3 or £4 or £5, what rent would you expect him to draw for the house?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",82
"83","—The small crofts the Shetland people are occupying could not afford to build houses like it; but, at the same time, such houses as the people in Shetland would like, would be a house of about 30 by 12, with a 7 feet wall, and a wooden roof, with felt. It would answer as well as slate, and be lighter.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",83
"84","18846. What would that cost?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",84
"85","—I could not exactly say. Some here know; but I do not think it would exceed about £50 to build it. If",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",85
"86","the proprietor built the walls and put on the roof, the tenant would do the inside of it for himself—that is, with the expectation of having a lease on the property and knowing that he would not be turned away. I have done up four houses myself in my time, and I have had enough of it.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",86
"87","18847. Professor Mackinnon.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",87
"88","—Are all the people on Lady Budge's property fishing as well as crofting?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",88
"89","—Yes, all fishing.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",89
"90","18848. Who is the factor?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",90
"91","—There is no factor over the property; every tenant pays the rent to herself.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",91
"92","18849. Does she stay in the country?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",92
"93","—Over there in the big house at the other side. She just takes the rents as they can give it.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",93
"94","18850. You say you fish yourself, are you engaged in herring fishing just now?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",94
"95","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",95
"96","18851. With one of the large boats ?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",96
"97","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",97
"98","18852. Whom do you fish for?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",98
"99","—-Mr Walker there.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",99
"100","18853. What is the arrangment between the curer and the crew with reference to their boats?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",100
"101","—I am fishing with Mr Walker's boat, but we deliver the fish to Mr Mackay at the station. We have Mr Walker's boat, but he is not curing the fish; Mr Mackay cures the fish.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",101
"102","18854. And Mr Walker hires the boat to you ?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",102
"103","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",103
"104","18855. And the whole crew share alike in the gain?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",104
"105","—The half share of the fish goes to the crew, and the owner of the boat and nets gets the other half.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",105
"106","18856. And he keeps the boat and nets in repair?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",106
"107","—Yes, and we have the half share of the fish, and he the other half.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",107
"108","18857. And then you sell the fish to the curer?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",108
"109","—Yes, to Mr Mackay.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",109
"110","18858. You choose your own curer?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",110
"111","—Of course that is the man we fish to; that is the man Mr Walker tells us fish to.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",111
"112","18859. Then does Mr Walker choose your curer?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",112
"113","—Yes, of course; the boat and nets are his, and we fish as half-catch men, and he sells the herring to Mr Mackay.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",113
"114","18860. His herring and yours?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",114
"115","—Yes, both of course.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",115
"116","18861. Whom do you take your stores from?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",116
"117","—-We are at liberty to take them from any one we like.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",117
"118","18862. Whom do you take them from?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",118
"119","—From Mr Walker or any other we wish to go to. If we did not wish to go to his store, we would get",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",119
"120","money from him to go to another and buy. That is one good job, we are not confined to any one more than another.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",120
"121","18863. Do you know what is the rule when a boat is bought by a crew, upon what terms is it paid back?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",121
"122","—I am not in the way of going into the buying, and cannot say.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",122
"123","18S64. Do you fish for cod and ling as well as herring?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",123
"124","—I used to. But not this year.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",124
"125","18865. But the owner of the boat provides gear for the deep sea fishing as well?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",125
"126","—Just the same. I have been fishing for five years to a man in North Yell, and he provides the boat and lines.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",126
"127","18866. Are you able to land more fish with these big boats?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",127
"128","—It depends on where we are fishing; of course, we can fish the ling fishing in them as well as in the small boats, and with more safety, I should think; only if I had been going to the ling fishing again, I would prefer the old sixern. It is more handy in the way I have been used to; at the same time a big boat gives more safety.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",128
"129","18867. But hi the herring fishing, you can carry a great many more nets with the big boats?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",129
"130","—Yes, you have a better chance of herring fishing in a big boat than in a smaller one.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",130
"131","18868. You fish more herring with a big boat, and you are safer?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",131
"132","—Yes. ",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",132
"133","18869. It is the same crew—a crew of six in the big boat, as well as in",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",133
"134","the small boat?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",134
"135","—Yes. ",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",135
"136","18870. Who cured the cod and ling last year?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",136
"137","—James Hozean. ",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",137
"138","18871. Was that since you came here?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",138
"139","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",139
"140","18872. Had he a station here?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",140
"141","—No, but in North Yell.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",141
"142","18873. How far is that from here?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",142
"143","—Eight or nine miles.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",143
"144","18874. You would have to stay there at the fishing?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",144
"145","—We went on the Monday, and came home every Saturday. It was from that station there were so many boats cast away three years ago.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",145
"146","18875. Were you there at that time?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",146
"147","—Yes, I was at sea that very day.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",147
"148","18876. Where do you get the herring this season?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",148
"149","—Out at the north end of this island, the north firth.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",149
"150","18877. Right out between Unst and the mainland?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",150
"151","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",151
"152","18878. A good bit away from here?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",152
"153","—Yes, a good bit; and we have bad tides to contend with going through Blue Mull Sound. There have",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",153
"154","been plenty of fish caught there this year.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",154
"155","18879. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",155
"156","—You stated you had only three and a half acres of arable land?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",156
"157","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",157
"158","18880. Do you want more?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",158
"159","—We would make improvements for ourselves if we got a lease.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",159
"160","18881. But you want more?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",160
"161","—Yes, we would improve it for ourselves; we have plenty of surface inside.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",161
"162","18882. Is there plenty of land in your neighbourhood which could be taken in if you got it?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",162
"163","—Yes, there is plenty in the enclosure.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",163
"164","18883. How many tenants has Lady Budge altogether?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",164
"165","—About twentyone.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",165
"166","18884. Are they all in the same position as yourself, wanting to get more land?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",166
"167","—I am not aware as to that. There is so much scathold enclosed with arable ground inside the fence, that any man who wishes to add to his property by cultivating, can do so; he is at liberty to do so.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",167
"168","18885. But you won't do it untd you get a lease?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",168
"169","—No, I would like some security so that I would get the good of my labour.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",169
"170","18886. You are tired of being knocked about from place to place. Have you applied to her Ladyship for a lease?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",170
"171","—Well, yes, I asked her once about it, and I did not think she was very willing to give one; but at",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",171
"172","the same time she said her word was as good as her bond, and I said while she was alive I believed neither I nor any other tenant would be turned off as long as we were of good character, but that would only be. for her life, and we did not know how long that might be.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",172
"173","18887. Is the property her own, or did it belong to her husband?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",173
"174","—Her husband bought it, and I think she is the liferenter now.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",174
"175","18888. Is she a native of Shetland?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",175
"176","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",176
"177","18889. You stated it was necessary for you to buy so much meal in the year, the croft don't support. How much are you obliged to buy on an average?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",177
"178","—Some years it will cost us £10 or £12.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",178
"179","18890. Are you obliged to buy anything for your stock for the winter?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",179
"180","—Sometimes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",180
"181","18891. Has Lady Budge anything in her own hands; has she a home farm?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",181
"182","—Just a little croft along with the house.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",182
"183","18892. What is the biggest rent paid by any of her tenants?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",183
"184","—I pay the largest.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",184
"185","18893. Was it raised when you went in?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",185
"186","—No, it was before I went in it was raised. The original rent was far from that; I think it was £5.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",186
"187","18894. And the house was then new?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",187
"188","—No, I don't mind of the house being built, and know nothing about the building of the house. The",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",188
"189","house must have been built sixty years ago at least.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",189
"190","18895. We have been told that some of the tenants object to fencing, do you know that this the case?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",190
"191","—I am not aware of it. I would approve of fencing every one's piece of ground.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",191
"192","18896. Do you know that some fencing will keep out Cheviot sheep, but will not keep out the Shetland sheep?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",192
"193","—I am aware of that. The Shetland sheep are so small that they would get in between the run of the wire.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",193
"194","18897. Unless it is a very close fence, it is of no value to the small tenant who has native sheep?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",194
"195","—Not at all.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",195
"196","18898. You stated a number of different places jrou removed to when your rent was raised, where a number of people were treated in the same way as well as yourself?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",196
"197","—Yes, on the same property —on Major Cameron's property.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",197
"198","18899. What is the name of the property?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",198
"199","—Garth.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",199
"200","18900. Where does it lie?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",200
"201","—It is in North Yell and Unst and on the mainland of Deeling. That piece of his property was thrown waste for a sheep farm at the time Mr John Walker had it.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",201
"202","18901. Is it still under sheep farms?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",202
"203","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",203
"204","18902. Were many people turned out?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",204
"205","—Yes, I should say there were about thirty or forty families turned out —something simdar to what Fetlar is now. There were about thirty houses thrown to waste on Fetlar at the time Sir Arthur Nicolson made the sheep farm, which he thought would pay him better.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",205
"206","18903. How long is it since this occurred on Major Cameron's property?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",206
"207","—Seventeen or eighteen years ago.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",207
"208","18904. What became of the people?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",208
"209","—They had to look after themselves, and they all got settled down again. Some came here to Lady",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",209
"210","Budge's property, and some went to the estate of West Sandwick, and some went over to places in North Yell, and some to the island of Unst.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",210
"211","18905. Were there any other cases in this neighbourhood of sheep farms being made except these two?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",211
"212","—Salter and Windhouse have been wasted, to my mind.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",212
"213","18906. And there were people there at one time?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",213
"214","—There were.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",214
"215","18907. Wore these good fertile places?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",215
"216","—So far as I am aware of, they were as good as any other of the places now occupied.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",216
"217","18908. Is the population in your neighbourhood increasing or decreasing?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",217
"218","—It has decreased from what it formerly was.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",218
"219","18909. Within your own recollection?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",219
"220","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",220
"221","18910. But is that from people being put away or going away?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",221
"222","—By people being turned from it, and it laid down for sheep farm purposes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",222
"223","18911. Are the people as fond of their homes here as they are in the mainland and islands of Scotland?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",223
"224","—I believe they are, so far as I know.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",224
"225","18912. A good number of them go to sea, and go to all parts of the world?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",225
"226","—Yes, they are through every part of the world mostly now. I have been in a good many places myself, and have found Shetland people there.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",226
"227","18913. But they would like to comeback?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",227
"228","—Some do, but some go away and settle down and make homesteads in the colonies. I would never have come to Shetland again, if it had not been to seeing to my parents.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",228
"229","18914. Was that because you were knocked about?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",229
"230","—No, but I thought I could make more use of my money, and more use of my time abroad.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",230
"231","18915. What is the best country you have been in?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",231
"232","—I could not say one place more than another of the colonies. At sea every place was alike to me, but Victoria was the place I would have approved of.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",232
"233","18916. Are many people from Shetland there?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",233
"234","—A great many. ",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",234
"235","18917. Are they doing well, those who went?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",235
"236","—Mostly, those I know of. ",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",236
"237","18918. The Chairman.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",237
"238","—You say there are some advantages in the larger classes of fishing boats now used?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",238
"239","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",239
"240","18919. Do you think the present class of boat used is perfect, or do you think it should be made larger, or altered, or in any respect made better?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",240
"241","—It might be made better by putting steam into them; but the boat, in its present state, I think, is quite comfortable and safe.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",241
"242","18920. But you would be in favour of introducing steam?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",242
"243","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",243
"244","18921. If a boat of that class were got, would it not be more difficult for fishermen to buy shares and become proprietors of the boat?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",244
"245","—Well, the outlay on the boat would be greater, but then, at the same time, you would have more advantage of the fishing. If you were out in calm weather with the present boats, and falling into a calm you could not save your fish; whereas, if you had steam, you would save the fish, which might be a matter of £40 or £60.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",245
"246","18922. Do you think there is much advantage attached by fishermen to becoming proprietors of their own boat, or do they think it better for them to remain in the position of hirers?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",246
"247","—I think it would be better for them to become proprietors, so that they would have the advantage of",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",247
"248","selling the fish at the best price.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",248
"249","18923. Can you suggest any improvement that the Government might introduce for the sake of the fishermen?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",249
"250","—Well, there is one thing Government might introduce, and that is to have proper harbours of refuge in the dark nights when the boats are out, and it comes very rough weather we cannot see, and there is no light to direct us, and the men might be cast away. We have great need of a light to lead us in.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",250
"251","18924. You want lighthouses and harbours of refuge?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",251
"252","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",252
"253","18925. Have you considered about whether there is any particular place about here where a harbour could be made?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",253
"254","—We have a good harbour here if we had good piers. There are curers coming down from the south making enlargements and better piers, but a light is the thing we require in this harbour in dark nights when we are coming in; once we get into the harbour we are safe enough.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",254
"255","18926. You said you thought it would be an improvement if the different holdings were fenced off one from another?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",255
"256","—I think so, according to my own idea.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",256
"257","18927. But what sort of fence do you think would be the best between small holdings—a wire fence, a stone fence, or a turf fence? ",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",257
"258","—I think a small wire fence would be well enough between the small crofts.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",258
"259","18928. But it gives no shelter?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",259
"260","—No, of course not.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",260
"261","18929. Do you think there is any advantage in a stone dyke over a wire fence?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",261
"262","—Well, the soil here is so deep you cannot get a proper foundation to build a stone dyke on; you have to build it on the top of a marsh.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",262
"263","18930. Are there many stones in the ground?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",263
"264","—Not where I am. There can be no sort of fence where I am except a wire fence. But there are other places where they could put up stone fences.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",264
"265","18931. Is there any other remark you wish to make before you retire?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",265
"266","—None.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",266
"267","18932. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",267
"268","—What quantity of meal do you get for £10? Do you buy it by the hundredweight?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",268
"269","—No, by the boll.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",269
"270","18933. What do you pay for it?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",270
"271","—Different prices; sometimes from 16s. to 18s. a boll.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",271
"272","18934. Wheat flour?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",272
"273","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",273
"274","18935. Brown flour?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",274
"275","—Yes.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",275
"276","18936. And oatmeal?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",276
"277","—From 20s. to 25s. for a boll.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",277
"278","18937. This last year?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",278
"279","—No.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",279
"280","18938. When?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",280
"281","—19s. to 20s. last year.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",281
"282","18939. And you use flour more than oatmeal?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",282
"283","—Just half and half always.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",283
"284","18940. Professor Mackinnon.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",284
"285","—Do you think that if you had had a light three years ago, lives would have been saved?",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",285
"286","—No, I don't think the light would have done any good in that way, the sea being so heavy. The loss of life mostly took place before the boats came to land. But here, in this harbour, coming in in a dark night from the fishing, there would be much good of a light to keep one off the rocks.",341,"James Ormand","Mid Yell, Raefirth",286
