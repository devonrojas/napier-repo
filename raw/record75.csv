"1","DONALD M'KINNON, Crofter and Fisherman, Elgoll (45)—examined. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",1
"2","4223. The Chairman.",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",2
"3","—Have you been freely chosen a delegate by the people of Elgoll ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",3
"4","—Yes. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",4
"5","4224. How long have you been upon your croft?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",5
"6","—About twenty-five years. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",6
"7","4225. Have you any statement to make, written or verbal, on the part of those who have selected you?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",7
"8","—I have a verbal statement to make. We had hill pasture, and it was taken from us about thirty-eight years ago. Then part of our arrears were taken off our account, and three years afterwards were added to our account. We have forty-five families in Elgoll in a township about a mile square, and besides these there are seventeen cottar families in our midst. There are forty-five paying rent. We are only in a poor condition for want of a place that will support us, and we are much in need of land if we could get it; and between the crofters and the cottars on our place, we would occupy very much more land than we have if we could get it. There are eight townships about us which had been cleared, and we were placed on that point. There is beside us a township, Keppoch, from which forty-four families were removed, and sixteen of them were sent away to Australia. Five of these families were placed among us in ElgolL This was in 1852. From some of the crofters of Elgoll land was taken to accommodate those families who were placed among us, and these are cottars to-day, their forefathers having been crofters paying rent. We are three miles from the highway, and we can only bring supplies for our families either on our backs by land or by boat when we have the opportunity. We bring our supplies from Broadford, which is sixteen miles away from us.(see Appendix A. XIII)",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",8
"9","4226. Sheriff Nicolson.",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",9
"10","—How far does the highroad go ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",10
"11","—There are about eleven miles only of roadway from Broadford towards us. Three miles of the distance between us and the roadway is through rocky land, without even a footway. Our shore is exposed; it is very rough,—the only place where we can haul up our boats. The schoolhouse was erected on the place where we would be hauling up our boats and drying our nets, and there is now no place where we can perform either of these operations. We are in a very stormy place, our houses being now and again unroofed with the wind. We cannot get thatch. No thatch grows on our own place. We only get thatch by stealing it from the neighbouring tacksman—Mr Bower. We are confined on a square mile of land—close upon 400 souls—and the tacksman with whom we are marching has six miles of extent of country for himself. The whole estate is in the hands of two tacksmen, except the square mile which we have. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",11
"12","4227. The Chairman.",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",12
"13","—What do you mean by the whole estate ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",13
"14","— Strath-Aird, belonging to Mr Alexander Macallister. The only thing we require is extended holdings out of which we can make our living. We cannot make a living off the land at all. It has become exhausted. It has been constantly cultivated since the time of our forefathers, close upon the last 100 years. I myself sowed three bolls of oats, and the return which I got would not exceed one boll. I have not seen a pound of meal of my own manufacture during the last twenty-five years during which I was in possession of my holding; and for the sort of stock which I have, I have to bring feeding from Glasgow and Greenock. Besides that my own family are out £30 in food. If I could now get the land it would be better for me to have to pay £20 of rent for what I could make a living out of. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",14
"15","4228. Mr Cameron.",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",15
"16","—What rent do you pay for your croft?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",16
"17","— £2, 14s. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",17
"18","4229. What stock have you on the croft?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",18
"19","—Two cows and a two-year old is the summing, but the land would not support these at all",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",19
"20","4230. How many acres have you of arable land to winter these animals ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",20
"21","—About three acres, but we don't turn that. We don't cultivate all that. It has become exhausted. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",21
"22","4231. How much of that do you cultivate?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",22
"23","—About two acres, and some of that is not more than an inch of soil, overlying rocks, and during rains the sea for a quarter of a mile from our shore is turned red with the soil washed off our land. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",23
"24","4232. What hill grazing have you in common?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",24
"25","—A corner of the hill which is very rocky. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",25
"26","4233. Do you mean that you have not enough arable ground to winter the two cows, or that you have not enough summering ground to graze them ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",26
"27","—We have not enough ground either to summer or winter them. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",27
"28","4234. Do you consider the rent you pay too high ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",28
"29","—Yes, I think so, for all the good we are taking out of the ground. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",29
"30","4235. What do you consider would be a fair rent for that land ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",30
"31","—I cannot say much, because we are not taking our living out of it. We depend upon fishing and work. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",31
"32","4236. May what you have stated in regard to yourself be applied to the other crofters, your neighbours ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",32
"33","—Yes, and some of them are worse off. In some instances there are three in one lot. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",33
"34","4237. Are they in very poor circumstances?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",34
"35","—They are as poor as people can be. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",35
"36","4238. How long has this poverty existed ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",36
"37","—About thirty years; since the potatoes faded first. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",37
"38","4239. Were they as bad twenty, or say thirty years ago, as they are now ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",38
"39","—When the land is going back we are going back also. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",39
"40","4240. Would you compare the condition of the people ten years ago with what it is at present?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",40
"41","—They are very much worse off to-day. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",41
"42","4241. In fact, you mean they have been gradually growing worse year by year ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",42
"43","—Yes. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",43
"44","4242. How do you account for that circumstance?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",44
"45","—The want of land; and there is plenty of land beside us if we could only get it. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",45
"46","4243. But they had the same quantity of land ten or twenty years ago, and how do you account for their being worse off now than they were at that time ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",46
"47","—The ground is getting weak. We are turning it every year. Some turn it twice a year—much of it; and there is no land but what is lying on the top of rocks. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",47
"48","4244. I can quite understand your croft is getting worse, but is it possible for any man to depend upon croft land of so small a size as that which you describe?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",48
"49","—I don't think it possible. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",49
"50","4245. Even If it were good land ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",50
"51","—Even if it were good land; there is not enough of it. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",51
"52","4246. Then, that being so, and it being impossible for a man to live by a small croft, even on good land, how is it that the people are so much worse off than they were ten or twenty years ago ? Is it that they take less work ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",52
"53","—That the land is not yielding its crop, it is being turned so often,",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",53
"54","—the bits that we have. We cannot leave out a bit of it. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",54
"55","4247. But you say that if the croft were good land, still you would not be able to earn a living from it, it is so small?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",55
"56","—Yes, I could not take a living out of American land of the same size. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",56
"57","4248. But you had the same quantity ten or twenty years ago, and were much better off: how do you account for that circumstance ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",57
"58","—That the land was yielding more crop. I was not under the necessity of buying so much food either for myself or my family. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",58
"59","4249. What work do you get?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",59
"60","—Fishing. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",60
"61","4250. No other work ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",61
"62","—We get no work from our landlord. We have to work in other countries",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",62
"63","—the east coast and Ireland. It is from there we make our living. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",63
"64","4251. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",64
"65","—You have described your place as a very bad place. You cannot draw your boats on the shore ; you cannot spread your nets on land; it is so stormy that the roofs are blown off the houses; the land is so poor that the sod has only 2 inches of depth. Would it be desirable to continue in that place even if the land were extended ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",65
"66","— The rest of the estate is better than that if we could get it. If we could only be allowed to encroach upon the tacks for three miles, we would take a living out of it where our forefathers were. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",66
"67","4252. Would you prefer to shift your houses to a place where you could draw the boats and shift the nets ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",67
"68","—Yes, if we could get the land along with it. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",68
"69","4253. You would prefer that to staying where you are without increase of rent?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",69
"70","—Yes, to be near a roadway for the place is so difficult of access. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",70
"71","4254. Thirty-eight years ago, when your hill pasture was taken away, you said there were arrears of rent upon you. Were your arrears very heavy at that time?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",71
"72","—No, there was not much. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",72
"73","4255. Do you know what amount of arrears were taken off and put on again?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",73
"74","—A neighbour of mine informed me that 37s. was taken off each croft, and that that was laid upon him again at the end of two years. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",74
"75","4256. Do you mean that every crofter was in arrears at that time ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",75
"76","—I don't think that every crofter was in arrears. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",76
"77","4257. Was it a reduction of rent you mean, or a taking off of arrears ? ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",77
"78","—It was a reduction of rent. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",78
"79","4258. Not an abatement of arrears?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",79
"80","—No. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",80
"81","4259. Are you heavily in arrears to the proprietor?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",81
"82","—No, not one shilling. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",82
"83","4260. Does your answer apply to the whole community as well as yourself ? ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",83
"84","—I believe that all of us are in the same condition. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",84
"85","4261. Are the people much in debt for meal ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",85
"86","—I am sure they are; we paid for our meal last winter, and we now get on credit what we require up to the next time of payment ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",86
"87","4262. Were you clear after last winter?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",87
"88","—Some are not clear. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",88
"89","4263. And those that are not clear, are they getting meal from the merchants still ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",89
"90","—Some of them are, and some are not. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",90
"91","4264. How are those living who don't get credit?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",91
"92","—The neighbour who is in good credit assists the one who has not. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",92
"93","4265. Are there many who require such assistance at the present time ? ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",93
"94","—About six or seven families in our township. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",94
"95","4266. Do you remember a time when there were no people who ever required that sort of assistance through the winter and spring ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",95
"96","—Yes, I remember that ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",96
"97","4267. In your early years was it a very unusual thing that there should be any people who required help from their neighbours ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",97
"98","—Yes. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",98
"99","4268. A very unusual thing?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",99
"100","—Yes, very uncommon. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",100
"101","4269. Then you think the condition of the people is now very much worse than it was when you were young?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",101
"102","—Yes, I know that it is. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",102
"103","4270. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",103
"104","—Who is your proprietor ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",104
"105","—Mr Alexander Macallister. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",105
"106","4271. Does he stay upon the property?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",106
"107","—No. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",107
"108","4272. How long is it since any proprietor has stayed upon it? Do you recollect any resident proprietor?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",108
"109","—Not in my recollection. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",109
"110","4273. Have you ever seen your proprietor?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",110
"111","—Yes. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",111
"112","4274. When ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",112
"113","—About forty years ago. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",113
"114","4275. You have stated that, besides Elgoll, there are two farms upon the estate. Will you name these two farms, and the names of the tenants ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",114
"115","—Kirkibost and Kilmorie. They form one tack under Mr Bower, and Camusunary is the other tack in the possession of Mr Laidlaw. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",115
"116","4276. And these two tacks, and your own place of Elgoll, occupied by the crofters, constitute the estate ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",116
"117","—Yes. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",117
"118","4277. Is Strathaird a big estate?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",118
"119","—It will be about six miles in length. [About 14,000 Scotch acres.] ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",119
"120","4278. How much of these 14,000 Scots acres do the people of Elgoll occupy either as hill or as arable land ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",120
"121","—About a square mile. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",121
"122","4279. Have some of the people now in Elgoll who have now no crofts— who are cottars—have they at some former period had crofts, or are they the descendants of people who had crofts in other places?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",122
"123","—Some of them are the descendants of those who were paying rent. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",123
"124","4280. And the others ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",124
"125","—The others never had any land at all. 4281. I understand that on Elgoll there are four hundred people altogether ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",125
"126","—Yes. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",126
"127","4282. Have you any idea what the population is upon the other parts of the estate occupied by the two farms?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",127
"128","—About seven families. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",128
"129","4283. On the whole of the rest of the estate?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",129
"130","—Yes. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",130
"131","4284. Is a good deal of the land, or some of the land, at any rate, upon those two tacks good land, suitable for cultivation ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",131
"132","—Yes. Was not that land which our forefathers had, cultivating it? ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",132
"133","4285. Sheriff Nicolson.",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",133
"134","—Is it fine land ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",134
"135","—Yes, fine good land, which our forefathers had. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",135
"136","4286. Beautiful green braes ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",136
"137","—It was once beautiful and green, but it is now getting under moss. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",137
"138","4287. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",138
"139","—You were born in Skye ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",139
"140","—Yes ; I am a Skyeman to my backbone. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",140
"141","4288. Was Strathaird part of the old heritage of the Mackinnons ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",141
"142","— Yes. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",142
"143","42S9. Are you aware that the Mackinnons were a distinct clan, and could raise a number of men in old times who could take the field ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",143
"144","— Yes, and I am of that myself. I am a Mackinnon myself; and if my services should be needed, I am ready to stand for my country at any time. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",144
"145","4290. You stated that you are not in arrears of rent. Was that rent got out of the croft, or was it really got from labour abroad or from fishing ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",145
"146","—The rent was not taken out of the croft. It was earned at fishing. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",146
"147","4291. You mentioned something about a school being placed in a locality where they used to draw their nets. By whose authority was that school placed there ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",147
"148","—The school board. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",148
"149","4292. Is there no place in the neighbourhood that would be suitable for a school ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",149
"150","—Yes, plenty of it. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",150
"151","[Rev. Donald Mackinnon, minister of Strath.",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",151
"152","—I should like to make an explanation, if I am not out of order. It happened that I was the party who laid out the site of this school. All the tenants in the place were naturally anxious. There was no place outside the boundaries of the farm that seemed more suitable for a school in this particular locality unless we interfered with the crofts. That we were very anxious to avoid; and to make things as pleasant and smooth as possible, I called a meeting of the people,—and the people of the village were there, I think the most of them,—and they all agreed to this place, which had been the site of a school fifty years ago, and was the garden of the schoolmaster who was then supported there by the Gaelic School Society. It was simply, at the time we took possession of it, a tithing-fold for cattle. The people then had docks for their boats, beyond which they never drew them inland—places made for the boats in the bank, where they secured the boats for the winter. We took the ground so as not to interfere with that. We left that untouched, and went considerably above it, so that we did not in any way interfere with that ground. In consequence, unfortunately, of the great tide we had two years ago, the tide encroached upon their docks and upon the school grounds, but there is no reason to say that we in any way took possession of the ground they were accustomed to use for their boats. I don't suppose there was ever such a thing known as the necessity for bringing a boat in upon the ground we occupied, and at the very time, or shortly before that, the remains of the old schoolhouse were standing upon that very ground.](see Appendix A. XIII)",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",152
"153","4293 Mr Fraser Mackintosh.",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",153
"154","—Is Elgoll a good place for fishing?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",154
"155","—Witness. Yes. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",155
"156","4294. Could anything be done at a moderate expense in the way of a quay for running out and in in time of stormy weather, and for hauling up their boats alongside?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",156
"157","—It is not a very suitable place for a quay or place of that sort, but it could be made very much better than it is. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",157
"158","4295. You complain of the roads—do you pay road assessment ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",158
"159","—Yes. We are paying road money to the county of Inverness, and we have not a road at all ourselves. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",159
"160","4296. The Chairman.",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",160
"161","—You stated there was a great deal of good land upon the tacksmen's farms—fine green knowes or hillocks which formerly were arable. Do you consider that, having been so long out of cultivation, it has deteriorated, or do you consider it has improved by the rest it has had ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",161
"162","—It is getting worse the longer it is left out of cultivation, and it would be improved if it were brought under cultivation for pasture, ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",162
"163","4297. But is it getting better for cultivation if it were now broken up ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",163
"164","—Yes. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",164
"165","4298. Upon the crofts, in your place, has there been any attempt made to improve the arable ground by deep trenching with the pick ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",165
"166","—No, the ground was so hard. It is dry enough, but we would be afraid to improve, in case we would be turned out by the landlord or factor. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",166
"167","4299. Have you ever seen the pick used at all ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",167
"168","—No, not on our land. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",168
"169","4300. Sheriff Nicolson.",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",169
"170","—Is there any man from Elgoll in the army just now ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",170
"171","—Yes. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",171
"172","4301. More than one ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",172
"173","—Only one at present ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",173
"174","4302. Are there any pensioners?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",174
"175","—-There are no pensioners. ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",175
"176","4303. How do the cottars live there ?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",176
"177","—One of them is here present ",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",177
"178","4304. Where do they get work?",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",178
"179","—They don't get work at all. They live by fishing and by cultivating bits of ground they get from the crofters. They are a burden upon the crofters.",75,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Broadford",179
