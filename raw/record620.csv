"17","—I lived in Forse till I was thirty-one years of age.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",17

"19","—Yes.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",19
"20","37460. What statement have you to make on behalf of the people of Forse?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",20
"21","—I have a statement to make that they were evicted twenty-five years ago. Five families were evicted in one day in the upper end of Forse.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",21
"22","37461. Who was the proprietor?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",22

"24","37462. What was the ground for removing them?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",24

"26","37463. What was their rent?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",26
"27","—Their rent was £13, and then he raised it to £18.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",27

"29","—No, not at all.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",29
"30","37465. Then was it raised again from £18 still higher when they were removed?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",30
"31","—No, he wanted no more; but he wanted to clear them out, and he said he would get the whole tenants cleared.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",31
"32","37466. Had they not good houses before?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",32

"34","37467. What kind of houses had they?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",34
"35","—Divot roofs and what they call Highland couples—the cattle and themselves going in at the same door. They lived all under the same roof, only there was an old sail between the animals and the fire.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",35
"36","37468. And he wanted them to build better houses'",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",36

"38","37469. Was there any other ground of complaint against the people?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",38
"39","—No ground.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",39
"40","37470. Had they been cultivating their lands?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",40
"41","—They did cultivate them. It was because they cultivated the land that he put the rise on them. That was what they got for cultivating the land.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",41
"42","37471. Had they made improvements?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",42
"43","—A great deal of improvements, but some of them did not.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",43
"44","37472. Were there only five crofters removed?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",44
"45","—There were five removed in one day. There were eight removed, but there were five removed in one day; the roof was off, and they had to go.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",45
"46","37473. Who got their crofts?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",46
"47","—He had them for three years in his own hand, and no one offered for them.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",47
"48","37474. How is the place occupied now?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",48
"49","—It is occupied now, I believe, at less rent than the tenants were paying then.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",49
"50","37475. As a farm?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",50
"51","—It is in two farms now.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",51
"52","37476. What was the name of the place where you lived?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",52
"53","—Stemster, Forse, in the parish of Latheron. They had no place to go to unless they went to the churchyard that was near. They stopped in the barns, but they were evicted out of the barns after that.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",53
"54","37477. Where did they go to?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",54
"55","—Some went to the parish of Halkirk, and most of them turned to be paupers after the little money they made out of their subject was gone.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",55
"56","37478. Were there any other evictions made at that time?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",56
"57","—There were made in all one hundred and five evictions about that same time from that same estate. That was about the beginning of it. There were one hundred and five upon the estate evicted.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",57
"58","37479. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",58
"59","—Do you mean families?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",59
"60","—Yes, crofters and cottars.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",60
"61","37480. Sheriff Nicolson.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",61
"62","—By the same laird who is there now?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",62
"63","—Yes. There is most of it under sheep. There is one place where thirty-five were evicted for one farm.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",63
"64","37481. What is the name of that farm?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",64
"65","—The farm of Rumster.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",65
"66","37482. Is there a higher rent being paid now than was paid before?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",66
"67","—No, I do not believe it is higher now. The tenants were giving more rent.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",67
"68","37483. To what part of the world did all these one hundred families go, do you know?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",68
"69","—I believe most of them went to be paupers; I attended the funerals of a good many of them from the poorhouse, and they just got nothing but the funeral of an ass.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",69
"70","37484. Then the representations you have been asked to make here are not on behalf of the present crofters of Forse, but in respect of what has been done there?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",70
"71","—The present ones have put me in as a delegate. ",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",71
"72","37485. How many have been left there?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",72
"73","—There are very few of the old ones. There are some down at the fishings below the road. There are a few of them still in it.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",73
"74","37486. But they have no grievance of their own which they wish you to represent?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",74
"75","—They have grievances of their own. The land is three times rented owing to the sea. It is on the sea they put the rents. They pay the rent for the sea, not for the land.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",75
"76","37487. Are you the only person here to represent them?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",76
"77","—No, there is another to represent them.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",77
"78","37488. Is he living on the property of Forse?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",78
"79","—No, he is not. He was put off twenty-five years ago. He was one of those one hundred and five who were put out. His aunt was evicted that same day she,was on her deathbed. She was put out by the police and the sheriff officer under the factor, and was for eight days under a sail, and then she was taken away, and about two months afterwards she died on another estate.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",79
"80","37489. These are interesting facts, but have you nothing to say in regard to the present crofters?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",80
"81","—-Their grievance is that the rent is too high.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",81
"82","37490. What is the rate of the rent per acre?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",82
"83","—I cannot tell. There are those here who can tell about it.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",83
"84","37491. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",84
"85","—In what part of the parish of Latheron is Forse estate?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",85
"86","—About the centre of the parish.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",86
"87","37492. Is it far from where we are just now?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",87
"88","—About one and a half miles south from where we are.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",88
"89","37493. Is it a large estate?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",89
"90","—It is two and a half miles in length and seven miles long.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",90
"91","37494. What was the meaning of those extraordinary evictions that took place on the estate? What was the object in doing it?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",91
"92","—I believe it was owing to his father-in-law and his wife. They were Irish, and he had to give in to their way. There was an old man who died —I believe he was a pauper—and they came in and told Forse that he was dead. Shepherd, his father-in-law, was there, and he said—Yes, George, that is right; that is the way they should go.'",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",92
"93","37495. Are you quite correct in saying there were 105 families? Do you mean heads of families?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",93
"94","—Yes, I mean all smoking houses —cottars and small places.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",94
"95","37496. How many heads of families of that class may there be upon the estate now?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",95
"96","—Well, there are very few on it now except what are at the fishing. There are none but two that were put out, but they are lying on the face of the hill miserable, worse than if they were out with the tinkers.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",96
"97","37497. With regard to the place where you are now living, upon Mrs Gunn's estate, you do not represent the people on that estate?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",97
"98","—No.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",98
"99","37498. Is there any complaint from that estate?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",99
"100","—We have no complaint but that we are, like all the rest, too high rented by the proprietor, that has owned the land since twenty-five years ago, and we are paying the rent that they were paying for it then. I may say we are all double rented.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",100
"101","37499. Are you a fisherman as well as a crofter?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",101
"102","—No.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",102
"103","37500. You say that of those families that were evicted from Forse a great many became paupers and died. Were many obliged to emigrate and leave the country?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",103
"104","—I believe there were very few that emigrated. There was very little emigration at that time.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",104
"105","37501. Where did they go to then?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",105
"106","—Most of them that are living are on the estate that I am on. Their parents are dead, and they became paupers, because they had nothing to support them.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",106
"107","37502. Who was the proprietor at the time who took the poor people on the estate of Latheron?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",107
"108","—Munro had most of it then.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",108
"109","37503. Did he take them out of kindness, or what were the circumstances under which they came to this estate?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",109
"110","—It was small places that were on the estate of Latheron then, and any of them that got better places removed and went to other places and made the best shift they could, because it was a place that had nothing but rocks on it, and all the green on it was not fit to be cultivated.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",110
"111","37504. The Chairman.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",111
"112","—What is the name of the proprietor now—Sutherland of Forse?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",112
"113","—Yes,",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",113
"114","37505. Is it the same gentleman who made these evictions?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",114
"115","—Yes, it is he who is living still.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",115
"116","37506. Does he ever live in the country?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",116
"117","—He has lived in Ireland ever since the evictions, unless he comes for a short time. He may come for a night or two. The last time he was in Caithness was at the time of last election.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",117
"118","37507. Is it an old family in the country, or did they buy the estate?",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",118
"119","—They ran from generation to generation for I believe the memory of man; but we had good proprietors in that family—as good as were in Caithness—until he came.",620,"George Sinclair","Caithness, Lybster",119
