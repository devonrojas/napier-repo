"1","JOHN M'RAE, Cottar and Fisherman, Soay (35)—examined.",121,"John Mcrae","Skye, Bracadale",1
"2","6354. The Chairman.",121,"John Mcrae","Skye, Bracadale",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected a delegate by the people of Soay ?",121,"John Mcrae","Skye, Bracadale",3
"4","—Yes. ",121,"John Mcrae","Skye, Bracadale",4
"5","6355. You have heard what the last witness has stated respecting the condition of the people on the island. Did you understand the statement, and do you agree with it?",121,"John Mcrae","Skye, Bracadale",5
"6","—Yes. ",121,"John Mcrae","Skye, Bracadale",6
"7","6356. Have you something to add to that statement ?",121,"John Mcrae","Skye, Bracadale",7
"8","—Yes, I have to say, in the first place, that I could not put down either potatoes or oats in my ground this year, as the ground is so soft—nothing but peats and bogs, and I could not get back what I put into it. I am for the past twenty years getting ground from others in which to plant my potatoes and sow my oats, and my father was for thirty-five years the same way. I have no place on which to build a house. My present house is built on the township, and the tide rises to it, and every stormy night that comes I have to watch and put out all the furniture—such as it is. A sister of mine was employed one night last winter putting out the furniture, and she was sickly, and she died in consequence of hurting herself that night. I tried with carrying some peat soil on my back to make up soil on my ground, but it defied me. I have to pave a way for my cow with stones through my lot in order to get out to the hill, otherwise she would get drowned. She would never have got her feet out of the ground, it is so soft. I do not think I have anything more to say. I have been through England, Scotland, Ireland, and France, and I have not seen such an awful place for people to be living in as Soay.

"12","—Do you concur with the last witness that the only remedy is to be removed off the island altogether ?",121,"John Mcrae","Skye, Bracadale",12
"13","—Yes. We take our meal from Broadford, and it costs 5s. a bag, to the Loch Slapin, and from there we have eighteen miles by boat to Soay ; and it may happen I have to spend 15s. to £1 for lodgings in going for this meal, should bad weather come, and those at home may be starving. No person can believe the sort of place it is unless he has seen it. ",121,"John Mcrae","Skye, Bracadale",13
"14","6359. Have you asked the tacksman or proprietor for a place to build a new house ?",121,"John Mcrae","Skye, Bracadale",14
"15","—I don't remember I asked him for a place to build a house in, but a brother of mine asked him for a stance to build a house, and he built a house near my place, and the tide destroyed it, and he died himself. ",121,"John Mcrae","Skye, Bracadale",15
