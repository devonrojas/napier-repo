"1","NORMAN M'LEAN, Crofter, Balchuirn, Raasay (40)—examined.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",1
"2","8192. The Chairman.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected a delegate by the people of Balchuirn?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",3
"4","—Yes.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",4
"5","8193. Will you make a statement on the part of the people of Balchuirn?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",5
"6","—As has been already heard here, we have too little land, and that is too dear and bad. It is very much spoiled with game, and especially with rabbits. The rabbits alone would keep down our crop without any other game.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",6
"7","8194. Are there not wire fences—rabbit fences—put round your crops!",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",7
"8","—Every man's arable land is cut out for him, and as lots varied in the quality of the soil, so the rents varied, and the stock they had was in common. They had the hill pasture in common. A good part of the ground was taken from them.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",8
"9","8195. Do you mean the hill pasture or the arable?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",9
"10","—The hill pasture, and this necessitated the taking off from the stock one cow and one horse and about forty sheep, each lot. ",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",10
"11","8196. What is the summing now? ",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",11
"12","— We are trying to keep four cows, but they do not get justice.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",12
"13","8197. How many sheep?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",13
"14","—None at all.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",14
"15","8198. Any stirks?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",15
"16","—None at all.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",16
"17","8199. How much arable ground have you?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",17
"18","—I think it would be altogether three acres.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",18
"19","8200. What is your rent?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",19
"20","—£5, 17s. exclusive of rates.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",20
"21","8201. Are you near the sea-shore ?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",21
"22","—No, we are about a mile from the sea-shore.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",22
"23","8202. Do you get any sea-weed?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",23
"24","—Yes, plenty. Some of it we have to take three or four miles by sea.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",24
"25","8203. Do you pay for it?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",25
"26","—No. It was not Mr Wood who deprived us of the hill pasture or raised our rents.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",26
"27","8204. It was Mackay?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",27
"28","—It was Mr Rainy who took the hill pasture from us. He took part of the ground from us, and Mr Mackay took the rest; and then Mr Armitage raised our rents. When we were having our lots relotted in Mr Armitage's time, our lots were raised £6 over the whole township.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",28
"29","8205. Has the rent been raised since then?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",29
"30","—No. That rise took place the year before Mr Wood became proprietor about seven years ago.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",30
"31","8206. Then do you agree generally with what has been said before by the other delegates?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",31
"32","—Yes. As to the houses in this island, every man at first built his own house, and it belonged to himself; and if he happened to leave the lot, his successor in the lot took over his house at a valuation. It was at that time I got my lot, and it was a bad house that was on it, not fit for human habitation. I was asking, as it was in that condition, and I would have to rebuild it, to break it down and value it as a broken house, and I got a letter from the factor that I was not to be allowed to rob my predecessor, and if I would not take the house at a valuation, he would find a man who would do so. I then got the house at the valuation that was made.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",32
"33","8207. How much ?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",33
"34","—It was £4 when it was valued, and I rebuilt the house at my own expense; and if it would get so much land along with it at a fair value —that is as much as I could cultivate and stock —the house would do.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",34
"35","8208. How much could you stock?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",35
"36","—I would stock the township as it was before, should I get the ground that was along with it.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",36
"37","8209. If you got pasture enough for twenty sheep, could you stock it with twenty sheep?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",37
"38","—Yes.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",38
"39","8210. Professor Mackinnon",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",39
"40","—How many pay rent in the town?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",40
"41","—Six",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",41
"42","8211. And their grievance is that the rent is too high?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",42
"43","—Yes.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",43
"44","8212. That the place is too small?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",44
"45","—Yes.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",45
"46","8213. And infested with rabbits?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",46
"47","—Yes.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",47
"48","8214. Why don't you trap the rabbits?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",48
"49","—We have no traps.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",49
"50","8215. Why don't you buy a trap?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",50
"51","—I believe we are not allowed to keep dog or gun or trap, or anything in that way.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",51
"52","8216. Did you ask permission to trap?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",52
"53","—No, but I know we have no liberty to keep dogs.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",53
"54","8217. Are there any other game that injure the crofters?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",54
"55","—Yes, but they are the worst.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",55
"56","8218. How many would you say that this place, where there are six now, should hold?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",56
"57","—Well, there were six in it before.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",57
"58","8219. Do you think it would keep six families if the hill pasture were given back?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",58
"59","—Yes, the same as before, along with their town earnings.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",59
"60","8220. What was the rent of the township before the hill pasture was taken away?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",60
"61","—£33 now, and I think it was £35 before.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",61
"62","8221. There was only £2 taken off when the pasture was taken away?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",62
"63","—When Mr Rainy took it from them, he gave them £ 9 down.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",63
"64","8222. And you think the hill pasture was worth at least £9?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",64
"65","—Yes, and more.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",65
"66","8223. How many sheep could you keep when you had the hill pasture?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",66
"67","— Forty, and a horse and a cow.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",67
"68","8224. For each of six families?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",68
"69","—Yes.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",69
"70","8225. Would your neighbours be able to stock that place as well as you?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",70
"71","—Well, I think the most of them would.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",71
"72","8226. And you think, if you got that hill pasture back again, you would be quite comfortable?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",72
"73","—Yes.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",73
"74","8227. Did you ever ask it back?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",74
"75","—No.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",75
"76","8228. Why not?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",76
"77","—I am not sure.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",77
"78","8229. You know the place well enough—is there a fence upon it now?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",78
"79","—There is a fence from the place where we have the houses, but the rest of our cultivated ground is not fenced, and, even if that were fenced, we would be little better off than we are. We would require to have something to winter our cows.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",79
"80","8230. Would it cost much to add that hill pasture back to your township again?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",80
"81","—Yes ; of course, I don't think it did any good to the sheep farm, but still it was standing in the way, and it would require to be fenced in all along.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",81
"82","8231. If the proprietor were disposed to give the hill pasture back to you again, could that be done without much expense?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",82
"83","—No, there is not much of the landlord's stock coming on that hill, neither is the hill very enticing to our stock, and the stock might be looked after by a herd.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",83
"84","8232. Are there many of the young people going to the south to work?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",84
"85","—-Oh, there are not very many young people there. They belong to this end of the land.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",85
"86","8233. Are there many people from Rona and Raasay who work in the south, apart from fishing",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",86
"87","—young men and women?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",87
"88","—Not many who work ashore. They go to the fishing mostly.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",88
"89","8234. Do the young women all remain at home?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",89
"90","—No.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",90
"91","8235. Where do they go?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",91
"92","—Out to the towns.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",92
"93","8236. And do they all come back again?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",93
"94","—Sometimes they come to see their friends for a fortnight or three weeks.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",94
"95","8237. And some do not come back at all?",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",95
"96","—That is the way. Mr Wood is very kind to us, but Mr Wood will not last always; and we may be",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",96
"97","deprived of the benefits of his kindness at any time.",155,"Norman Mclean","Raasay, Torran",97
