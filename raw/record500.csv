"1","FINLAY M'BEATH, Crofter, Deruner (64)—examined.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",1
"2","29710. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",2
"3","—What statement have you to make ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",3
"4","—At a meeting held by us on the 23rd day of July 1883, we, the crofters of Deruner, on the estate of Mr Murray of Lochcarron, proposed to place the following grievances before the Royal Commission :",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",4
"5","—First, that twenty years ago our hill pasture was turned into a deer forest. Since that time we were not allowed to keep one single sheep, and in about one third of our arable ground we can sow nothing whatever as it is completely overrun with deer; but notwithstanding all this we pay exactly the same rent now as we did when we had sheep, and our crops were not destroyed by deer.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",5
"6","Secondly, that the deer every year destroy our crops, and if we preserve anything from them it is by watching the whole night, by the doing of which we are prevented from earning a livelihood elsewhere. We scarcely sent a grain to the mill during the last twenty years, and often we are compelled to buy oat seed. Thirdly, that we repeatedly asked our former proprietor, Mr Stewart, to fence our land under such conditions as he himself might choose, but were as often refused. Subsequently we offered to fence it ourselves on condition that we should get compensation for the outlay in case of our leaving or being removed from the place. No such promise, however, would be given us. Since all the townships around us have been fenced our condition is doubly worse. We cannot understand why our township alone is left without a fence. Fourthly, we are not even allowed to take ewes for wintering on our arable ground as other crofters on the estate are. We may add that our forefathers lived on this estate from time immemorial, and so far as we ever heard or knew,  behaved themselves always in strict accordance with law and order. Our demands are very reasonable, viz.,",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",6
"7","(1) permission to have a few sheep ;",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",7
"8","(2) a fence to protect our crops from the deer.'",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",8

"15","29714. Are there other villages on the same property that are fenced ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",15

"17","29715. But are there townships occupied by crofters that are fenced in your neighbourhood ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",17

"43","—No. ",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",43
"44","29728. How was it occupied?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",44
"45","—It was hill pasture for crofters. They had it the same way as they had the low ground.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",45
"46","29729. How many crofters had the right to put their animals on it ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",46

"48","29730. What was the name of these two townships ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",48

"52","29732. Do you know if a similar practice was adopted towards the other townships which had right to the grazing ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",52
"53","—I cannot tell; but I know the rents were raised all round at that time.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",53
"54","29733. Do you also know that the subject let to you was all reduced at the time the forest was made ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",54

"63","—Mackenzie of Applecross.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",63
"64","29738. Do you recollect when the Applecross estate was belonging to one proprietor ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",64
"65","—Yes.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",65
"66","29739. Was there any forest, strictly so-called, upon the part of Applecross now belonging to Lord Middleton ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",66

"68","29710. Do you know a place called Auchuashellach ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",68

"87","—Right opposite from where ws are,",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",87
"88","29750. How many miles?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",88
"89","—It is just right opposite the steamer; it is not a mile by sea; it is three miles by land.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",89
"90","29751. Have you asked your present proprietor, or made any complaint to him that you are without this fence?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",90
"91","—We never asked himself personally, but we asked his servants. He himself has only lately come into the place, and we have not had much opportunity to speak to him.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",91
"92","29752. Is it not always better to go to headquarters when you have the opportunity?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",92

"95","—Yes.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",95

"97","—Yes.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",97
"98","29755. Do you complaiu of anything except this matter of the fence ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",98
"99","—No, and we do not know what he may do about the fence itself; we have nothing to object to as far as he is concerned.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",99
"100","29756. Have you complained more than once to the officials of the estate ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",100
"101","—Oh, yes, more than once; I did once, and there was another  man made a complaint on another occasion.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",101
"102","29757. What was the nature of the answer you got ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",102
"103","—It was the other man that was the spokesman; I was not at home at the time; but he says they refused to put up the fence.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",103
"104","29758. The Chairman.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",104
"105","—How many families were there on the three townships whose common grazing was taken away ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",105
"106","—There would have been about thirty at that time; there are not so many people in this place there were twenty and four and five.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",106
"107","29759. Do the other townships suffer from the deer as well as your own ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",107
"108","—No, the march of the other townships is fenced.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",108
"109","29760. Does the injury from the deer still continue?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",109
"110","—Yes; we sit up every night to watch them.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",110
"111","29761. How long does the injury last during the year —all round, or in a particular period ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",111
"112","—In harvest. When the potatoes appear above the ground they begin to eat them, and continue eating them until the shaws get very big, then they stop. Then they begin again when the corn is ripe; and when the potatoes are ripe they eat the potatoes and continue right on until the crops are closed up.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",112
"113","29762. Has the former or present proprietor ever given you any compensation for actual damage done?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",113
"114","—Nothing,",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",114
"115","29763. Did the former proprietors ever employ a paid watcher to keep the deer off your ground ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",115
"116","—Not since I was born.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",116
"117","29764. If the present proprietor was inclined to put up a deer fence, would you help him in the transport of materials, or by labour, or in any way ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",117
"118","—Yes, we would be very glad to assist him in every way.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",118
"119","29765. Was the forest all made up of this hill grazing of the crofters, or was the hill grazing only added to another larger area?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",119
"120","—The tenants had right to graze over the whole of the land which is now forest; and now a great portion of the low ground, because of the deer, is quite useless to us.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",120
"121","29766. Has this forest ever been let to a tenant ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",121
"122","—I am not aware that it was ever let; it was Sir John Stewart's own sons that used to shoot over it.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",122
"123","29767. Have you any idea what the value of the ground occupied as the forest would be if it was let as a sheep farm or a deer forest ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",123
"124","—I am not able to judge; I have no idea; I am not a very good judge of the value of land.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",124
"125","29768. About how many sheep would it graze ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",125
"126","—We ourselves had one hundred and twenty sheep upon it —the six of us. ",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",126
"127","29769. When the hill grazing was taken away from the other two townships as well as yours was the rent of the other two townships permanently reduced, or was the rent of them raised too?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",127
"128","—Tho rent was reduced the same as ours, but it was afterwards increased the same as ours. The whole of the estate was increased, as far as I am aware at that time.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",128
"129","29770. Then whatever the grazing or forest value of the old common pasture is now, it is a clear gain to the proprietor ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",129
"130","—Yes.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",130
"131","29771. But he has never done anything to benefit the crofters of your township ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",131
"132","—Nothing.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",132

"136","—When did the present proprietor get possession of the estate ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",136
"137","—A year last Whitsunday.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",137
"138","29774. Mr Cameron.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",138
"139","—How many crofters are there at Deruner?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",139
"140","—Five.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",140
"141","29775. What rent do they pay?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",141
"142","—£3, 2s. each.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",142
"143","29776. Were you elected as a delegate by the crofters at Deruner, or by the other crofters in the neighbourhood ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",143
"144","—My own township.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",144
"145","29777. You represent the five crofters and not the rest?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",145
"146","—Yes.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",146
"147","29778. How long would the fence require to be to protect the arable ground of yourself and the other crofters against the deer?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",147
"148","—A mile would cover it —scarcely a mile.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",148
"149","29779. Was it the impression of the people when they sent you to represent this grievance, that the Royal Commission had power to order the fence to be put up ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",149
"150","—I cannot say.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",150
"151","29780. Is it your own impression?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",151
"152","—Well, yes, we thought that perhaps you had the power, that we were to get justice like other people.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",152
"153","29781. Would it be a very difficult fence to erect, this mile.?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",153
"154","—No, not very difficult.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",154
"155","29782. Have you any reason to think that the present proprietor would be unwilling to listen to any reasonable request about it?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",155
"156","—I do not say that he would refuse to put up any reasonable fence.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",156
"157","29783. Did the one hundred and twenty sheep you refer to as having been grazed on this belong to your own township or to the other township besides ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",157
"158","—My own township.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",158
"159","29784. How many sheep, besides the one hundred and twenty grazed, belonging to the other crofters ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",159
"160","—I cannot tell.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",160
"161","29785. Was it more or less?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",161
"162","—In the glen upon the other side of us they had more sheep each than we had.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",162
"163","29786. Can you mention what the number of sheep used to be that belonged to the crofters in former times on the grazings here?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",163
"164","—I can not.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",164
"165","29787. What would be the value of the grazing of one hundred and twenty sheep at the current rates?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",165
"166","—As things go to-day, 3s. a sheep perhaps.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",166
"167","29788. Do you think sheep farms let for 3s. a sheep?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",167
"168","—I cannot undertake to say.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",168
"169","29789. Don't you think that many proprietors would be glad at present if they could get 2s. ?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",169
"170","—Yes, where there are very large places perhaps.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",170
"171","29790. But according to your own view of the value of sheep grazing, that of one hundred and twenty sheep would be £18?",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",171
"172","—We were not looking at it that way; we had the right to the hill as part of our crofts.",500,"Finlay Mcbeath","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",172
