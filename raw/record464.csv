"1","KENNETH MACKENZIE, Crofter, formerly Fisherman, Lots of Scoraig, Little Loch Broom (74), assisted by DUNCAN MACKENZIE, Crofter's Son, Lots of Scoraig (35)—examined.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",1
"2","27754. The Chairman.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",2
"3","—Have you been elected delegates?Duncan Mackenzie. ",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",3
"4","—Yes.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",4
"5","27755. What have you to say?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",5
"6","—In the first place when the township of Lots was formed in 1840 there, twenty men put down having a lot each.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",6
"7","27756. That was the first formation of the Lots?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",7
"8","—The first formation on the Black Moor, the rental for the twenty lots was £5.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",8
"9","27757. £5 each ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",9
"10","—£5 for the whole—5s. for each, that was the case for the first nine years, or, rather, instead of 5s. it was six days' labour. There was no rent paid in money, it was six days' labour, equal to 5s. In nine years the rent and labour was put up to twenty days, and it continued at that till 1884.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",10
"11","27758. Could the twenty days be taken in money instead of labour; was there an alternative ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",11
"12","—-There was no money value put on it then, merely twenty days labour.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",12
"13","27759. Were the people in the habit of affording the labour or offering the money?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",13
"14","—They were supposed to give the twenty days' labour for the rent.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",14
"15","27760. But what did they do generally, labour or money ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",15
"16","—They gave the labour at that time.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",16
"17","27761. Until 1880?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",17
"18","—Yes. In 1880 there was money rental imposed, varying from £2, 12s. 6d., to £3, 10s. per lot, which they considered a very hard case indeed. Instead of raising the rents the people ought to have got compensation for their improvements. They have no communication by road, only by a dangerous rocky mountain which is a hazardous way of travelling even in daylight; and there is no pier to land at with boats. The people wish, if it can be got through the Royal Commissioners, to have a road there which would benefit upwards of sixty families, beginning at Scoraig right through the townships of Lots, Carnoch, Pereoch, Achmore, and Badraloch, and joining the ferry of Dundonnell on  the top of the hill at Mulbuie. They also want more pasture, security of tenure, and reduction of rent. Although I am not an old man I have never seen anything done there by the proprietors to benefit the people, although they have been oppressed.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",18
"19","27762. You mentioned three periods—the first period in which the people received their land during nine years for six days' labour ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",19
"20","—Yes.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",20
"21","27763. Then the second period in which they received their land for twenty days' labour; and in the year 1880 a third period began with a money rental ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",21
"22","—A money rental. ",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",22
"23","27764 During the two first periods the land was actually paid in labour ? ",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",23
"24","—Paid in labour.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",24
"25","27765. When the ground was first apportioned to these people had they a written agreement with the landlord ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",25
"26","—None whatever. ",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",26
"27","27766. But was it explained to them at the time that they were to have their land on an improving lease for lower terms at first and higher terms afterwards ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",27
"28","—Not on these terms. They were put there to make the best of it, and told they would never be put out unless for a crime.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",28
"29","27767. Is there any written statement of that kind ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",29
"30","—No.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",30
"31","27768. Is there any one here who can speak to it ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",31
"32","—I think my father can speak to it.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",32
"33","27769. Would you ask him if he was one of the original settlers ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",33
"34","—Yes, he says he was.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",34
"35","27770. When he received the land originally was any promise made to him that he should remain there on the same terms as regards rent?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",35
"36","[Kenneth Mackenzie]",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",36
"37","—The terms that were given were that we were to have it for nine years for nine days' work.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",37
"38","27771. The other delegate said it was for six days' work; why do you say for nine days' work ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",38
"39","—Then when these nine years were over twenty days' labour was imposed on us.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",39
"40","27772. When you got the land originally were you promised to have it for nine years for nine days' labour ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",40
"41","—There was no promise except that so long as we would not be charged with any crime we would always remain there—the nine days' service was to last for nine years.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",41
"42","27773. Did you understand that at the end of nine years other terms might be made ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",42
"43","—We did not know about that.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",43
"44","27774. What did you expect to happen at the end of the nine years ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",44
"45","—We did not know; anything that the proprietor might choose to impose.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",45
"46","27775. When the nine years were over and the twenty days' were asked what did the people do",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",46
"47","—did they consent to it or make any protest against it?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",47
"48","—They did not oppose i t ; they just accepted the terms and worked the twenty days.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",48
"49","27776. Did they always give it iu work, or did they sometimes give it in money ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",49
"50","—We never gave money.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",50
"51","27777. When the heads of the families were otherwise engaged were they allowed to find substitutes?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",51
"52","—-Yes, a substitute would be accepted.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",52
"53","27778. Was the work exacted from women and men and the whole family, or only the head of the family ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",53
"54","—They would require the services of a man.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",54
"55","27779. When the second period finished in 1880 and the money rent was imposed, what did you do then ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",55
"56","—We just paid the rent.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",56
"57","27780. You did not protest against it?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",57
"58","—We did not protest against it, but the reason of the new arrangement was that we were not able to attend upon the day to give the work which the proprietor wanted; we were engaged in other employment. We were ready to do it upon a subsequent day, but meanwhile the proprietor got rather irritated and said he would not be bothered with conduct like that, and he imposed a money rent.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",58
"59","27781. During the whole period of thirty years that you paid a labour rent, did you receive any assistance from the proprietor in building or improving your houses, or in any other way?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",59
"60","—No, he gave us no assistance.*",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",60
"61","* A voluntary declaration has since been made by this witness to the effect that his answer to question 27781 is not in accordance with facts. See Appendix A, No. LXXI.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",61
"62","27782. No materials for building the house?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",62
"63","—I don't know many that got wood.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",63
"64","27783. Did any get wood?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",64
"65","—I am not aware.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",65
"66","27784. To Duncan Mackenzie.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",66
"67","—Are you aware of any who got assistance in building houses ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",67
"68","—I am not aware.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",68
"69","27785. There were twenty families originally, how many are there now? is there the some number of lots, or have the lots been subdivided?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",69

"74","—I have myself perhaps a little over two acres; some have less and others have about that. ",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",74
"75","27788. How many cows do you keep?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",75
"76","—One head of cattle was put down in my summing when I got the place. ",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",76
"77","27789. How many have you got now?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",77
"78","—I keep two head of cattle. I have no horse nor sheep.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",78
"79","27790. Do you mean a cow and stirk, or two cows?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",79
"80","—Two milk cows.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",80
"81","27791. Have you any stirk?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",81
"82","—Well if I have it is not upon the croft. The croft cannot keep the two cows either. How could it do so when all the pasture we have is just the breadth of the arable ground back on the hill?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",82
"83","27792. Is there any hill pasture?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",83
"84","—No. If the neighbouring places would preserve the marches strictly, the whole twenty of us could not keep ten beasts upon our own pasture.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",84
"85","27793. But as a matter of fact is there some hill pasture upon which you drive out your cows ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",85
"86","—The breadth of the arable land behind.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",86
"87","27794. How far does it go back?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",87
"88","—It goes back the same breadth —it forms a square.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",88
"89","27795. What do you think the croft would really keep itself without buying anything from the outside",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",89
"90","—would it keep one cow ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",90
"91","—Two head of cattle.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",91
"92","27796. So that you have a croft which keeps two head of cattle, and you pay £2, 12s. 6d. ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",92
"93","—The rent of the whole township is £55, my rent is about £ 3 , and others pay more, and some less.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",93
"94","27797. To Duncan Mackenzie.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",94
"95","—You have heard what Kenneth Mackenzie has said, have you any explanation to offer about the six or nine days' labour?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",95
"96","—There are three days I did not take into account—two days for cutting peat3 and one day for harvest",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",96
"97","—besides the six days of manual labour.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",97

"99","—They will, by what grows upon them for winter keep.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",99
"100","27799. And they pay from £2, 12s. 6d. to £3, 10s.?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",100
"101","—Yes, exclusive of taxes. |",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",101
"102","27800. Is that a higher rent than the common custom of the county would warrant?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",102
"103","—Yes. ",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",103
"104","27801. It is a higher rent than usual?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",104
"105","—Yes, the township when we went there was given for £5, taking off Scoraig.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",105
"106","27802. But it must have been a sort of improving lease, on the understanding that when it became better it was to be more ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",106
"107","—There was no agreement to that effect.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",107
"108","27803. Must there not have been something of that kind?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",108
"109","—It is worth more than when they got it",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",109
"110","27804. Do you think they would have objected to pay something more, or it is the additional amount that they complain of?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",110
"111","—It is the additional amount, and the want of pasture for the cattle. They have no place to put cattle behind the dykes, except about fifty yards.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",111
"112","27805. They would be contented to pay more than they paid in the first period of nine years?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",112
"113","—Certainly, if they got pasture. ",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",113
"114","27806. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",114
"115","—Do you represent the people of Scoraig only or other people besides ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",115
"116","—The township of Lots, not Scoraig. ",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",116
"117","27807. Is there not a village of Scoraig ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",117
"118","—Lots was taken off Scoraig, it has been distinctly apart from Scoraig since 1840. ",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",118
"119","27808. Are there delegates from other parts of the Dundonnell property ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",119
"120","—I dont know.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",120
"121","27809. You have no reason to believe there are complaints in other parts ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",121
"122","—I have reason to believe there are, but I cannot speak on that point.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",122
"123","27810. Twenty days' labour was what was latterly given for the croft, I see the proprietor of the estate of Dundonnell estimated the value of the days' labour at 2s. 6d. ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",123
"124","—I don't think they value it so much in the conditions of lease.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",124
"125","27811. They mention that the rate of labour having risen, the twenty days' labour had become worth £2, 10s. What is the value of labour here now-a-days ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",125
"126","—You would not get an able-bodied man to work days' labour under 18s. a week, and provide everything himself.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",126
"127","27812. Then twenty days labour is worth £3 now?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",127
"128","—Yes; certainly, and often they have to waste six weeks in making out twenty days, owing to the bad weather.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",128
"129","27813. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",129

"142","27819. How long is it since it was made forest ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",142
"143","—It is a good many years—but not into a forest proper for letting until twelve years ago.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",143
"144","27820. Are there any sheep in the forest now ?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",144

"157","—I cannot tell.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",157
"158","27826. Were there any lands taken from small crofts at the time this forest was made twelve years ago?",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",158
"159","—Not for the forest.",464,"Kenneth Mackenzie, Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",159
