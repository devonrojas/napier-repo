"1","Rev. DONALD M'COLL, Roman Catholic Priest, Iochdar (47)—examined.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",1
"2","12112. The Chairman.—You desire to present a statement on behalf of the crofters whom you represent?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",2
"3","—Yes.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",3
"4","—'Headings of the principal Grievances of the Crofters of this District, to be laid before the Royal Commission in Benecula, on the 29th May 1883. ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",4
"5","1. There is no tenure of land. The crofters hold their lands from term to term. Leases have been hitherto unknown in this country among crofters. We want leases, provided adequate lands are given, sufficient to support a family and pay a fair rent. We ask lands adapted to the means and circumstances of individual families. By leases we could improve the land, and a certain stability given us. ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",5
"6","2. Rack rent, or such high rent on the land, insufficient towards the support of a family, and pay a reasonable rent. There is kelp rent on the land, and kelp manufacturing ceased. Formerly the price of kelp was high, and lands were rented to crofters according to the price of kelp. ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",6
"7","3. The crofters have too little land, and that of inferior quality. The best arable and grazing lands are in the hands of the tacksmen, and at a low rent. Crofters have been sent to inferior lands unsuitable for large farms. This is not a grain-producing country. The return is from three to four at best, while from exhausted and light",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",7
"8","soil corn is raised solely for the purpose of feeding cattle. The crofters depend more on their cattle than on the grain return. This is more a pastoral country. ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",8
"9","4. Spoiliation of common and reclaimed moor. The common was cut up, divided into crofts, and rented to the incoming tenant, and the rent on the original crofts were never lowered ; in other words, the crofters never got compensation for the loss of their lands. The spoliation of the common commenced after 1840, under the factor Clark, carried out with a strong hand by Dr M'Leod and all subsequent factors down to the present day. There were formerly seventy-one crofts in this district, and there are now eighty-eight, exclusive of hill",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",9
"10","pendicles. During the great clearances for sheep walks in 1849 and 1851, many families of the evicted  population were sent to Lochcarnan, forming then our hill grazing ground, and our lands rented to them. There are now over fifty (fifty-six) families in Lochcarnan, Rughasernish, and Ardmore. Some of them pay rent, and some of them are cottars. There are now over seventy cottars in this district. ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",10
"11","5. Overcrowding this district from surplus population and dismissed servants from the large farm. The crofters complain, as they have every reason to complain, of this glaring act of injustice. ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",11
"12","6. Depriving crofters of hill grazing, and giving it to aliens, while the crofters have to pay rent and assessment for the same. At the present day nearly all the hill grazings have been taken from the crofters. The last place for which they pay a rent of £ 20 or upwards is Rughasernish This place was used in summer for grazing and change of water, and in winter for grazing. In 1870 four families were sent to this place from Dremisdale farm, and lands cut out for them at a rent of 25s. for each family. To the full knowledge of the local officials, cottars",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",12
"13","from all quarters settled there within the last six years, and the crofters are deprived of the benefit of the place. The rent is the same as before. This is a serious grievance, and the crofters have a right to complain of it. Change of grass and water is absolutely necessary to the crofters on the sandy soil and west side of the island. Saline and stagnant water detrimental and fatal to cattle. Owing to the unwholesome water, few crofters in the townships of Ardvacher and Killanlay can rear young cattle. Former factors gave sites of houses to individuals, and rented the same without any compensation to the crofter. ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",13
"14","7. No public works towards improving the property or the lands of the crofters. Neglect to repair county road facing the Atlantic, and sluices, in consequence of which the sea encroaches on our lands and grass. This was laid before the former factors, but the road and the sluices remained unrepaired. The want of a public road to Lochcarnan, to meet the steamer, is greatly felt. All our traffic in connection with the steamers is done by sea for want of a road. Besides paying for boating, our goods are often damaged. The distance to Lochcarnan is about three miles. ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",14
"15","8. Frequent changes of factors detrimental to the interest of proprietor and crofters. ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",15
"16","9. Neglect to enter parliamentary voters on the roll. ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",16
"17","10. One of the greatest grievances is the number of cottars from all quarters of the country. They are a heavy burden on the lands of the crofters. Many of these cottars have more cattle and sheep, and are in every way more prosperous, than the crofters paying rent and assessment. ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",17
"18","11. As regards emigration, we may frankly tell our minds to the members of the Royal Commission that we are in no way inclined to emigrate, while there are plenty lands in the country for us, for the next hundred years. Every one is at liberty to remain or emigrate. We desire not to see revived the cruel and forced  evictions, as carried out in 1819 and 1851, when many were bound hand and feet, and packed off like cattle on board the vessel to America. The recollections of ill-treatment and cruel evictions towards many in those",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",18
"19","days operates unfavourably on the minds of the present generation towards emigration. We are more inclined to migrate. We want more lands, for which we are willing to pay a reasonable and fair rent. We want the land valued by impartial judges, knowing the nature and unproductiveness of our soil. We want that equal justice be done to rich and poor, to tacksman and crofter. ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",19
"20","12. Poverty of the crofters. We are yearly getting poorer. We are hemmed in on all sides. Deprived of the common, we are confined to our original crofts, and yearly plough the same exhausted and unproductive ground, in many instances for the last sixty years. Many of us have not got a boll of meal from our own grain this year. The produce of crofts supports ourselves and families only for the half year, and we have to buy meal from Glasgow for the rest of the year. Our dwelling houses are of a very inferior kind, and in many instances cattle in the end of the same. Our part of the country is in a state of transition. Six years ago, a movement was made on the part of the proprietor to have the lands divided into lots. Uncertain of our present tenure, and kept in suspense, we have improved neither houses nor lands. We may be removed to some other part of the country or district. This state of suspense has proved injurious to our general interest. We applied to our proprietrix for redress of our grievances; our petition remained unanswered, and our grievances unredressed. The above dictated by crofters, written and read to them, approved and ordered by them to be signed by the members of the committee appointed. By order, with consent, and concurrence of all the crofters of the district.—RODERICK MACKAY, Ardvachar; FRANCIS MACPHIE, Balgavra.—Iockdar District, May 28, 1883.'",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",20
"21","12113. This memorial has reference to the particular district or township of Iochdar ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",21
"22","—It has reference to the whole district in the north end of South Uist.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",22
"23","12114. How long have you been in that place?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",23
"24","—Since 1862.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",24
"25","12115. So you have had twenty years' experience ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",25
"26","—With the exception of three years at Badenoch.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",26
"27","12116. You can therefore look back to the condition of the country about twenty years ago. Will you state whether you think the condition of the people, having reference to their moral and physical condition, has deteriorated or improved during that time ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",27
"28","—Deteriorated.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",28
"29","12117. In their physical condition ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",29
"30","—Yes.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",30
"31","12118. In what respect is that particularly the case ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",31
"32","—In their worldly means, in their clothes, and in their food.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",32
"33","12119. I saw it stated in an old statistical account of that country in the year 1841, that the people were frequently in a destitute condition with reference to blankets and night clothes. Do you think the people are in that case now ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",33
"34","—I have seen many families without blanket.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",34
"35","12120. What about the clothing of the children?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",35
"36","—Many of them are very badly clad, but the generality of them are pretty fairly clad.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",36
"37","12121. To what do you attribute the deterioration which you believe to exist ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",37
"38","—Want of sheep and the cutting off of the hill grazing.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",38
"39","12122. Do you know of any case of cutting off of the hill grazing since 1862",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",39
"40","—Yes.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",40
"41","12123. Without any compensation to the tenants?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",41
"42","—Yes, within the last six years.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",42
"43","12124. Can you state some instances?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",43
"44","—There was the post, Lauchlan Macdonald, for whom a croft was cut out without any compensation to the crofter, and a lot wa8 cut out for widow Finlay Mackay from the crofters, and they got no compensation, unless they would take part of the macher and part of man's croft.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",44
"45","12125. Were the lands of these people cut out off hill grazing?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",45
"46","—No. These were sent down from Gramisdale farm, from Loch Eynort, or from Tyree, or North Uist, or Benbecula. They came and squatted on the hill grazing that was used for sheilings in summer, and for grazing sheep— about twenty families.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",46
"47","12126. Do they pay any rent?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",47
"48","—No rent.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",48
"49","12127. They just squatted there ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",49
"50","—They just squatted there.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",50
"51","12128. They came there without authority, settled there, and paid no rent. What do you think the factor or administrator of the estate ought to have done ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",51
"52","—The factor should have kept every one in his own place until such times as lands were cut out or compensation given to the tenants for the loss of the grazing ground.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",52
"53","12129. There are a great number of cottars who have settled on various lands, and who occupy them without paying rent. What do you think should now be done with these people?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",53
"54","—If the cottars were lifted off, the crofters would be prosperous enough. As the crofters have borne the burden for a long time, let the large farms have a share of it for a time.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",54
"55","12130. How would you provide them with the means of stocking crofts on those large farms?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",55
"56","—They are better provided, many of them, than crofters who are paying rent.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",56
"57","12131. Have you any statement to make with reference to the schools ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",57
"58","—No. I have been only about one year on the school board and on the parochial board, and I have nothing particular to state, but that I find them in working order. I find the public schools are being taught here according to the Government Education Act.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",58
"59","12132. Who are the members of the school board?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",59
"60","—There are seven members between Benbecula and South Uist,—Mr Mackintosh and I, Dr Black, the parish minister of Uist; Mr John Ferguson, tacksman of Bornish; Mr Charles M'Lean, tacksman of Borv ; and the factor.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",60
"61","12133. Are there any Roman Catholic teachers?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",61
"62","—Not in the whole island.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",62
"63","12134. Have you any other statement you wish to make with reference particularly to your own communion? —None whatever that would tend in any way to improving their condition.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",63
"64","12135. Has the proprietrix contributed in your district to the erection of new houses or to any useful work? —Not a house that I know of, and not a stick to roof a house that I know of, unless a little fence that was put up, and they have to pay so much to the proprietrix for that.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",64
"65","12136. We have had a statement to-day from the factor that the proprietrix has expended more than the whole rental of her estate on the estate during the last five years. Has none of that expenditure reached your district ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",65
"66","—Not a penny.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",66
"67","12137. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—Were you present when Mr Macdonald made that statement?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",67
"68","—Yes. The only public work that is being carried out is erecting a wing to an inn at Carinish.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",68
"69","12138. I understand that the grievance of the people of Iochdar is this, that so many cottar families with a lot of stock are eating up their grazings without paying anything whatever?—That is the case. ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",69
"70","12139. Have you ever applied to them for rent?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",70
"71","—Yes, to the factor. They pay neither poor-rates nor school-rates, and the same cottars again are determined if possible to keep their children from school. They are quite independent. They are sent here the same as penal servitude. That is the great burden and grievance of the tenants.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",71
"72","12140. What is the largest amount of stock any one of these cottars not paying rent possesses ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",72
"73","—I see them with two or three cattle, as many young beasts, and may be twenty, thirty, or forty sheep, and some of them two horses.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",73
"74","12141. The Chairman.—And they pay no rent ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",74
"75","—None.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",75
"76","12142. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—Do they pay nothing in the way of days' labour ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",76
"77","—They neither pay me my fees, nor the factor, nor the schools, nor the parochial board, nor assessments, nor the doctor. ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",77
"78","12143. How many souls, men, women and children, are in this position among the cottars ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",78
"79","—Three years ago there were seventy-one families. The population in my district is about 1000. There are 880 Catholics and hardly 200 Protestants, including crofters and cottars.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",79
"80","12144. But how many men, women, and children, are in the position of not paying rent or doing anything else?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",80
"81","—I should say 250 or 300.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",81
"82","12145. Do the younger members of these families go out to labour and earn wages for themselves?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",82
"83","—They crop our crofts as they please, and graze on our grass, and respect not our crofts. Some of them leave for the militia, and some of them for the Lowlands, and some of them take a trip sailing, and that is the whole.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",83
"84","12146. Is this still going on?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",84
"85","—The number of cottars is increasing yearly from large farms. I have seen one poor woman who was told to",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",85
"86","be out off a place the day after her husband's death, not to be a burden on the tenant.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",86
"87","12147. Should you not have gone with a deputation to see the proprietrix. and make a representation to her to take the matter into consideration?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",87
"88","—It is very difficult to get at her, we so seldom see her in the country.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",88
"89","12148. The Chairman.—Do you think that many of those cottars are the children of crofters in the neighbourhood who have not been provided with land ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",89
"90","—Many of them are not. Some of them are from Tyree and others from Skye, North Uist, and Loch Eynort.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",90
"91","12149. But all those places except the last two are not Gordon places at all?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",91
"92","—No.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",92
"93","12150. Sir Kenneth-Mackenzie.—Did these people receive any authority from anybody to settle where they have settled ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",93
"94","—No.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",94
"95","12151. If they attempted to settle upon a tacksman's land, say upon the farm of Nunton, what would be done? ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",95
"96","—That was in my mind; if twenty cottars were to scatter down on Nunton, with all their cattle and horses, what would he say?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",96
"97","12152. Don't you think the tenant farmer would be the first to take steps to remove them?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",97
"98","—We have abstained from violence or agitation against them.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",98
"99","12153. But it is the tenant's business to remove people who come and settle on their lands in such a way? —But the individuals were ordered down by factors",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",99
"100","12154. I asked if they were ordered, and you said they were there without authority ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",100
"101","—Individuals came, such as from Loch Eynort.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",101
"102","12155. Then I suppose the tenants could prevent these from settling there?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",102
"103","—They could not go against the factor.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",103
"104","12156. So far as the factor has authorised it, you have a ground of complaint, but so far as he has not authorised it, has he not a ground of complaint against the tenants?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",104
"105","—We have spoken often to him on the point, and I have spoken to him personally.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",105
"106","12157. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—Do you know that the proper legal process would be for the tenants to raise a process of removing against the cottars, but they could not do that without the consent of the proprietrix. Would she give her consent ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",106
"107","—Where could she put them ? She would not remove them to large farms.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",107
"108","12158. You think it doubtful whether she would give her consent to the crofters taking out legal process against them ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",108
"109","—Yes, in my opinion it is doubtful .I wish specially to call attention to the parliamentary voters' roll, so that the crofters could have their names entered upon it. ",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",109
"110","12159. The Chairman.—I am afraid we cannot help you with that matter; it is the assessor's duty. Are any of your crofters paying £12?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",110
"111","—Yes; we pay as high as £16.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",111
"112","12160. Mr Cameron.—What rent have you paid?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",112
"113","—£16 in cash.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",113
"114","12161. How long had you paid it before last election ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",114
"115","—I came here in 1867.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",115
"116","12162. Have you always been entered at £16 in the book?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",116
"117","—Yes.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",117
"118","12163. Sheriff Nicolson.—Has the number of crofters increased very much since you came to Iochdar? —Yes, greatly.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",118
"119","12164. Have you any idea how many of them have settled down there since you came ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",119
"120","—About twenty from different quarters.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",120
"121","12165. Have they built houses for themselves ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",121
"122","—Kind of huts, the best way they could.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",122
"123","12166. Do they behave themselves differently from the rest of the population?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",123
"124","—Very questionably.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",124
"125","12167. They seem at any rate to have no great respect for other people's rights or for the law ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",125
"126","—I am the loser by it.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",126
"127","12168. Are many of them members of your congregation?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",127
"128","—Many of them are and many are not.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",128
"129","12169. The Chairman.—Are you personally aware, within the last twenty years, of any cases of hill pasture being taken from a crofter in a township and given to a tacksman?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",129
"130","—Not in this district since the time of Mr Birnie, when he sliced up Ormicleit Hill and Grinnisdale.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",130
"131","12170. But not within the last twenty years?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",131
"132","—Hardly within that time.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",132
"133","12171. Have you been witness of any cases of harsh eviction of crofters from their holdings ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",133
"134","—Net with my own eyes. It has not been carried out since 1849 and 1851.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",134
"135","12172. Is it your opinion that the scale of rental is too high or oppressive upon the people, or is it rather the want of larger crofts ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",135
"136","—It is too high, and the plots are too small. It is exhausted land, that produces nothing but ox-eye or thistles or weeds in general. I desire, however, to make this statement, that Colonel Gordon wished crofters whoever was anxious to pay ready cash down for his lands, to get one-third reduction, but no kelp—no work.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",136
"137","12173. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—The parish minister told us yesterday that on his land he was able to grow very good crops, and he thought by a better system of cultivation the crofters too might grow very good crops. Don't you think that the exhaustion is iu part due to a bad system of cultivation ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",137
"138","—It is not due to bad cultivation, but to the exhausted soil. The minister can allow ground to be there for years and years before he ploughs it, but the crofter must plough it every year.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",138
"139","12174. What success have you achieved for yourself in forming a garden in this part ?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",139
"140","—Well, I manage it better than the crofters, but it is not a paying affair to me, because I work it with servants; but I get better returns by drainage.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",140
"141","12175. Do you get flowers to grow in the place you occupy?",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",141
"142","—Yes.",211,"Rev Donald Mccoll","Benbecula, Torlum",142
