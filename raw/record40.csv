"3","—What is the size of your croft ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",3
"4","—About 7 or 8 acres. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",4
"5","2377. Hill pasture ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",5
"6","—Yes, there is a kind of pasture ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",6
"7","2378. What is the summing of your croft—the stock it is calculated to keep?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",7
"8","—Six cows, one horse, and about twenty sheep. That is the summing for the whole croft. I have a half croft. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",8
"9","2379. You gave us 7 or 8 acres; is that the whole croft, or what you have ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",9
"10","—The whole croft. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",10
"11","2380. Then tell us what you really have yourself ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",11
"12","—Half a croft. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",12
"13","2381. How many cows?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",13
"14","—Two cows. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",14
"15","2382. Do you keep a horse ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",15
"16","—Yes. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",16
"17","2383. How many sheep ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",17
"18","—About seven or eight. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",18
"19","2384. And no young cattle?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",19
"20","—None over a year, and the sheep have gone entirely this year. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",20
"21","2385. What is your rent?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",21
"22","—£7, 10s. for my half croft. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",22
"23","2386. Is that your regular rent, or is it with the reduction which was made two years ago ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",23
"24","—That is the highest rent. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",24
"25","2387. Subtracting the reduction made two years ago, how much do you now pay ? How much did you pay last year?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",25
"26","—There was a permanent abatement of £1 , 2s. 6d. two years ago, and 5s. in the pound beyond that. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",26
"27","2388. Does the £7, 10s. include the permanent reduction, or is the permanent reduction to be taken off that?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",27
"28","—-It is to be taken off that. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",28
"29","2389. That reduces it to £6, 7s. 6d.%",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",29
"30","—Yes. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",30
"31","2390. Then have we to take 5s. in the pound off that again?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",31
"32","—Yes, we got 5 s. in the pound. We pay rates upon the old rent. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",32
"33","2391. How much was the rent you paid for 1882, including rates?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",33
"34","— £5, and -Is. or 5s. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",34
"35","2392. £5, 5s. for two cows, one horse, and seven or eight sheep. Has any hill pasture been taken off the crofters in your memory ? Has the hill pasture been reduced ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",35
"36","—It has. A piece of the pasture was taken from the one end, and that overcrowds the rest of the township. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",36
"37","2393. Was it more than the half of the whole that was taken away?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",37
"38","— No ; the best of it went. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",38
"39","2394. When the hill pasture was taken away, was the rent reduced ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",39
"40","— No, I never heard of the rent being reduced, but always being raised. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",40
"41","2395. But still you said that £1 2s. 6d. was taken off two years ago? ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",41
"42","—That was taken off nowhere; the authorities had gone wrong in the summing. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",42
"43","2396. How much was the rent in your earliest recollection?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",43
"44","—£3, 13s. for the half croft in which I am now. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",44
"45","2397. What year was that?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",45
"46","—Before Captain Fraser became proprietor of the estate.  ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",46
"47","2398. What do the people whom you represent complain of? What is their complaint ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",47
"48","—They have enough to complain of in the high rents that are exacted and the increase of rents. They had quite enough to do as the rents were before that increase. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",48
"49","2399. What do they desire to have ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",49
"50","—-More land, upon which they can make a living without having to go away from the crofts to other places. They cannot remain at home more than a month in spring and a month in harvest, with poverty. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",50
"51","2400. No other complaints ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",51
"52","—About the marches. We do not get justice about the marches. When the sheep are poinded, perhaps they will be two days in a pinfold before we get notice, and still paying ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",52
"53","money for them. A great many of them die with poverty and ""pook"" in the winter, as happened this year. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",53
"54","2401. Were you freely chosen as a delegate by the people without any influence ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",54
"55","—Yes. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",55
"56","2402. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",56
"57","—You said they could not remain at home on account of poverty. You yourself are a salmon fisher ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",57
"58","—Yes, more than twenty years. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",58
"59","2403. You get employment at home ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",59
"60","—For a while of the year. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",60
"61","2404. For how long in the year do you get employment at home ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",61
"62","— About four months. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",62
"63","2405. Which months may those be?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",63
"64","—In the summer, up to the middle of September. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",64
"65","2406. At what time of year do you leave home?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",65
"66","—In the beginning of winter. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",66
"67","2407. Where do you go for employment then ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",67
"68","—To every place where I can best find employment. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",68
"69","2408. Where did you go last year ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",69
"70","—I was not from home last year. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",70
"71","2409. Where were you the year before last ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",71
"72","—About Badenoch. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",72
"73","2410. How long would you be away from home when you were in Badenoch?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",73
"74","—Until it was time for the spring work. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",74
"75","2411. What money would you bring home with you?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",75
"76","—I would not take much money home from any place during the short winter day; but I make a good wage off the fishing. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",76
"77","2412. Have you a family?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",77
"78","—Yes. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",78
"79","2413. You go from home to support yourself?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",79
"80","—I must go from home, as the land won't support us. I did not make a boll of meal for the last eight years on my land. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",80
"81","2414. It is the money you make on the salmon fishing that keeps the family when you are away?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",81
"82","—Yes; and were it not for that, It would have been long since I were in my grave with starvation. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",82
"83","2415. Last year was a worse year than usual, was in not?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",83
"84","—Yes; worse than any that has come yet. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",84
"85","2416. Why did not you go from home last year?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",85
"86","—Because I had a sick family. I lost in one year almost everything I had in the world. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",86
"87","2417. You refer to your stock?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",87
"88","—Yes. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",88
"89","2418. What extent of land and what amount of stock would you think sufficient to keep you for a year here?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",89
"90","—From 15 to 20 acres of arable land. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",90
"91","2419. And what hill stock ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",91
"92","—Ten cows, two horses, and fifty sheep. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",92
"93","2420. Is there land in the country that would give as much as that to every man ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",93
"94","2421. What rent do you think would be a reasonable rent for that extent of land?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",94
"95","—From £10 to £12. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",95
"96","2422. You complain of your marches. Is the march line not a natural division between the croft lands and the big farms ? What sort of a march is it ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",96
"97","—A river in part and a dyke or something. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",97
"98","2423. Is it a march over which sheep would naturally trespass ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",98
"99","—Yes, if they were allowed. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",99
"100","2424. Would it be easy to find a march over which sheep would not be inclined to trespass?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",100
"101","—Yes, if the river were followed. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",101
"102","2425. Would it be increasing your grounds very much to follow the river",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",102
"103","—Yes. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",103
"104","2426. Very much?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",104
"105","—It would give us a good bit more. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",105
"106","2427. Has any attempt been made to fence the marches here 1",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",106
"107","—We could not get a fence with poverty. The proprietors never made any endeavour to put up a fence, and we considered that, as it is the estate march, the proprietors should have a fence there. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",107
"108","2428. Who are the two proprietors there ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",108
"109","—On this side Major Fraser, and Lord Macdonald on the other. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",109
"110","2429. Who is the tacksman on the other side?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",110
"111","—Mr Stewart, Scorrybreck. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",111
"112","2430. Was it he who was poinding the sheep ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",112
"113","—He was doing part of that, and his predecessor was doing the same. We paid in one day about £1 0 to Mr Stewart's predecessor in the farm. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",113
"114","2431. Who was that?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",114
"115","—-Mr William M'Leod. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",115
"116","2432. Did Mr M'Leod complain to them frequently before this of the trespass of the sheep ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",116
"117","—We heard no complaints, but we had a herd, and he had a herd by the marches. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",117
"118","2433. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",118
"119","—You said that a piece of your hill was taken away. To whom was it given ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",119
"120","—It was added to Duntulm. It was Mr Stewart who had the farm then. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",120
"121","2434. You also stated that the best of the hill was taken away, and what was left was not worth much ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",121
"122","—Yes, and if it was good it would have been taken away. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",122
"123","2435. How many crofters are there in Valtos ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",123
"124","—Eleven. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",124
"125","2436. Is that the same number that has been in your recollection, or have they been increased ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",125
"126","—They are not the same. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",126
"127","2437. How many were there in your recollection first? ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",127
"128","— Six families. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",128
"129","2438. Where did the other five come from ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",129
"130","—Some of them from other townships. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",130
"131","2439. Mention what townships ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",131
"132","—One from Loanfearn, another came from Garos, another from Balmeanach. Others belong to the place. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",132
"133","2440. What became of the crofts when the strangers came there ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",133
"134","— The one from Loanfearn was added to the farm of Loanfearn. The one from Garos had no lands there. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",134
"135","2441. What I want to bring out is this, as regards any of the people who came into Valtos from other places, were their crofts added to any of the two large farms ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",135
"136","—The Loanfearn one was added. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",136
"137","2442. What is Loanfearn? is it a part of the big farm, or is it a separate farm ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",137
"138","—A separate farm. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",138
"139","2443. What rent does it pay?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",139
"140","—About £80. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",140
"141","2444. Who had the farm of Loanfearn at the time the crofter's were removed ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",141
"142","—The present tenant, Murdo Nicolson. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",142
"143","2445. Are the people in Valtos, speaking generally, very poor?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",143
"144","—They are poorer than I can tell. It is hardly credible. When they go for a boll of meal from the dealer, the animal the dealer has to get for it must be marked before they can get the meal. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",144
"145","2446. Is it consistent with your knowledge that the people are becoming poorer year by year, and their circumstances becoming worse?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",145
"146","—Yes. It is a poor place that does not give a return. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",146
"147","2447. Do you attribute their poverty to any extent to their being deprived of the hill pasture which has been referred to as being added to?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",147
"148","—They were not the better of it. It did contribute.",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",148
"149","2448. Has the increase of rent you referred to also contributed to their poverty ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",149
"150","—It is the rents that brought us first to poverty. We were in good circumstances until then. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",150
"151","2449. The seasons of late have not been favourable. Is that also an element in their poverty ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",151
"152","—Yes, very heavily. There was one year we lost everything. Everything was blown over into the sea Their crops were delaying the progress of the vessels in the sea. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",152
"153","2450. You are a fisherman. Do you think anything could be done in the locality with which you are immediately connected by putting up quays, where boats could run out in almost all weathers?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",153
"154","—Yes, it would. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",154
"155","2451. Has Valtos a considerable frontage to the sea? Is there any place where such a quay could be erected?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",155
"156","—I do not think there is any place on our shore ; but there is a place down here where it could be done. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",156
"157","2452. Is that at Staffin?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",157
"158","—At Staffin. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",158
"159","2453. Would that be a central place for a considerable number of the crofters who are also fishermen ? Would that be a convenient place fur them to have a quay at?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",159
"160","—It would not be very handy to them, but it would be better than wanting anything of the kind. It would do a great deal of good to us, if steamers were calling. There is nothing of that kind with us. We have not even a road, and we pay road money. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",160
"161","2454. What is the nearest place the public road is to your township of Valtos?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",161
"162","—The road just reaches the march of Valtos. There was a road a number of years back, but it was allowed to go into disuse. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",162
"163","2455. Do you represent, as a delegate here to-day, any other township than Valtos?--No. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",163
"164","2456. Sheriff Nicolson.",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",164
"165","—How often have the rents of Valtos been raised since you have been there?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",165
"166","—Three times. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",166
"167","2457. When was the first rise?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",167
"168","—About twenty-six years ago. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",168
"169","2458. Soon after Captain Fraser came?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",169
"170","—Yes. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",170
"171","2459. Before that was done, were you all made to sign the rules of the estate ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",171
"172","—Yes, but we did not think that that was to come on us. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",172
"173","2460. When you signed the rules you did not expect your rents would be immediately raised ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",173
"174","—No, if we had done so, we would not have signed them. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",174
"175","2461. When was the next rise ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",175
"176","—About ten years ago. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",176
"177","2462. How much was your own rent raised the first time?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",177
"178","—More than £1. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",178
"179","2463. How much was the rise the second time ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",179
"180","—Five shillings for the doctor. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",180
"181","2464. When was the third rise ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",181
"182","—About six years ago. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",182
"183","2465. How much was then put on?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",183
"184","—From £4, 14s. to £7, 10s. altogether. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",184
"185","2466. Were the rents of all the people of Valtos raised in that way?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",185
"186","— All in the same way. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",186
"187","2467. After the last rise, did the people complain to the landlord or the factor about this ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",187
"188","—They went to Uig, and refused to sign for this increase. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",188
"189","2468. What did the factor say?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",189
"190","—The factor asked us to try it for a year. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",190
"191","2469. Then at the end of that year what was done ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",191
"192","—We were paying it for two or three years after that until we found the burden too heavy for us. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",192
"193","2470. Then you refused to pay ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",193
"194","—Yes. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",194
"195","2471. What passed between you and the factor on the subject?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",195
"196","—He threatened to remove us altogether if we did not pay the increase. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",196
"197","2472. What was the end of the matter?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",197
"198","—We got a slight reduction. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",198
"199","2473. How much?-",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",199
"200","—£1, 2s. 6d. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",200
"201","2474. Was that reduction given to all the tenants at Valtos?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",201
"202","— Yes. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",202
"203","2475. Are the assessments for roads and other rates taken off you along with the rent ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",203
"204","—Yes. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",204
"205","2476. Are the assessments laid upon the old rent, or upon the reduced rent ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",205
"206","—On the big rent. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",206
"207","2477. Who gets these assessments ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",207
"208","—I do not know; but we give them to the factor. ",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",208
"209","2478. What has been done in the way of road-making here since Captain Fraser came to the property ?",40,"Norman Stewart","Skye, Stenscholl",209
