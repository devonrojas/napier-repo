"1","HECTOR MACPHERSON, Crofter, Harrapool (55)—examined.",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",1
"2","4554. The Chairman.",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected a delegate?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",3
"4","—Yes. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",4
"5","4555. Have you got a statement to make on the part of those whom Macpherson. you represent ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",5
"6","—Well, I had some delicacy in accepting to be a delegate, because I was afraid I would be hunted afterwards for giving evidence; but I see there is a guarantee from Lord Macdonald and the factor, and I just took courage to come forward. We have general grievances in the township that I belong to. I think it is a great grievance, the small holdings. That is the main grievance, and want of security of tenure, and want of compensation in case of removals. The rents are high, but are considered high owing to the smallness of the holdings. These are the main points, I think. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",6
"7","4556. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",7
"8","—Have you anything else to state in addition ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",8
"9","—There are grievances connected with cottars being rented who are on the crofts of other parties, and no reduction of rent. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",9
"10","4557. Does that occur in your own township ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",10
"11","—It does. It is not on my croft, but it is in the township. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",11
"12","4558. Does the proprietor get that rent ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",12
"13","—Well, it is likely. It was Tormore who imposed the rents on the cottars here on the lands of the crofters. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",13
"14","4559. And you got no allowance?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",14
"15","—No, there was no allowance. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",15
"16","4560. Did you use to charge any rents to these cottars'?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",16
"17","—Not that I know of. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",17
"18","4561. Is there any other grievance ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",18
"19","—The money we got for improving was added to the rents at the expiry of the time that we were allowed to pay the interest for it. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",19
"20","4562. You mean drainage money ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",20
"21","—Yes. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",21
"22","4563. Is it still going on?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",22
"23","—-It is still going on, added to the rents, and we are assessed for it in connection with the rent. It stands as rent now. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",23
"24","4564. How many years is it since you got the money?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",24
"25","—I think thirty-two years or so. There were twenty years allowed to pay it. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",25
"26","4565. Anything else?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",26
"27","—We are paying for sea-ware. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",27
"28","4566. To whom?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",28
"29","—To the proprietor, or to the adjoining tenant who can sell some. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",29
"30","4567. Have you none of your own?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",30
"31","—Well, we have a little, but it is not sufficient. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",31
"32","4568. What are you charged for what you require to buy?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",32
"33","—Those who have a little of their own will do with 5s. worth yearly. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",33
"34","4569. Is that about the highest""?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",34
"35","—No, it is not about the highest. Those who require it require the value of about 10s. or 12s. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",35
"36","4570. Is there not enough sea-ware on the shores of Skye far all without any payment ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",36
"37","—I think there is no scarcity here, but only they have to pay for it. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",37
"38","4571. Have you any other grievance?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",38
"39","—There are game and rabbits in our grazing. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",39
"40","4572. We have heard to-day of rabbits for the first time. Are the rabbits very troublesome ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",40
"41","—They are. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",41
"42","4573. Are they growing; are they increasing?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",42
"43","—They are always increasing, except when the sportsmen are after them. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",43
"44","4574. Are you not aware you can protect yourself now to some extent ? ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",44
"45","—No, because we are tenants at will. We cannot protect ourselves. There is no fixity of tenure. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",45
"46","4575. Don't you even try to trap them?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",46
"47","—No, we don't even dare to trap them. If we did we might be put in jail",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",47
"48","—if there was room for us. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",48
"49","4576. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",49
"50","—You said there was no security of tenure. Has anybody been removed from Harrapool or the neighbouring townships of late years ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",50
"51","—I don't know of any of late, but that is the Macpherson good-will of the proprietor and the factor. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",51
"52","4577. How long is it since you heard of a removal ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",52
"53","—Well, removal was carried on in my time on a very extensive scale. Perhaps it is too far back to speak of, but in this parish there were a few cases of those who were thrown out and evicted. I think there is a woman outside at the door who can give evidence of that. She was a widow woman with two children, and she was thrown out of her holding without any rent or arrears. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",53
"54","4578. What was the reason she was thrown out?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",54
"55","—She was at Breakish. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",55
"56","4579. For what reason ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",56
"57","—There was no reason. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",57
"58","4580. Is she a very poor woman now?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",58
"59","—Yes, she is supported by her son now. She has two sons, and one is in the army, and the other has to support his mother. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",59
"60","4581. How long is it since she was turned out?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",60
"61","—Upwards of ten years ago. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",61
"62","4582. Was it for doing something against the will of the proprietor or factor that she was removed ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",62
"63","—I do not think it. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",63
"64","4583. You say the rent of the crofts is thought high because they are small ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",64
"65","—Yes; supposing I had the croft I had myself gratis from the proprietor, I would prefer to have three times as much and pay for it, becauee I could bring a living out of it. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",65
"66","4584. Is there ground near you held by tacksmen that could be used for enlarging your holding?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",66
"67","—Well, there is plenty of ground in the parish, only it is occupied by the tacksmen. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",67
"68","4585. Supposing the crofters got it, would they be able to pay as good a rent as the tacksman is able to pay ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",68
"69","—It could not be expected that crofters would pay for tacks that were in the market for some time back, and parties declaring they were ruined by these tacks. They would pay a reasonable rent imposed by a valuator. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",69
"70","4586. They would not pay as high a rent as the tacksman would be able to pay ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",70
"71","—It seems the tacksmen are not able to pay when they are willing to get clear of their tacks. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",71
"72","4587. Suppose it is let again, and the proprietors have to take a reduced rent from tacksmen, will you be able to compete with the tacksmen ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",72
"73","—Of course, not without capital. The tacksmen are men of capital. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",73
"74","4588. How can you expect to take any large holding without capital ? ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",74
"75","—It would be easier to have large holdings than to be paying it to the merchants here and there. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",75
"76","4589. But you want to stock it ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",76
"77","—Well I would strive to stock it too. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",77
"78","4590. Would you get money to stock it?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",78
"79","—I think the factor would advance the money on good security. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",79
"80","4591. The Chairman.",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",80
"81","—You said there was a woman who had been turned out of her holding, and that she is here at the present moment. Did she ask you to mention her case to us ?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",81
"82","—-Yes. ",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",82
"83","4592. Does she wish to be examined?",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",83
"84","—Yes, she came to my house this morning.",80,"Hector Macpherson","Skye, Broadford",84
