"1","JOHN WALKER, Crofter, North Boisdale (83)—examined.",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",1
"2","11174. The Chairman. Were you freely elected a delegate?",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",2
"3","—Yes. ",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",3
"4","11175. You produce a written statement?",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",4
"5","—Yes. We had a great reason to complain. About forty years ago there were twenty-four crofters in this village, and now it is situated on forty-eight, with heavy families. In the month of September the most of our crop will be destroyed with heavy floods, owing to the leading drains being closed up more than twenty years ago. Also the west side, that we called the Macher, are exhausted, and going with the wind, which cannot be",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",5
"6","made up without the help of the landlord. The hill pasture that we had for grazing our cattle, horses, and sheep, if we would have any, are now situated on six or seven tenants. And when we will go out to our grazing place, they are drilling them back with their dogs. The property that we have does not belong to ourselves; it belongs to the men who supply us with food and clothing; and the reason that we are in the",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",6
"7","heavy debts is this, that our land is exhausted with the number of the people. And about forty-six years ago we used to sell plenty of graiu and potatoes, besides keeping up our own families, and the place where that",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",7
"8","was growing is now filled up with Cheviot and oxen. We are now kept so far behind that we will no get leave to keep the littlest dog about our houses. Then we are paying so much taxes for poor-rates, school, and",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",8
"9","road taxes, and we never get an account of what they were doing with it, and therefore the new alteration that they are expecting to do on this village, instead of improving us, would make us worse than ever. When the kelp was at a high price, this land was rented according to that, and since a couple of years ago the kelp stopped, and the rent is as high as ever. About thirty years ago the late Colonel Gordon offered the third part of the rent down to them that would pay ready cash for it, and the rest never got the same chance again. We are in great need of help, and wishing to get more land for the future.",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",9
"10","11176. Mr Cameron.—How many crofters are there in this township now ?",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",10

"32","11187. Do you in any way complain of these cottars being amongst you?",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",32
"33","—We are complaining of their presence there, because our cattle when they are sent out are chased by dogs, and sent back again by those squatters.",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",33

"51","—I have one calf.",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",51
"52","11197. Is that about the stock which your neighbours keep?",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",52
"53","—No.",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",53
"54","11198. What do they keep?",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",54

"58","11200. Is that why you keep so little stock?",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",58
"59","—Want of money is the cause. My children married and left me, and there is only my wife and myself.",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",59
"60","11201. What hill pasture have you in common ?",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",60

"66","11204. What is the summing of the croft",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",66
"67","—Six cows, two horses, and a young horse.",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",67
"68","11205. Are you quite sure the summing is only six cows?",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",68

"79","—They didn't leave the country. Some of them married in my own neighbourhood.",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",79
"80","11211. Do you get any help from them?",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",80
"81","—No, I have never troubled any of them very much yet.",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",81
"82","11212. I understand that all you complain of as representing North Boisdale is that the cottars trouble you? —That is their chief complaint.",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",82
"83","11213. Have you any other?",192,"John Walker","South Uist, Lochboisdale",83
