"1","BENJAMIN SWANSON, Factor for Dr Traill, North Ronaldshay, and Ground Officer, Sanday (37). —examined.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",1
"2","25184. The Chairman.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",2
"3","— Do you come here spontaneously to make a statement, or are you a delegate ?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",3
"4","—I am not a delegate. I come here in consequence of some statements made in Sanday by Mr Muir in connection with the property with which I am connected. The statement I would like to make with regard to that, is that Mr Muir was not appointed a delegate, for the North Ronaldshay men never asked him to speak for them. It was spontaneous evidence on his part; and besides he knows nothing about the island and his evidence is worth nothing. I do not believe he ever had his foot upon it. He made some statements about Dr Traill's management. He said that but for the tyranny of the proprietor he believed the people would have been across from North Ronaldshay. Now that is very far from being true. It is well known Dr Traill is a lenient proprietor, the people have made no complaint to Dr Traill or me, and I believe they are living as happily as any people in Orkney or out of it, Mr Muir made a statement about Dr Traill preventing the people starting fishcuring. Now the two lads who tried to start the business had no means of their own, and it is quite true that they did bring a boat's cargo of salt, perhaps six or seven tons; but they did so without asking Dr Traill any liberty for the use of the store or use of the ground to dry fish. Dr Traill did not prevent them; he actually give them the use of the store, but said he did not think it would be a benefit for them or the people to start the business. He asked them a day or two after what they were to do and they said—Well, Sir, we have given up the idea.' ' We do not think it will do us any good;' and they sold the salt in North Ronaldshay. Mr Muir said they sold part of it in Kirkwall, but that is not true, they sold it all on the spot.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",4
"5","25185. Was it bought by a fishcurer in the island?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",5
"6","—There is no fishcurer in the island. The people cure their own fish and get a larger price than they would get if there was a curer there. They would only get the price of green fish from a curer, whereas they get the full maker's value as it is.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",6
"7","25186. I understood you to say that these lads did not ask Dr Traill for leave to use the shore; I thought it was in the power of everybody engaged in fishing to use the shore?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",7
"8","—It is the store. Neither did they make any provision for making a curing station on the island. They did not ask anything about that,",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",8
"9","25187. I understood you also to say they had not asked for leave for the use of the shore for drying the fish?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",9
"10","—Well, of course the fish must be dried above high water mark, and they did not ask liberty to dry",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",10
"11","them there. ",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",11
"12","25188. I thought the law allowed fishermen to do that?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",12
"13","—I do not think so; they must pay rent for it I should think.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",13
"14","25189. But if the shore is not enclosed and cultivated, have not fishermen under an Act of Parliament got a right to dry their fish on the shore?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",14
"15","—I do not think so; I am not aware of it. I do not think they have any right to erect a fishcuring station without asking the liberty of the proprietor and paying rent for it.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",15
"16","25190. The procurator fiscal says the fishermen have the right to do it, but not the fishcurers ?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",16
"17","—Possibly that is it.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",17
"18","25191. But these men might have been fishermen as well as fishcurers?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",18
"19","—They were not fishermen, and Dr Traill told them he did not believe it would do themselves or the people good. He was just afraid they would very likely put up a store along with it—a grocery place—to supply the fishermen. He was afraid the people would not be well served, because the men who proposed to start the thing had no means, and he was afraid the thing might partake a good deal of the truck system if it went on. ",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",19
"20","25192. Dr Traill wishes everybody to be free to catch and dry fish and not fall into the power of the curers?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",20
"21","—That was his wish particularly. He spoke to me afterwards and asked if I thought it would be a",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",21
"22","good thing to start a fishing station in North Ronaldshay, and I said it might, but only if a good man could be got But the people have no disadvantage by curing their own fish, but rather an advantage, because they get the prices of dry marketable fish, whereas in selling to the curers, they would only get the price of green fish.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",22
"23","25193. Is there a shopkeeper in the island who is able to sell them all they want?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",23
"24","—Yes, and besides they go to Kirkwall regularly in the summer time, and they have communication with Sanday once a week and want for nothing in that way. I saw some of them on Saturday myself and they were astonished at Muir's statement. I believe he tried to create an agitation and get some to come over, and they were astonished that he should talk of Dr Traill being tyrannical, because they said he was always very kind to them. Dr Traill goes about amongst them regularly when lie is in the island. It was the statement about Dr Traill particularly that I wished to contradict, because I know it will hurt the people's feelings.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",24
"25","25194. Mr Cameron.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",25
"26","—Have you any other statement you wish to make about the estate?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",26
"27","—I do not think so.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",27
"28","25195. Is the land occupied by large farmers or small farmers?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",28
"29","—By small farmers except some land the proprietor holds in his own hands.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",29
"30","25196. Within what range do rents extend?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",30
"31","—£2 to £39, 10s., none above that.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",31
"32","25197. Have we had any other witnesses or delegates from North Ronaldshay before us?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",32
"33","—None.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",33
"34","25198. Have these tenants got all their land enclosed within fences, or have they any hill pasture or common grazing? ",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",34
"35","—They have some common grazing which is enclosed, but their lands otherwise are pretty open; in fact there is rather too much enclosed. There are some patches which would have been better left open.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",35
"36","25199. Is there none of their land taken away to create sheep farms?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",36
"37","—None. There has not been any change on the estate for a long time.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",37
"38","25200. Are there any other proprietors in North Ronaldshay besides Dr Traill?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",38
"39","—None.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",39
"40","25201. Are the rates and taxes as high as in some other parts of Orkney ?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",40
"41","—We have no road tax. The other taxes are the same as in Cross and Burness, Sanday. The poor rate and school rate amount to about Is. 2d. The tenants' share of the poor rate is about 7½ d. and of the school rate about 6½d. These are all the local taxes the tenants pay. Mr Muir also mentioned about the houses being bad. They do not look very well on the outside, but they are very comfortable inside.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",41
"42","25202. Who is Mr Muir?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",42
"43","—He is a merchant in Sanday who knows nothing, I believe, about North Ronaldshay. He never was in the island to my knowledge.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",43
"44","25203. Has he any dealings with the people specially?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",44
"45","—He does deal with the people; in fact he is doing more harm there than any person I know. He sends goods across there, and employs a man who travels over the island selling them.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",45
"46","25204. How does he do harm by that?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",46
"47","—He must have that profit and the man must have his, and before the goods get to the people they will likely have to pay more for them than if they were to go and buy elsewhere. Besides he is bringing the goods to the people's door, and encouraging them to buy things they could do very well without. ",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",47
"48","25205. You think he was not only not appointed delegate, but that he has never been in the island?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",48
"49","—I don't believe he ever was in the island. He made a statement which was very unwarrantable, and he had no knowledge of the place.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",49
"50","25206. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",50
"51","—Were you present at Sanday the other day?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",51
"52","—Yes.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",52
"53","25207. Did you hear Mr Muir make this statement?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",53
"54","—Yes.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",54
"55","25208. Why did you not contradict him?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",55
"56","—1 had no opportunity.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",56
"57","25209. You are a volunteer here?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",57
"58","—Yes; I spoke on Friday to be allowed to come here to-day.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",58
"59","25210. Why did you not on that day ask to be allowed to contradict the statement?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",59
"60","—I asked to be allowed, but I wanted simply to suit the Commissioners' convenience.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",60
"61","25211. The Chairman.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",61
"62","—Mr Swanson did offer; I remember quite well.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",62
"63","25212. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",63
"64","—You were quite prepared to contradict everything which was said?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",64
"65","—Yes.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",65
"66","25213. Were you prepared to make the same charges in Mr Muir's presence as you have done in his absence?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",66
"67","—Yes, only I went to North Ronaldshay on Saturday, and I am in a better position to-day to speak on",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",67
"68","some points than I was then.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",68
"69","25214. Where do you live?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",69
"70","—Sanday.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",70
"71","25215. How often do you go to North Ronaldshay?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",71
"72","—In the summer time perhaps once a month. In winter I am not so often there.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",72
"73","25216. You do not think it would be an advantage to the island or to the people to develop its industries by having a curing establishment?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",73
"74","—If we could get a good man; it would depend upon that; Dr Traill has no objections if he got a curer who was a good man. By a good man I mean a judicious man, a man of means who could carry it on and pay the people ready money for their fish. The people who attempted to start business had no means and they told me on Saturday that they were very glad now that Dr Traill spoke to them. Dr Traill did not prevent them doing it, but they were glad that they had not carried it on.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",74
"75","25217. Don't you think they must have thought seriously about the matter when they brought salt all the way from Kirkwall?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",75
"76","—They knew the expense was very little, and I have no doubt they made a profit off the salt. The salt was required in the island and they would make the freight out of it. Besides it could not have been more than six or seven tons which they brought.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",76
"77","25218. Are merchants prevented from opening places of business in the island?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",77
"78","—No there are plenty of merchants in this island; too many for their own good.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",78
"79","25219. You said you saw some of the people of North Ronaldshay?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",79
"80","—I did.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",80
"81","25220. Would it not have been more satisfactory if you had brought some of them here to-day?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",81
"82","—It might, but I did not ask them. If they had any grievance they would have spoken to me about it previous to now, or they might have spoken to Dr TrailL",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",82
"83","25221. Have you been long a factor?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",83
"84","—Since 1876.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",84
"85","25222. I suppose you know the island and all its capacities and capabilities?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",85
"86","—Yes.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",86
"87","25223. You are perfectly satisfied with the state of it?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",87
"88","—Yes, but I would like if it were improved.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",88
"89","25224. What is wrong with it?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",89
"90","—There are a good many things we would like. I would like to see the people all work better; but they devote part of their time to farming, and part to fishing, and do not work both to advantage. ",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",90
"91","25225. The real state of matters is that the landlord has a grievance rather than the people?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",91
"92","—Yes, he is not coming forward with grievances, but he has more occasion to give evidence in that way than the people. The people seem to be very happy indeed, if they were let alone.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",92
"93","25226. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",93
"94","—It was stated that the people in North Ronaldshay had elected the Free Church minister as delegate, but he had gone abroad, and he asked Mr Muir to represent him?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",94
"95","—Yes.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",95
"96","25227. Mr Muir said Mr Grant promised to send a written statement, which he did not do.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",96
"97","—I do not believe Mr Grant asked Mr Muir. Mr Muir said he was not asked to represent the people, but that Mr Grant said he was to send a written statement which he, Muir, had not got.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",97
"98","25228. Was there a meeting in North Ronaldshay appointing Mr Grant?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",98
"99","—No. There was a meeting in Sanday, at which Mr Grant was appointed a delegate, but I never heard that he had accepted the office. I never heard anything more about it until Friday last before the Commissioners in Sanday.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",99
"100","25229. Were the people of North Ronaldshay at that meeting?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",100
"101","—None of them.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",101
"102","25230. So Mr Grant had no commission any more than Mr Muir?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",102
"103","—No, it was at a meeting of crofters in Sanday, that he was proposed as a delegate.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",103
"104","25231. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",104
"105","—Of what place is Mr Grant minister?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",105
"106","—He was then minister of North Ronaldshay, but he has now gone to Australia.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",106
"107","25232. Has he left for good ?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",107
"108","—Yes.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",108
"109","25233. The Chairman.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",109
"110","—You said it was the landlord rather than the tenants who had cause of complaint in North Ronaldshay, can you tell me when the rental of North Ronaldshay was increased?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",110
"111","—Not in my time, nor yet for a good while before, I think.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",111
"112","25234. Taking a period of thirty years?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",112
"113","—Well, I am not aware that it has been raised in that time.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",113
"114","25235. Have you any large farms upon the island at all?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",114
"115","—There have been none since I remember.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",115
"116","25236. It remains in its old condition?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",116
"117","—It remains in the condition in which it was a long time ago.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",117
"118","25237. Have you seen the old rental books and accounts of the property?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",118
"119","—No.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",119
"120","25238. But you have heard people speak about the matter; have you ever heard any tradition of rents having been increased?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",120
"121","—No, I am not aware of it. Very likely they have been increased, but it must have been a long time ago. I suppose they have increased there as well as elsewhere, but it is a great number of years since there was any rise.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",121
"122","25239. Is it the custom to give any waste land on improving leases to the tenants?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",122
"123","—The tenants in North Ronaldshay do not want leases. They have so much faith in the proprietor, that they do not want leases. He is quite willing to give them leases if they want them.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",123
"124","25240. Do they ever build houses themselves?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",124
"125","—It is a long time since they built houses, but they keep them in repair.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",125
"126","25241. Does the proprietor ever rebuild houses?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",126
"127","—He gives assistance occasionally.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",127
"128","25242. What are the houses like? Have they the fires on the floor?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",128
"129","—No they have chimneys; if they only had slate roofs they would look very respectable indeed.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",129
"130","25243. Have they two rooms now, generally?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",130
"131","—All of them, and some more. They have wooden partitions, and some have wooden floors and a coomceiled place above. They look better inside than out.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",131
"132","25244. Are the small holdings subdivided, or do the young people go away to other places?",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",132
"133","—The young people stop too much on the land, but we prevent subdividing as much as possible. It is not allowed, but they sometimes stay against the proprietor's wish. If Dr Traill was a tyrant they would not be allowed to stay, but they depend a good deal on the fishing—some of the smaller holdings —and on the kelp-working.",422,"Benjamin Swanson","Orkney, Kirkwall",133
