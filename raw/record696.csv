"168","â€”No.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",168
"169","42491. In the very large sum given for drainage have you any idea of the amount expended upon the big and small holdings relatively?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",169
"170","â€”No. It was done before my time, and I cannot speak of that. I think the most of it is on the crofters' ground. What has been done this summer has been entirely on the crofters' ground.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",170
"171","42492. Of course, the large sum upon piers and hotels is more of a general kind?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",171
"172","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",172
"173","42493. Now, seven families, you say, emigrated last year upon what would appear to be very liberal terms on the part of the proprietrix; are the same prospects held out to those who have applied for going away this year?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",173
"174","â€”No, it could scarcely be expected that the same prospect could be offered by any proprietor to a number of people. I have no doubt, some assistance will be given.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",174
"175","42494. I understand Lady Gordon Cat-heart's agent and commissioner are just now over in Canada seeing about the people?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",175
"176","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",176
"177","42495. And there has been a very encouraging letter from the people?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",177
"178","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",178
"179","42496. Have they come under any obligation to repay any of that money given to them?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",179
"180","â€”Yes, I believe they have.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",180
"181","42497. When they can conveniently do so?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",181
"182","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",182
"183","42498. Their effects were taken over by Lady Gordon Cathcart, but fortunately that has been realised by the incoming tenant?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",183
"184","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",184
"185","42499. Who got the land they left?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",185
"186","â€”It was given to the neighbouring crofters.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",186
"187","42500. There were no new holdings made?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",187
"188","â€”No.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",188
"189","42501. And I suppose that is the policy meant to be carried out in so far as it can be carried out?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",189
"190","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",190
"191","42502. But the crofts are admittedly too small?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",191
"192","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",192
"193","42503. In addition to enlarging the holdings in that way, are you aware whether there is any actual enlargement of them by taking from the surface of the large farms, or whether there is any intention to do so?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",193
"194","â€”I am not aware there is any intention to do so.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",194
"195","42504. But as opportunities offer, to consolidate the smaller crofts?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",195
"196","â€”Precisely.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",196
"197","42505. At the present moment, upon these estates, as upon most we have visited, there is a very great and wide gulf between the small tenant and the large farmer?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",197
"198","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",198
"199","42506. And so far as you know the policy on this estate is to endeavour to bridge over that gulf?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",199
"200","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",200
"201","42507. Not by enlarging the crofting area, but by consolidating it?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",201
"202","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",202
"203","42508. Will you give an opinion of your own upon that point?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",203
"204","â€”In my opinion that is their only salvation.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",204
"205","42509. Are you prepared to give an opinion whether it would be a wise policy, in addition to any consolidation you can make by removal of the people, that there should also be some increase of the area of these comparatively small holdings?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",205
"206","â€”Well, there are so many people that really it is only putting off the evil day; and so far as my experience goes there is no salvation for these people except by emigration.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",206
"207","42510. Admitting there are upon the estates a greater number of people than could be maintained there permanently in comfort, do you think some of those large farms in the hands of those people, instead of having an average rent of Â£300 or Â£400, might with advantage be broken up into holdings of Â£50 and Â£100?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",207
"208","â€”That might be done, if there were a chance of doing it.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",208
"209","42511. As a matter of wise policy?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",209
"210","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",210
"211","42512. Do you think from your knowledge of the means of the people, that there are many or even a few of them who would be able to take such a holding, supposing they got it?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",211
"212","â€”There may be a few, but very few, I believe.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",212
"213","42513. Of course, there could be only a few such holdings?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",213
"214","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",214
"215","42514. So that if there were such holdings on the property it is possible you might get tenants on the property for them?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",215
"216","â€”You might get a few of them.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",216
"217","42515. And you also admit that if it were practicable that would be a very desirable class of holdings to have?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",217
"218","â€”No doubt.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",218
"219","42516. About this reclaimed ground, which was done at very large expense, is it still in the hands of the proprietrix?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",219
"220","â€”Yes, at present.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",220
"221","42517. Do you know anything about the ultimate intention with regard to it?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",221
"222","â€”It is intended to be given out as lots to crofters.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",222
"223","42518. What size of lots?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",223
"224","â€”Perhaps from six to fifteen acres.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",224
"225","42519. So far as you have been able to form a general idea of the place since you went there, what minimum rent of a croft, as crofts go in that place, do you think would maintain a family in comparative comfort, with hard work and industry?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",225
"226","â€”From Â£10 to Â£ 30 crofts, I would say.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",226
"227","42520. You would not like to put a crofter upon a holding of less than Â£10 in that place, where I suppose the rents are not very high?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",227
"228","â€”No.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",228
"229","42521. Do you think that a holding of Â£10, as rents go on the property, could maintain a family that would work and be industrious?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",229
"230","â€”It could scarcely maintain them without fishing.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",230
"231","42522. But with the adjunct of fishing it would?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",231
"232","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",232
"233","42523. And it is crofts from that size up to Â£ 30 or so, that you are endeavouring to establish?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",233
"234","â€”Yes. I may mention that I think, if some people were leaving these islands, a Free Church minister or priest should go along with them. That would encourage some of them to leave,â€”if they got a clergyman of their own denomination. I know that from a number of the people.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",234
"235","42524. You think they would be more easily induced to go, if the clergymen would go along with them?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",235
"236","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",236
"237","42525. Do you find that, even oh the favourable terms that have been offered, there is a reluctance to go?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",237
"238","â€”Well, some of them are willing to go, but others appear to have a reluctance to go.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",238
"239","42526. So far as you are aware, the policy of the proprietrix just now to improve the condition of the people who remain on the estate is mainly to be carried out by the emigration of some?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",239
"240","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",240
"241","42527. And not by the enlargement of the area of small holdings upon the estate,?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",241
"242","â€”Quite so.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",242
"243","42528. The Chairman.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",243
"244","â€”You said that this ground which Lady Gordon Cathcart has taken in herself was to be appropriated to small holdings?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",244
"245","â€”Yes, by and by.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",245
"246","42529. Was that ground taken out of the common pasture or out of the arable?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",246
"247","â€”Entirely out of the common pasture, except two fields which were taken out of some crofts.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",247
"248","42530. I observe, in one of the letters from people who have gone abroad, the writer said that the thing they missed most in their new settlement in Manitoba was the want of a clergyman and a church?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",248
"249","â€”I believe that.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",249
"250","42531. Is there any intention, do you know, on the part of the Free Church to send out a missionary?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",250
"251","â€”I have not heard anything of that, but I think they should do it.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",251
"252","42532. You think that would be an encouragement to the people to go?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",252
"253","â€”I am sure of it.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",253
"254","42.533. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",254
"255","â€”You have not been very long in South Uist?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",255
"256","â€”Not very long. ",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",256
"257","42534. How long is it since you went?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",257
"258","â€”About seven months. ",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",258
"259","42535. You were formerly under-factor for Baillie of Dochfour, at Kingussie?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",259
"260","â€”Yes. ",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",260
"261","42536. You were there during our late visit to South Uist?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",261
"262","â€”Yes. ",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",262
"263","42537. And, if I mistake not, Mr Macdonald, the principal commissioner spoke at considerable length at each of the three places we visited?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",263
"264","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",264
"265","42538. Do you recollect I asked him, in consequence of the time he occupied, rather to the disadvantage of the local people, to come to Inverness, where I might cross-examine him?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",265
"266","â€”I did not take notice of that.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",266
"267","42539. But he is not here?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",267
"268","â€”He is not home from America yet.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",268
"269","42540. In point of fact, he was not cross-examined?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",269
"270","â€”I think he will be at the Edinburgh meeting.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",270
"271","42541. With regard to the money that was laid out on the improvements in South Uist, was it all given to people belonging to the estate?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",271
"272","â€”Most of it was.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",272
"273","42542. Were there not a good number of people imported from a distance?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",273
"274","â€”There was a contractor imported who gave work to the local people in budding hotels.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",274
"275","42543. Were tradesmen brought from the east coast to build, while native masons and joiners got no work given to them?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",275
"276","â€”Not since I went thereâ€”not to my knowledge. They were all local tradesmen that were employed.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",276
"277","42544. Could this have occurred before you went?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",277
"278","â€”It might have occurred; I cannot speak to that.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",278
"279","42545. Although those improvements were intended for the benefit of the estate?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",279
"280","â€”Surely.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",280
"281","42546. Can you answer this question, whether the wages, or some of the wages that were given to the people at those improvements were kept back for the purpose of paying off their arrears, or whether they were paid down their full money week by week?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",281
"282","â€”Some of it may have been kept off for rent; but I think most of the arrears are standing still all over the property.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",282
"283","42547. Do you recollect that Mr Macdonald made a public statement that anything which was stated before the Commissioners would not prejudice directly or indirectly the delegate giving evidence?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",283
"284","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",284
"285","42548. Are you aware that that has been acted upon?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",285
"286","â€”Yes, I am aware it has been acted upon.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",286
"287","42549. Are you aware of cases or a case where a person has lost the favour of the proprietrix in consequence of giving evidence?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",287
"288","â€”No, I am not aware of it.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",288
"289","42550. Do you believe there is such a case?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",289
"290","â€”I don't believe there is such a thing.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",290
"291","42551. You never heard it before?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",291
"292","â€”I never heard there was anything of the kind, because since I went there we have never changed anything. Everything has gone on the same as before.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",292
"293","42552. The proprietrix has been in the habit of coming for the last few years to visit the estate?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",293
"294","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",294
"295","42553. Supposing, then, in previous years she was in the habit of showing some attention or kindness to a person, and that person gave evidence to us, and this year the favour of the proprietrix has been",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",295
"296","entirely withdrawn from that individual; are you aware of such a case?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",296
"297","â€”Well, there was nothing done in that way. We got a staff of gamekeepers into the island, and the fishing has been stopped from everybody except those who get permission. Now, that was not done for any reason whatever. It was done because we got a new staff of keepers and everybody fished and a good deal of poaching went on, and for that reason the fishing was stopped from all and sundry. Some may think it was done for a purpose, but I am bound to say it was not.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",297
"298","42554. You are a Highlander yourself?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",298
"299","â€”Yes, I am.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",299
"300","42555. And have every good feeling towards your fellow countrymen?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",300
"301","â€”Yes, my sympathies are very much with the crofters.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",301
"302","42556. What do you think of the people now that you are among them?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",302
"303","â€”I think that if they were let alone they are a decent enough class of people, and I would not be afraid of keeping.the South Uist people if they were left alone.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",303
"304","42557. You recollect the Roman Catholic priest, Mr M'Call, making a complaint at Iochdar of the number of squatters upon the crofts?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",304
"305","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",305
"306","42558. Have you taken any steps in regard to that?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",306
"307","â€”Yes.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",307
"308","42559. What do you propose to do to relieve the crofters of that great burden?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",308
"309","â€”That is the difficulty, because these squatters are sons-in-law and brothers, and so on. They went there with the consent of the tenants. They are all related together, and what to do with them is the question. I don't know what to do with them unless some of them emigrate.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",309
"310","42560. You stated the proprietrix is disposed to encourage emigration; if the people should emigrate at all would it not be better to emigrate some of these squatters than to put decent crofters away?",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",310
"311","â€”Well, we are trying to do that.",696,"Angus Maclennan","Inverness, ",311
