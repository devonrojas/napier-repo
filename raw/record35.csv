"2","2139. The Chairman.",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",2
"3","—How long have you been a crofter at Solitote?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",3
"4","—It is two years since I got my present croft. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",4
"5","2140. Where did you live before?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",5
"6","—In the neighbouring township",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",6
"7","—Balmaquien. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",7
"8","2141. Why did you leave that township ?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",8
"9","—I married and left.",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",9
"10","2142. Does the croft belong to yourself, or are you in the house of your mother-in-law ?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",10
"11","—I am in my own house and lands. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",11
"12","2143. You have a paper with which you have been entrusted by the people of Solitote?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",12

"14","GENTLEMEN, —We, the crofters resident in Solitote, Kilmaluag, beg to lay some grievances which we labour under before you for consideration. A piece of land, formerly in the hands of one crofter, is now divided among eighteen, fourteen of whom pay rent. Our crofts are miserably small, and by being taken in year after year the land is of very bad quality. The rent of the land when under one crofter  was £9, 8s., and we now pay in all £22,10s., although the third part of the croft is in the hands of another tenant. We are not allowed to keep even a cow or sheep ; have no privilege to cut heather for binding the roofs of our houses, or rushes to thatch them with; and we are even debarred from  cutting sea-ware to manure our ground. We used to have part of the hill adjoining our township, but this was taken from us, and we really have nothing now. We would desire land sufficient to allow us to keep a cow  or two, and also to have the privilege of keeping a few sheep—the land to be reasonable in price. We would also desire the right to cut sea-ware for manuring our crofts. You will confer a great blessing on us by considering our case, and your efforts on our behalf will be gratefully acknowledged by your humble servants,",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",14

"16","2144. How do the people whom you represent subsist, since they have no cow, no sheep, and no land ?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",16
"17","—Off the sea for the most part. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",17
"18","2145. What is their principal object in desiring to have land? Is it to provide their families with milk?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",18
"19","—That itself is a great reason. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",19
"20","2146. And potatoes?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",20
"21","—Potatoes and fruit of the earth as others have. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",21
"22","2147. But, if you had more land, might you not be tempted to forsake and neglect the fishing ?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",22
"23","—If we had more land, we would not risk our lives at sea in rough weather as we now have often to do. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",23
"24","2148. You would then prefer to be a crofter to being a fisherman?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",24
"25","— Yes; it would be better for us. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",25

"37","2154. That was done against their own consent, I presume?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",37

"46","—When the subdivision was made. I cannot say what the rent was when the subdivision actually took place, but the rents actually were raised in proportion as the rents of other townships were raised. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",46
"47","2159. What was the last increase?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",47
"48","—I cannot tell. It was not I who had the lot at that time. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",48
"49","2160. Why did the people send you when you were there only two years ?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",49

"62","2166. Was the sea fishing at Duntulm as good as the fishing here?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",62
"63","— It is better than this, but it is a wilder coast. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",63
"64","2167. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",64
"65","—They want some hill land apparently. Is there land adjoining their croft which could be got easily, or in whose possession is it at present ?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",65

"75","—What is the nature of the restriction that they are not allowed to cut heather for the roofs of the houses or rushes to thatch them with ? Whom does it prejudice ?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",75
"76","—We are not allowed to cut either rushes or heather without leave. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",76
"77","2172. The Chairman.",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",77
"78","—Does the tacksman in reality give you leave to take the grass and heather, or does he absolutely refuse it ?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",78
"79","—He is not refusing it at all. He would give it to the people who would go and ask him. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",79
"80","2173. Does he make you pay anything ?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",80
"81","—He is not asking payment. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",81
"82","2174. Then, why do you put in the paper that you cannot get heather or grass ?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",82
"83","—There are some who cannot get it, though there are others who get the privilege. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",83
"84","2175. Why does the tacksman refuse it to some ?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",84
"85","—There may be some who do not deserve the privilege ; there are others who do. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",85
"86","2176. How can a man not deserve to have the privilege of cutting grass and heather ?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",86

"89","—Do they all do work for the tacksman? ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",89

"94","—He is asking that. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",94
"95","2180. Sheriff Nicolson.",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",95

"103","2183. Did they ever ask the tacksman to allow them to have a cow on his farm and pay for it ?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",103
"104","—I never, asked it. It is a new tacksman we have now. This is his first year. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",104
"105","2184. Did you ever get pasture under the old tacksman ?",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",105
"106","—We could not get that privilege from any of the present tacksman's predecessors. ",35,"John Macdonald","Skye, Uig",106
