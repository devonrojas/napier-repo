"5","36802. What do you wish to say on the part of your people ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",5
"6","—That our land is too highly rented; and it has been increased of recent years on the property on which I live",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",6
"7","—that of Mr Fell. Our peats have become exhausted, and we are obliged to buy coals, which costs us £ 5 or",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",7
"8","£6 a year. ",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",8
"9","36803. How many holdings are there in the township ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",9

"11","36804. Has it always been a crofter township, or only recently established?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",11
"12","—It has been there for a very long time; my father and grandfathers were crofters there before me.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",12
"13","36805. In those days were there more holdings or fewer than there are now ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",13
"14","—There were neither more nor fewer —just the same as now; the township was divided into four parts.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",14

"21","36809. What increases were there in your father's time ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",21
"22","—I cannot tell what the increase of rent was in my father's time, but it was raised; There was a great deal of smuggling going on in the Highlands in those days, and barley brought a good price, and rents were increased in consequence, and they have not been taken down since.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",22
"23","36810. What stock do you keep?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",23

"26","—Two calves and a stirk.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",26

"32","—Thirty years at least.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",32
"33","36815. There has been no increase of rent in your time; there has been no diminution of the area of your croft; and the peats failed more than thirty years ago, and you have been sitting in the farm yourself more than twenty years. I fail to understand exactly what your complaint is ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",33
"34","—Our complaint is that we have to buy coals instead of the fuel we had formerly when we paid the same rent as now.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",34
"35","36816. Have you had a lease ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",35

"38","—The prices have gone up and down in that time.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",38
"39","36818. But with an inclination upwards?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",39
"40","—There were times when they fell as much as they rose.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",40
"41","36819. Has the proprietor done anything for the improvement of your house or farm offices—has he made any expenditure ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",41
"42","—No.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",42
"43","36820. By whom was the house built—your father ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",43
"44","—My father built it. At that time all the tenants built their own houses.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",44
"45","36821. Who is your proprietor?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",45
"46","—Mr Fell.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",46
"47","36822. When improvements are made in the houses does the proprietor make them ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",47

"52","—No; it is not a place for draining—hard, rocky land.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",52
"53","36825. Is there any regulation on the estate providing for compensation for improvements ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",53
"54","—I believe that, where such improvements were made, the tenant paid the half; but I cannot speak certainly, as I have made none myself.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",54
"55","36826. Have there been any arbitrary evictions or removals in your township or the townships round about in your recollection ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",55
"56","—There have been no evictions from any township, so far as I know. There are others who can tell better than I can as to other places with which I have no personal acquaintance. There has been nothing done in my time at this end of the island.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",56
"57","36827. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",57

"62","36829. How long since ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",62

"64","36830. Have you complained ever since you were in possession of the place twenty-four years ago ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",64
"65","—No.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",65
"66","36831. When did you begin to complain?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",66
"67","—Perhaps we complained every time that we paid the rent—complained that there was too much of it to pay.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",67
"68","36832. Have the four occupiers in this township any pasture land ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",68
"69","—No.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",69
"70","36833. Is your arable holding held in common, or does each crofter hold his own ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",70
"71","—Each has his own land surrounded by a dyke.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",71
"72","36834. You say you put your horse out to graze in the summer; how much do you pay for it ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",72
"73","—About £2, 10s. for the half year.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",73
"74","36835. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",74
"75","—You said you had about twenty acres altogether; can you distinguish between the arable and the pasture?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",75
"76","—It varies accordingly as the ground is suitable.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",76
"77","36836. May you, if you choose, turn over the whole of the twenty acres ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",77
"78","—No.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",78
"79","36837. How much is arable ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",79
"80","—I cannot give any estimate of the extent of it. There is a good deal of it quite unfit for cultivation, being  very rocky.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",80
"81","36838. Is there half of it that cannot be tinned over?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",81
"82","—No, not quite so much.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",82
"83","36839. How much do you pay in a year for coals ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",83

"87","36841. Sheriff Nicolson.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",87
"88","—What class of cattle do you keep ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",88
"89","—Highland cattle. It is always Highland cattle we keep here, but not always the same as they used to be. If they were the same as they formerly were they would be of very little worth.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",89
"90","36842. You say the breed has improved ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",90
"91","—Oh, yes; and I believe I may say they get fresh bulls every year.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",91
"92","36343. Do any of the larger farmers keep improved stock—shorthorn crosses ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",92
"93","—I don't know that any of them keep any other stock but Highland, and they are good cattle.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",93

"98","36846. How were they better before?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",98
"99","—I was young then, and the world was not giving me so much care, and therefore I lived better.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",99
"100","36847. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",100
"101","—What would you consider to be a fair rent ?",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",101
"102","—If the price of the coals were deducted from the rent I would be content. We use between seven and eight tons of coal in the year, and, when the price varies from 15s. to 18s. a ton, it comes heavy upon us.",607,"Connell Connel","Argyll, Lismore",102
