"1","ANGUS MACASKILL, (formerly Fisherman), Crofter, Tarbert (75)—examined.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",1
"2","26465. Professor Mackinnon.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",2
"3","—Have you been elected a delegate?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",3
"4","—Yes, by the people of Tarbert and Eddriachillis.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",4
"5","26466. Have-you got a written statement?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",5
"6","—I did commit a little of what I have to say before the commissioners to writing in my own broken",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",6
"7","English, and with your permission I shall read it :",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",7
"8","—That the crofters of this parish had been evicted by their proprietor from their comfortable dwellings to the most barren spots of the parish, that the small quantity of that same is quite inadequate to support the life of those who does labour it. The smallness of it leaves no room for rotation, so that constant cultivation of it weakens the soil, that it cannot yield crop to the advantage of the crofter. Therefore, year by year, their condition is getting more deplorable. There are plenty of good land in this parish under sheep, which if properly divided and cultivated, would give the crofters ample room for to live comfortable by their own industry. The way in which this could be effected is that ten acres of good arable land would be given to each tenant, with a lease of nineteen years, at a reasonable rent by a competent and impartial judge under Government control, as the land should pay its own rent. As seasons is coming across every country that some failure may appear in the crop, every tenant should have some sheep, so as to enable him to have support from his stock. Through the poverty prevailed among the crofters they are unfit to buy sheep for their land. But the Government should buy sheep for them at three and half per cent, per annum, and the full amount to be paid in ten years' time, in various instalments. Their whole proceedings is carried on in the name of the Duke of Sutherland. If grudge or objections is offered by the crofters, the alternative is quit the estate. We were paying roads on rent for forty-nine years' back, but no part is granted as yet. There was a great praise given by his own officials to the second Duke of Sutherland, for granting a free passage to many people from his estate. But as far as known to me not a foot of that peoples land was given to the remaining crofters, turned to a sheep walk. Another grievance is deeply felt here.When the heads of the families are going to their long home, an additional rent is charged upon the croft, say fr om ten to twenty shillings more. If asked why is this extra rent charged, a crooked answer is given that will not stand the light of truth. Through the illiterate condition of our forefathers, no recourse was obtained through the publick prints of face land, so that our forefathers were branded by false reports and defamation of character. But the just judge showed his displeasure against those who depopulated the people, reduced them to beggary, and sent them off the face of the earth with the besom of destruction, as he foretold in his holy Word. The most stout and healthy lads belonging to this parish had to quit their native country, as no room was allowed for them to build houses, and marriage being prohibited, so that the most weak and helpless of them are left. In regard of fishing in this part of the country, there lies in the main ocean a bank, say from twenty to thirty miles off, where cod and ling is plentiful; the only way among us to hive the benefit of that fish is large decked boats; and a small boat to work their lines, but very few of us can obtain such boats, as no fishcurers are residing in this part of the country, and no markets for them, neither a harbour, but what is formed by nature, so that various drawbacks is meeting our fishermen. The amount of money paid for meal annually by this parish is great, so that clothing and food is not what it ought to be. All that privations is attributed to the want of land to support the people by their own industry.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",8

"37","—It would not support me.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",37
"38","26481. You have been fishing as well as crofting?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",38

"42","26483. What is the season of fishing at the bank you speak of?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",42

"48","26486. Do they take away a lot of money?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",48
"49","—A lot of fish.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",49
"50","26487. That means about the same thing?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",50
"51","—They get money in their own country for the fish.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",51
"52","26488. Do they salt the fish themselves?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",52

"55","—Yes, and doing well according to the materials they have.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",55
"56","26490. Could they not get better material?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",56

"64","26494. Where is the good land you speak of that the people may get?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",64
"65","—There is one farm. Mr Gunn's farm, Kyle Strome, and I hold that would supply all the crofters in Eddriachillis.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",65

"71","26497. Do you think if people were going there the herring would come back?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",71

"73","26498. Mr Fraser Mackintosh.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",73
"74","—Were there many people turned out of Assynt where you were turned out fifty years ago?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",74
"75","—A good many.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",75
"76","26499. Who did it?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",76
"77","—It was all done under the Sutherland family's name; there were inferiors under them, but it was all done in their name.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",77

"86","—Certainly it was.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",86
"87","26504. Are there many crofters in this district of Eddrachillis?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",87

"92","—No, we don't.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",92
"93","26507. Is it because he is an old man that he does not trouble you?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",93
"94","—No, but because he is an inferior, and therefore should submit to his superior. Of course, my lord, whether you are a lord or a gentleman, you would be displeased if your servants did not do your bidding : a servant must obey.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",94
"95","26508. But you are not complaining of him in any way?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",95

"103","26512. Would many of them be able to stock larger crofts'?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",103
"104","—It is not consistent with reason that men reduced to poverty would be able to buy stock at first, but in such a good pasture the stock would pay itself.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",104

"111","26516. Have you any other statement you wish to make?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",111

"113","26517. Sheriff Nicolson.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",113
"114","—I think you speak very good English, were you always in the position of a crofter?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",114
"115","—I am glad such a competent judge would give me that character.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",115
"116","26518. Have you ever had any other vocation but that of crofter and fisherman? where did you learn to speak English?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",116
"117","—At home; I have been once or twice in Glasgow, but it was little learning I got there.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",117
"118","26519. You were never a teacher?",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",118
"119","—No. I attended the old parochial school in Assynt. In childhood I was such a long distance from school that I did not attend, but in my young days I was bestowed with a good memory, and I learned some of my English from books.",446,"Angus Macaskill","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",119
