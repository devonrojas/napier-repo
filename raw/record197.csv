"1","JOHN M'CASKILL, Crofter and Fisherman, Eriskay (38)—examined.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",1
"2","11608. The Chairman.—Have you been freely elected a delegate?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",2
"3","— Yes. ",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",3
"4","11609. Professor Mackinnon.—How many are there paying rent in Eriskay ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",4
"5","—There are eighty-four paying rent in our island. Three occupied it formerly.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",5
"6","11610. Is there any that does not pay rent?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",6
"7","—Yes.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",7
"8","11611. How many?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",8
"9","—There will be about a dozen families who pay no rent—chiefly paupers.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",9
"10","11612. Of those who do pay rent, what is the largest and what is the smallest rent?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",10
"11","—So far as I know, the biggest rent is £5, and the lowest is as low as 10s.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",11
"12","11613. What is the stock that a man who pays £ 5 has?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",12
"13","—Four or five cows, two or three small cattle, two horses, and between ten and twelve sheep.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",13
"14","11614. What land or stock has a man who pays 10s. ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",14
"15","—He may have a cow ; I don't know of any more.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",15
"16","11615. What is your complaint then ? Is it that there are too many people upon that island ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",16
"17","—Yes, that is my complaint. There are three times the number on that island that should be on it.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",17
"18","11616. You don't complain that the rents are too high?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",18
"19","—Yes, people complain that they pay too high rent.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",19
"20","11617. But the larger complaint is that there are too many of them ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",20
"21","— Yes, generally there are two families residing upon each small bit of croft.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",21
"22","11618. You said that three had the island once; how long is that ago ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",22
"23","—About thirty-five or thirty-six years ago.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",23
"24","11619. Where did all the others come from?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",24
"25","—They came from the opposite side of the ground. They were sent across to the island.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",25
"26","11620. From Barra or Uist?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",26
"27","—From Uist.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",27
"28","11621. And you would wish to send a good number of them back again ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",28
"29","—If they had any livelihood, it is that which should be done. The place which they left is still there under cattle and sheep, where they were making a good living.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",29
"30","11622. Who occupies that place now ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",30
"31","—Mr Robert Fergusson.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",31
"32","11623. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—What is the name of the place?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",32
"33","—Kilbride.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",33
"34","11624. Professor Mackinnon.—Is the place there very suitable for crofters?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",34
"35","—It is very suitable for fishing and crofting. A share of the present population of the island came from as far north as Benmore and as far south as the island of Boreray.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",35
"36","11625. How many families do you think should be left upon the island to occupy it now",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",36
"37","—The soil has become exhausted through continuous as cropping, and where we are now workiug is nothing but rock, and the other places are bogs, ditches, aud big rocks. I think we might make a livelihood if one crofter to-day had the land of three.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",37
"38","11626. Are you able to pay your rents?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",38
"39","—They are doing their best generally.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",39
"40","11627. If the crofts generally were trebled, as you say, and one man put in the place of three, are there men in the island who would be able to take the stock of their two neighbours?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",40
"41","—No, if the arrears or debt upon the island were paid it would take all its present stock to do so.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",41
"42","11628. Supposing you had the people reduced to one-third of the present population would they all be crofting the land, or would they be fishing as well ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",42
"43","—If we had means to enable us to stock the land, as I suggested, people would prefer working on the land to fishing. The fish has deserted the place.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",43
"44","11629. But supposing the fish came back again, would fishing not be more profitable than crofting ? WThat remedy would you propose, or what was the remedy the people of Eriskay asked you to propose here, to improve their condition ",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",44
"45","—The people think if they had plenty of land, and means of stocking it, that they would be well",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",45
"46","11630. Whom do they expect to provide the means of stocking the land ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",46
"47","—We don't know anything about that.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",47
"48","11631. Have you a school ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",48
"49","—Yes.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",49
"50","11632. Is there a church ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",50
"51","—Yes.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",51
"52","11633. Are the people Roman Catholics ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",52
"53","—Except two or three families.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",53
"54","11634. I suppose the church there is a Roman Catholic church?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",54
"55","—Yes.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",55
"56","11635. Do some of the people of Eriskay go south?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",56
"57","—They always go to the east coast fishing.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",57
"58","11636. But I suppose they always come home again?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",58
"59","—They mostly return back next winter, except a few young men who go abroad in ships,",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",59
"60","11637. Do any of the young women go away?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",60
"61","—Yes, young women go south to work.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",61
"62","11638. Do they remain away?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",62
"63","—Some of them remain away and some of them return.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",63
"64","11639. I suppose there are no families who go away and leave the place ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",64
"65","—I don't know of any family who left our place at all.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",65
"66","11640 If the people are so poor as you say they are, how is it that some of the families don't go to some other place, where they would be better off?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",66
"67","—I don't know what is their reason for not going.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",67
"68","11641. Are you a crofter?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",68
"69","—I have half a croft.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",69
"70","11642. Could you not better yourself in another place than Eriskay ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",70
"71","—I don't know.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",71
"72","11643. You were often abroad?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",72
"73","—I was often abroad, and if I had scope to work at home in a way that would be satisfactory, I would prefer being at home to being abroad.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",73
"74","11644. What places were you away abroad in?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",74
"75","—I was round the coast of Scotland generally, and in England, Ireland, and America.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",75
"76","11645. As a sailor?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",76
"77","—As a sailor.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",77
"78","11646. And you think that in none of these places you could make for yourself a home more comfortable than in Eriskay ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",78
"79","—If I had means of satisfactorily keeping the place at home, there is no other place where I would be so healthy and happy.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",79
"80","11647 I quite believe that, but when evidently the people have not that means, how is it they don't go to some other place ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",80
"81","—We don't know where that place is.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",81
"82","11648. And you have been in all the countries you have mentioned?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",82
"83","—Yes.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",83
"84","11649. What is the total population of this island?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",84
"85","—I believe it is between 400 and 500.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",85
"86","11650. Have you any idea of the total rent of the island?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",86
"87","—I don't know.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",87
"88","11651. Do you know the names of the three people who occupied the island ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",88
"89","—There was one Macdonald, one Fergussou, and one Cameron.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",89
"90","11652. What might be the population of the island then ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",90
"91","—I am not aware. The population just consisted of the families of those three tenants, with a few shepherds and herds.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",91
"92","11653. Then it would probably amount to thirty or forty people?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",92
"93","—I don't think there would be so many.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",93
"94","116 54. You have said nothing about peats? Where do you get your peats ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",94
"95","—The peats are well-nigh exhausted altogether. In two or three years more there will be none.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",95
"96","11655. Was there some pasture upon the top of the peat moss which they have been cutting ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",96
"97","—In some places.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",97
"98","11656. Did you or did any of the people on the island make any representation to the proprietor or to the factor to relieve the island of this large population, by removal abroad or in any other way ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",98
"99","—They were often complaining that there was such a surplus population on the island that they could not live.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",99
"100","11657. But did you make any formal application?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",100
"101","—I am not aware there was any special request made by the people to remove the surplus population.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",101
"102","11658. You have heard, no doubt, that since the present Lady Cathcart became proprietrix, she has been doing a good deal upon the estate, and giving promises of more ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",102
"103","—I did hear so, and we are very much in need of her assistance.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",103
"104","11659. Why then did not you and the other heads of families put your heads together and make a petition to her to relieve your condition ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",104
"105","—We did not do so, we are but a poor lot of people without any scholar among us to do that much for us, although we have got a school.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",105
"106","11660. Sheriff Nicolson.—You have a school at Eriskay ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",106
"107","—Yes.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",107
"108","11661. One of the public schools?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",108
"109","—Yes.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",109
"110","11662. You have always had a school there?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",110
"111","—No, not always. There was a Free Church school in the island before they built the public school.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",111
"112","11663. Are there many people in the island who cannot read or write?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",112
"113","—Almost all the population, except the young children who are at school, cannot read nor write. A few about my own time of life perhaps got a little education, but very few.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",113
"114","11664. Do the children attend the school regularly?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",114
"115","—They are compelled to do so.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",115
"116","11665. Is there an officer who looks after them?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",116
"117","—Yes.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",117
"118","11666. Does he threaten them if they don't attend?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",118
"119","—Yes.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",119
"120","11667. Do the people complain of the rates they have to pay for the school ?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",120
"121","—Yes, they think it dear.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",121
"122","11668. How much do they pay iu the pound?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",122
"123","—5d. in the pound—1d. on the landlord and 4d. on the tenant.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",123
"124","11669. Don't you think it a very good pennyworth?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",124
"125","—We know it is. The great majority are fishermen. Fishing has been very backward for a few years back, and people are now in great debt.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",125
"126","11670. Are they not also in great arrears?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",126
"127","—I don't know the amount of arrears, but I am sure they are deep in debt to the merchant with whom they deal for their food. The one who has been keeping them up for a number of years, if he chose to force paymant, the most of the present stock would belong to him.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",127
"128","11671. Is he a merchant there or here?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",128
"129","—He is a merchant both there and on this side, Mr Fergusson.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",129
"130","11672. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",130
"131","—Suppose the offer were made to you to emigrate to America under favourable conditions in families, would the people be disposed to accept that?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",131
"132","—They would not care about going abroad if they could live at home, and get restored to the places where they came from.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",132
"133","11673. Sheriff Nicolson.—I suppose the other men from Eriskay have nothing different to tell us from what you have told us?",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",133
"134","—I am not aware there is anything different from what I have said.",197,"John Mccaskill","South Uist, Lochboisdale",134
