"2","16210. The Chairman.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",2
"3","—How many families are there at Branahine?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",3
"4","—There are twenty-four families paying rent, and there are about three who don't pay rent.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",4
"5","16211. Do you represent the tenants, or both the tenants and cottars?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",5
"6","—I represent both.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",6
"7","16212. How many were present when you were elected?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",7
"8","—There were considerably more than the half present.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",8
"9","16213. And you and Donald Morrison were freely elected?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",9
"10","—Yes.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",10
"11","16214. You produce a paper. Was that prepared before that meeting at which you were elected ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",11
"12","—It was prepared after I was elected.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",12
"13","16215. Did you write it yourself ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",13
"14","—No.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",14
"15","16216. Was it dictated ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",15
"16","—Yes, we dictated it. The whole township was present when it was being written",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",16
"17","—Branahine, May 29, 1883. To the Royal Commissioners of Inquiry of the Grievances of the Highlands and Islands. Honoured Gentlemen—Having this opportunity of stating our grievances, we the undersigned do hereby state some of them briefly as follows :",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",17
"18","—1st, Previous to Sir James Matheson obtaining the island of Lewis, Branahine consisted of fifteen crofters, paying £60 rent, now it consists of twenty-five crofters, with an aditional rental of £16. 2nd, all the common pasturage which our ancestors had was taken from us with very little exception, and given to large farms; also the sea-weeds which were annexed to our crofts was taken from us and given to Melbost farm, which was not in its immediate vicinity. Last of all, the township of Melbost was thrust on the little pasturage that was left us with their cattle, so that we have to pay for the grazing of our cattle from the one end of the year to the other, on the very ground which we ourselves had less than forty years ago, but now in the possession of strangers, so that those that were rearing a stock of six milch cows with three or four of smaller animals cannot rear one single cow without buying her food. If a large amount of money were expended on this island as an excuse of raising our rents, it was more to our ruin than for our improvement, for we challenge anyone who can prove that one single shilling was spent in improving our crofts or houses.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",18
"19","16217. When were the additional crofters thrown upon you? ",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",19
"20","—From fifteen to twenty years ago.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",20
"21","16218. You are referring to the township of Branahine ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",21
"22","— Yes. ",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",22
"23","16219. Where did the additional ten crofters now at Branahinc come from ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",23
"24","—The township in the parish next to us called Holm was cleared, and the people thrown in upon us.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",24
"25","16220. Were you in possession of a croft at that time ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",25
"26","—Yes.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",26
"27","16221. Have you got that land still, or did you lose part of it ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",27
"28","—I have it yet. I lost nothing of my croft strictly so called, but these people were thrown in upon us at the upper portion of our township, and the new lots were lotted out to them there, so that our hill pasture was reduced in that way.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",28
"29","16222. Was any of the land on the new lots improved or did the tenants improve it themselves ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",29
"30","—A little of the land was improved for them by the proprietor.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",30
"31","16223. Have they improved more themselves since then?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",31
"32","—Yes, much more.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",32
"33","16224. Do you know at what rent they were settled there?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",33
"34","—I could not tell, but I believe each pays about £ 4 to-day.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",34
"35","16225. Has their rent been raised since they entered upon these lots?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",35
"36","—Yes, for additional pasture land they got,",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",36
"37","16226. But their rent has not been raised in consequence of their own improvements ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",37
"38","—I believe not.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",38
"39","16227. The £16 additional of which you speak applies, I suppose, to those crofters who had land improved for them ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",39
"40","—No, this additional £16 was added to the original crofts, not to these others that were sent in at all. This portion of ground at the back of our crofts was taken from us, and no abatement was made in consequence of that, and the £16 additional was added on all the same.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",40
"41","16228. What is the rent of the whole twenty-four to-day?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",41
"42","—I cannot tell accurately,",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",42
"43","16229. Were the present inhabitants of Melbost brought to Melbost of late years ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",43
"44","—No, there have always been people in Melbost. When Melbost people lost their land, they were added to our township, and they have themselves no portion of the out pasture which originally belonged to the township—nothing except what is within the ring fence.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",44
"45","16230. Then at present the Branahine pasture is common to the Branahine people and the Melbost people ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",45
"46","—Yes.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",46
"47","16231. Do the Melbost people pay additional rent for this pasture they got from the Branahine people ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",47
"48","—There was no separate arrangement with regard to rent. They pay the rent they paid before when they had their own pasture land.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",48
"49","16232. What rent do you yourself pay?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",49
"50","—I got fresh land. It was very rough, and I took it all in myself. I trenched and drained it, and I pay about 21s. of bare rent for it.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",50
"51","16233. How long is it since you got this piece of ground?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",51
"52","—Over twenty years.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",52
"53","16234. Where were you before then ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",53
"54","—Always in the township. My father and grandfather were there before me.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",54
"55","16235. Who has the land your father and grandfather had before you ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",55
"56","—A brother of mine.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",56
"57","16236. Then this increase from sixteen to twenty-five is not entirely by parties brought in ; it is partly by the natural increase of the population?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",57
"58","—Yes, some is due to the increase of the place.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",58
"59","16237. Do you know how much is due to each cause?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",59
"60","—I could not tell at the moment.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",60
"61","16238. How much land have you got ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",61
"62","—About four acres of improved land.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",62
"63","16239 . What stock do you keep?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",63
"64","—One cow and one sheep. I also keep a horse; but my rent does not allow me to keep a horse, and I arrange with another man for its keep.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",64
"65","16240. What does the keep of the horse cost?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",65
"66","—Well, the horse is grazed by a son-in-law of my own, and that makes it cheaper.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",66
"67","16241. Do you plough the croft with the horse, or let it out for hire ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",67
"68","—Yes, I plough my croft with it, and I hire the horse out too.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",68
"69","16242. Have you any promise of compensation for the land you improved ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",69
"70","—I have no promise.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",70
"71","16243. Have you any promise of being allowed to hold it for any length of time ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",71
"72","—Nothing of the kind. We are told we have no claim upon anything beyond the bounds of arable ground. Supposing we make any complaint with regard to the out hill pasture, we are told that we have no cause of complaint with regard to it—that our rights are limited by arable ground.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",72
"73","16244. By ' we ' you mean those who got hill to improve?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",73
"74","—I mean the whole of the crofters in the place.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",74
"75","16245. Mr Cameron.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",75
"76","—What do you and those whom you represent wish should be done now to remedy the state of matters ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",76
"77","—More pasture ground, and relief from the heavy pressure of the burdens of rent and taxation that are laid upon us.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",77
"78","16246. Do you think your rent of £ 1 , 1s. is high for the amount of ground you have got and the cow and sheep which you keep ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",78
"79","—No, I would not consider it too high if it had other necessaries attached to it. ",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",79
"80","16247. You mean more pasture, I suppose ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",80
"81","—Yes, more pasture.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",81
"82","16248. But if you had more pasture would you expect to pay more rent or would you expect the pasture in addition to what you have all for the guinea ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",82
"83","—That piece of pasture ground at the back of our crofts which was taken from us we still pay a rent for, in respect that there was no abatement made when we were deprived of it. Some of it was restored to us.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",83
"84","16249. But you say you consider your rent would not be high if you had other advantages added to it. If you had other advantages, would you expect to get it for the same rent, or would you be prepared to pay additional for it?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",84
"85","—We were deprived of pasture, and there was no abatement of rent.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",85
"86","16250. I understand you think you ought to have the same holding with additional pasture for the same rent ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",86
"87","—It would be easier for me to pay additional rent if I had some more pasture.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",87
"88","16251. Where is this land to be got, and who holds the additional pasture which you wish to get?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",88
"89","—The old moorland pastures of the township are now attached to the tack of Upper Holm.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",89
"90","16252. Do you know whether that tacksman has a long lease or not?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",90
"91","—I cannot telL",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",91
"92","16253. Suppose the proprietor found that at the expiry of this lease more land could be added to the crofts— do you think the crofters could stock the land, or do you agree with the statement made by other delegates, that the Government should assist the crofters to stock the land ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",92
"93","—I think we will require Government assistance, as previous delegates said.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",93
"94","16254. It is stated here that in the improvements that were executed by the proprietor not one shilling was spent in improving your crofts or houses. I understand that refers to tho old crofts, but that some improvements were made on the new crofts ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",94
"95","—These additional crofts that were cut out of the back portion of their crofts, and upon which some money was expended, are called by a separate name. It is a distinct township now, and so the statement is true that not one penny Was expended on our township. ",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",95
"96","16255. But money was spent upon crofters in a different locality ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",96
"97","—Yes, the proprietor expended money in improving crofts at Holm, but these don't belong to our parish. Holm is in the parish of Stornoway.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",97
"98","16256. Were the people who were employed in making these improvements natives of the place ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",98
"99","—They were Harris men, the greater portion of them. Some belonged to the place.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",99
"100","16257. Was there much other work going on at that time in the district ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",100
"101","—Yes, there was a good deal. It was at the time people were removed from Harris and they came over upon the Lewis side of the march in order to provide for their families. It was the neighbourhood  of Stornoway they came to.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",101
"102","16258. I suppose the people prefer getting work at home to having to go south to find it ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",102
"103","—Very much.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",103
"104","16259. Have the crofters had their attention directed to the new estate regulations with respect to the improvement of houses ",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",104
"105","—Yes, all the people have seen the leases.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",105
"106","16260. Have the people in your township taken advantage of these regulations to improve their houses ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",106
"107","—Yes, there are some that have taken advantage to some extent of these regulations, but we have no great encouragement in doing so when we have no security against removal. We had not even a lease of the place.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",107
"108","16261. Don't the regulations themselves give that very security you ask for ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",108
"109","—I have not seen that any one among us has got it yet.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",109
"110","16262. Have you asked for it?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",110
"111","—I cannot say that we did.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",111
"112","16263. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",112
"113","—What is the name of the tenant of Holm ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",113
"114","—Mr Helme.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",114
"115","16264. Is Holm a good farm?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",115
"116","—Yes, it is a good farm.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",116
"117","16265. Were any improvements made upon that farm by the proprietor?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",117
"118","—Yes, a good deal.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",118
"119","16266. What was the nature of them?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",119
"120","—Fences were set up, parks were made, and a good deal of it was trenched.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",120
"121","16267. Is all the land that was one under cutlivation by crofters cultivated on that farm ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",121
"122","—Yes, the whole of it was cultivated, as far as I can make out, and more.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",122
"123","16268. Do you know how many pairs of horses he keeps ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",123
"124","—There are two pairs always.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",124
"125","16269. Do you know how many families reside upon that farm ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",125
"126","—I am not aware there is more than one family—the grieve's family. The rest are unmarried people who work the farm.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",126
"127","16270. Has he got any cottars dependent upon him other than those who are necessary to work the farm ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",127
"128","—No.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",128
"129","16271. Are there sheep upon this farm of Holm ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",129
"130","—Yes.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",130
"131","16272. A good lot?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",131
"132","—They vary. The tenant has two or three other tacks, so that he can change the stock.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",132
"133","16273. In this island ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",133
"134","— He has other two upon this estate.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",134
"135","16274. Where are these ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",135
"136","—Galston and Upper Barvas.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",136
"137","16275. Was it for the benefit of the people that were once upon this farm of Holm that they were removed to other places ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",137
"138","—They were not willing to go. They were sent away against their will, and the lands they had were added to the tack upon each side of them.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",138
"139","16276. Have the people been falling off ever since in their circumstances—those that were so removed?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",139
"140","—They are not better off now than they were then.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",140
"141","16277. Who has got the farm of Melbost now?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",141
"142","—Mrs Houston.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",142
"143","16278. Were there people removed from that farm?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",143
"144","—No, but all the out pasture was taken from them.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",144
"145","16279. Was that of considerable consequence to them ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",145
"146","—Yes, it was of very great consequence to them. The loss of it was of great injury to them.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",146
"147","16280. Was the position of your father much better than your own ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",147
"148","—Yes, he was well off. He lacked nothing that was necessary for a man's support.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",148
"149","16281. Have you yourself been industrious all your days, endeavouring to make the best of it ?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",149
"150","—Yes.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",150
"151","16282. And yet you are a poor man?",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",151
"152","—Yes. My position is nothing compared with what my father's was.",295,"Alexander Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",152
