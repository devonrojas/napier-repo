"1","Rev. JAMES FRASER, Minister of the Congregational Church, Sulem (70)—examined.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",1
"2","21214. The Chairman.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",2
"3","—Is your communion a very numerous one in these islands?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",3
"4","—Not very numerous.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",4
"5","21215. From what date has it existed?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",5
"6","—I am not able to fix the precise date. I think it is just about as old as the century.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",6
"7","21216. Under whose influence was it established?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",7
"8","—Under the influence of the late brothers, Robert and James Haldane.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",8
"9","21217. And since their death it has supported itself?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",9
"10","—Yes.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",10
"11","21218. Do you stand in immediate connection with the English congregations in the same communion?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",11
"12","—Not in immediate connection, but pretty close.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",12
"13","21219. Is the Scotch Congregationalist Church a separate organisation?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",13
"14","—Scarcely. They are very nearly amalgamated, but there are some slight differences.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",14
"15","21220. Do you receive any pecuniary assistance or encouragement from your English co-religionists?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",15
"16","—Not at all.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",16
"17","21221. They don't do anything for the Northern churches?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",17
"18","—There may be individual cases of assistance in building churches, but there is nothing done systematically.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",18
"19","21222. You don't depend upon your richer brethren in London at all?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",19
"20","—No, certainly not.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",20
"21","21223. How long have you been settled here?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",21
"22","—.Since 1847.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",22
"23","21224. And in what class of people does your strength lie—are your adherents among the crofting population and fishermen? ",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",23
"24","—Yes.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",24
"25","21225. The lower class —the labouring people?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",25
"26","—Yes.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",26
"27","21226. Since you have been here do you think the condition of the people has been improving physically and morally?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",27
"28","—Yes, I think it has. The improvement is slow, but I think it is visible.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",28
"29","21227. Sheriff Nicolson.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",29
"30","—Are you a native of this island?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",30
"31","—Yes.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",31
"32","21228. Then, you are well acquainted with the inhabitants and their customs?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",32
"33","—Yes, I think so.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",33
"34","21229. And do you think, on the whole, their living is as good now as it was before or better?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",34
"35","—I think it is better on the whole.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",35
"36","21230. Is there any difference in their moral conduct, for which I think they have been always honourably distinguished?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",36
"37","—I think they have improved considerably in morals since I can remember.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",37
"38","21231. Intemperance has never been one of their vices?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",38
"39","—No, not as a rule. There have been some cases in the island, but it is not general.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",39
"40","21232. There are no public houses in this parish?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",40
"41","—No.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",41
"42","21233. Has that always been the case?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",42
"43","—-Well, I think it has always been much the same as it is.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",43
"44","21234. Is that ever felt to be a grievance?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",44
"45","—Not at all.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",45
"46","21235. You mean by natives?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",46
"47","—I don't think it is felt to be a grievance.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",47
"48","21236. Don't strangers find it a grievance?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",48
"49","—I don't know what they feel.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",49
"50","21237. It has never been the custom here so much as in the Hebrides, for young men to go south to work in the harvest?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",50
"51","—No, the young men here mainly go to sea.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",51
"52","21238. And the young women don't go away?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",52
"53","—They go south and take service.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",53
"54","21239. Have they been always in the habit of doing so to any great extent?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",54
"55","—No, only lately. There were very few going south when I remember first; but they go very largely now.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",55
"56","21240. Has that any influence for good or evil on their character?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",56
"57","—I could not say. Some of the men that go to sea improve their condition very much, and a number of them become masters, mates, and officers.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",57
"58","21241. But as regards the young men in particular?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",58
"59","—I am not so well acquainted with the circumstances of the young men in regard to that. I don't think there is a great deal of improvement.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",59
"60","21242. Has there been any great progress in education within your recollection here?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",60
"61","—There has been.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",61
"62","21243. How many schools were there when you came here?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",62
"63","—There was the Parochial school, and others were got up by private individuals, or by public subscriptions. I don't remember that there was any other fixed school, but that of the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge at Esha Ness.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",63
"64","21244. There were a number of places far removed from school?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",64
"65","—Yes, a number.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",65
"66","21245. And now there is a sufficient number of schools within reach of all children fit to go?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",66
"67","—Yes, but some have a considerable distance to go still.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",67
"68","21246. Have any to go more than three miles?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",68
"69","—I think there are some that have fully three miles to go; and the difficulty is increased by the want of roads, and the existence of burns over which there are no bridges. And in the winter time the children are not able to go through the marshy ground without wetting their feet and being exposed to danger by afterwards sitting in school during the day. That has a considerable effect in lessening the attendance at school.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",69
"70","21247. The people of these islands are naturally of a religious disposition?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",70
"71","—Yes, they are naturally morally disposed.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",71
"72","21248. Do you find in that respect there is any falling off from their old feelings?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",72
"73","—I cannot say I do.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",73
"74","21249. Do they attend ordinances as well as they used to do?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",74
"75","—Yes, they do; there may be individual cases of falling off and neglect, but the people generally attend.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",75
"76","21250. Do you know of anything in the circumstances of the people making it necessary for this Commission to come here?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",76
"77","—I think it is possible some advantage may be reaped by the people from this Commission—at least I hope so.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",77
"78","21251. Do you think there are any serious matters of complaint which it would be well that the Government and the public should know of?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",78
"79","—The principal matters of complaint have been referred to before—the system that prevails beteen landlord and tenant —the tenant at will system—the tenant may be turned off on forty days' warning. Then there is no compensation for improvement; and that having existed from time immemorial has almost blotted out the disposition to improve, and consequently improvement has almost stopped. There are a great many improvements which might be carried out if there were fixity of tenure and compensation for improvements. That grievance, I think, is universally felt throughout the Shetland Islands. The existing state of matters is not owing to the present proprietors or factors; it has always been the same. At every reference I make to improvement, I am met by this, that they have no security and no prospect of compensation; and the result is that the people spend many days in idleness when they might be improving their small crofts and making them better for themselves and the people.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",79
"80","21252. Mr Cameron.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",80
"81","—Would the people be satisfied with compensation without security, if they got it?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",81
"82","—-I think they would do a great deal which they don't do now.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",82
"83","21253. Are you aware that there is a bill before Parliament providing for compensation for improvement?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",83
"84","—I am aware of that.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",84
"85","21254. What number of years' lease do you think the people would be satisfied with?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",85
"86","—I think a lease for nineteen or twenty-one years.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",86
"87","21255. Are the conditions in regard to houses satisfactory between landlord and tenant just now?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",87
"88","—That would be settled according to the other conditions of the lease.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",88
"89","21256. Who repairs the people's houses now—landlord or tenant?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",89
"90","—Sometimes the one and sometimes the other; generally the landlord if it is any great repair.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",90
"91","21257. That is the custom of the country?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",91
"92","—Yes, generally.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",92
"93","21258. I suppose there have not been many evictions on a large scale in these islands?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",93
"94","—To some extent, but not upon a large scale.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",94
"95","21259. Have there been any in this parish at all?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",95
"96","—No, not what may be properly called evictions; none since I came to the parish.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",96
"97","21260. You have heard of none amongst the people with whom you have been coming into contact?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",97
"98","—No. There have been some proprietors laying down grazing parks, but, generally speaking, some provision has been made for the tenants.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",98
"99","21261. Supposing leases were granted to the crofters would you make any reduction for loss of common pasture or scathold?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",99
"100","—I would very much like if there was a right understanding about that; at present there is no proper understanding about it. The people have always had the right to the pasture here, and that has not been interfered with; but in other parishes it has been taken from the people, and there is still an understanding that they have a right to it, and that creates a great deal of heart-burning and dissatisfaction, and makes the conditon of the people worse than it would otherwise be.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",100
"101","21262. But with regard to these parishes where the scathold has not been taken away, and where the conditions under which the cattle, ponies, and sheep are grazed are satisfactory?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",101
"102","—There have been some questions about that; but the conditions are tolerably satisfactory. One thing, however, is that the people do not know how long the existing state of things may last, and no doubt a better arrangement or distribution might be made. There have been several questions put about the dissatisfaction of some of the tenants with regard to others having stock on the hill pasture, and not allowing them the same chance, and some better arrangement about that should be made.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",102
"103","21263. Have you any suggestion to make which you think would meet with the approval of the people?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",103
"104","—I have not, because, although I have conversed with the people about it they have never suggested anything that might be an improvement; but I should think —and I have suggested to the factor himself —that if so many sheep were allowed the tenant for each £of rent, the tenants who have more might be taxed for their over stock.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",104
"105","21264. What do you mean by taxed?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",105
"106","—That they should pay so much for the sheep. In some places in Shetland the people pay as much as a shilling per head.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",106
"107","21265. By a tax you mean something added to the rent?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",107
"108","—That so much should be paid for every sheep—added to the rent could that arrangement be simply and easily carried out? ",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",108
"109","—It might be for ought I know.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",109
"110","21266. You are aware that in Scotland the practice on the crofting farms is to have a certain stock called the summing, which every crofter is entitled to, put upon the common pasture?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",110
"111","—I think something of that kind would be judicious and right. At the present time there is a misunderstanding on the subject It seems to stand in this way: the tenant is very apt to look at it from the custom which has existed from time immemorial. When, for instance, you see advertisements of land to be sold, it is spoken of as so many acres or merks of arable land with the right of so much hill pasture. The hill pasture is not properly bought, but it enhances the value of the arable land, and from time immemorial. the tenant has held the arable land and so much hill pasture;—it may be mentioned or it may be not. It was not paid for per se, but it was held under scathold, and was held to enhance the value of the arable land. Now, in many cases, it is taken from the tenants, and they are told they are to pay for nothing but what is within the arable land. They don't believe that, and hence the heart-burning and dissatisfaction which prevail. That does not exist here, but nobody knows how soon a change may take place.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",111
"112","21267. Have you heard that a crofter with a large scathold has a fear of selling a beast or sheep to any neighbour?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",112
"113","—I have heard that.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",113
"114","21268. Do you know why it is so?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",114
"115","—I don't know. I believe in some places it is something like a superstitious fear that it will take away the luck; but I am not aware of that existing in my own neighbourhood, nor do I think it exists in this parish. I think any person here would sell to anyone else, whether a neighbour or not.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",115
"116","21269. If he got a good price he would put the luck on one side?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",116
"117","—I have no doubt of it. But I have known places in Shetland where the people would not do that. I think, however, that superstition is passing away mostly everywhere.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",117
"118","21270. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",118
"119","—When a man has a large stock is he not jealous of his neighbours?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",119
"120","—That, I believe, arises from the depravity of human nature.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",120
"121","21271. The grazing on the scathold is limited, and if everybody held a big stock he would not fare so well?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",121
"122","—No, certainly not.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",122
"123","21272. The Chairman.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",123
"124","—Suppose that in the township the scathold has been nearly fully occupied by two or three of the richer or more fortunate tenants, and that there are two or three poorer who have got none or only a few animals between them, and suppose these poor tenants become a little better off and are able to put more stock, and wish to have their fair share upon the ground, have they any means of reducing the stock of their richer neighbours, and of getting their own stock put on the scathold?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",124
"125","—No, not so far as I know.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",125
"126","21273. Such a case must surely have arisen, what do they do?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",126
"127","—They do nothing, so far as I am aware. That is a thing which I think the proprietor should put right. ",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",127
"128","21274. They don't appeal to the proprietor about it?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",128
"129","—They may speak about it, but there is very seldom any interference upon his part.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",129
"130","21275. Is there any rumour of any intention upon the part of the factor to form a farm out of the scathold?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",130
"131","—No, I don't think there is.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",131
"132","21276. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",132
"133","—There are several proprietors in this parish?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",133
"134","—Yes.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",134
"135","21277. And I suppose what you state is something like this —that although the state of the crofters at present is fairly good compared with other parts of Shetland, yet their future is very doubtful?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",135
"136","—That is what I mean. And, therefore, their state is not satisfactory. It is not satisfactory.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",136
"137","21278. And improvements are, to a great extent, at a stand still?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",137
"138","—At a complete stand still.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",138
"139","21279. You said that, some time ago, there were not so many young women going to service in the south as now?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",139
"140","—Yes.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",140
"141","21280. What is the reason for that; is it because the people are poorer and the young people are obliged to leave their homes?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",141
"142","—I don't think so; I can hardly tell the reason.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",142
"143","21281. But you would not put it upon the score that their families at home are poorer than they used to be?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",143
"144","—No, I rather put it upon this, that they are anxious to improve their condition—more anxious than they were perhaps fifty years ago.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",144
"145","21282. Professor Mackinnon.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",145
"146","—Do you know of any case of the hill being overstocked?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",146
"147","—I do not think it is overstocked. They generally find the remedy for overstocked pasture in a severe winter.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",147
"148","21283. That is, the stock will be lost?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",148
"149","—Yes.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",149
"150","21284. The winter comes and reduces the stock to very satisfactory dimensions?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",150
"151","—Yes.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",151
"152","21285. But it is just as hard upon the one who has few as upon the one who has many?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",152
"153","—Yes, that is the worst of it.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",153
"154","21286. So that there is no limit or equality of stock in respect of the capacity of the croft for wintering stock?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",154
"155","—Yes, there is inequality, and there always must be for various reasons.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",155
"156","21287. And you would approve of the practice we have in Scotland to prevent that—that every man should have a right to so much either in proportion to his arable land; or in proportion to his rent—a definite fixed thing?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",156
"157","—Yes, I should like some definite fixed thing.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",157
"158","21288. And while adding an additional rent for additional stock would you make a reduction for a reduced stock?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",158
"159","—I think so.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",159
"160","21289. The one would carry the other?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",160
"161","—I don't know that the additional rent would be very acceptable. I think their rent is generally as high as it should be.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",161
"162","21290. The practice in Scotland very often is, that when one has overstock he pays to his neighbour who has a reduced stock?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",162
"163","—Matters are very different indeed from what I remember in that respect.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",163
"164","21291. In what respect?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",164
"165","—There is a greater equality now than there used to be forty or fifty years ago.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",165
"166","21292. So that matters are improving as it is?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",166
"167","—Yes, as regards equality and stock on the pasture.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",167
"168","21293. The Chairman.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",168
"169","—I think you said that if a man kept more than his legitimate share he ought to pay a small rent for the number of sheep to the landlord—would it not be more equitable that he should pay to his neighbour who has a deficient stock ",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",169
"170","—Far more; but the difficulty would be to get that settled. ",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",170
"171","21294. Professor Mackinnon.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",171
"172","—The people should see to it that the one who has too much should pay to the one who has deficient stock?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",172
"173","—Yes.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",173
"174","21295. But you think the thing is more or less improving itself now?",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",174
"175","—Yes, it is very largely.",371,"Rev James Fraser","Shetland, Hillswick",175
