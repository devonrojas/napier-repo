"1","DONALD BEATON, Crofter, Earlish (74)—examined. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",1
"2","1725. The Chairman.",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",2
"3","—Were you freely elected to be a delegate here?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",3
"4","—Yes. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",4
"5","1726. Will you be so good as to state what are the complaints of the people at Earlish?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",5
"6","—That the rent is so heavy that we cannot live on the land, and we have to go everywhere to earn money to support us. I have here a receipt for the rent I was paying in 1852 and a receipt for the rent just now. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",6
"7","1727. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",7
"8","—The same lands?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",8
"9","—The same lands. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",9
"10","1728. The Chairman.",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",10
"11","—Is that half a year's rent or a full year's rent?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",11
"12","— A full year's rent. In 1852 it was £3, 17s. 8d ; and in 1880 the rent was £9; poor rate, 9s. 9d.; school rate, 6s.; roads, 3s.; interest, 2s. 3d.; in all, £10, 1s. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",12
"13","1729. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",13
"14","—Have you not got a reduction on that £9?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",14
"15","—Yes, I got a reduction of £1 last year. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",15
"16","1730. Besides the rates?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",16
"17","—The £3 includes rates and taxes. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",17
"18","1731. Do you know what the rent was without the rates and taxes?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",18
"19","— I cannot say, but that is the amount of the rent with the rates. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",19
"20","1732. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",20
"21","—Did you pay any rates or taxes in 1852 ?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",21
"22","—No, not at that time. I paid no rates and taxes in addition to the £.3, 17s. 8d. We cannot live paying our present rent with two cows. If I had five followers from them this year I would have none next year, the place is so bad, There is no feeding for them. I have only two of a family now, and it is more than a year since my family or I ate any produce of our soil,—buying everything from the merchant, even seed. We got seed this year from the landlord. We got 4 bushels of seed oats this year, and a barrel of potatoes, from the landlord, and we will have to pay it back. We wish to have as much of the land as would keep us alive and would enable us to pay the landlord, instead of going from country to country as slaves. There is plenty land in the Isle of Skye, if we could only get it, which would support double the population. We have only got the remnants of the land which the tacksmen have,—remnants which the tacksmen would not take. The laud is very bad and very thin,—very shallow. My holding is very poor indeed when I cannot support three of us out of it. As to the rent, we have not the promise that the reduction shall continue. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",22
"23","1733. Mr Cameron.",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",23
"24","—Where would you like to get other land to add to your farm ?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",24
"25","—Any place where I would get it. Is there not land all about us,—big tacks ? ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",25
"26","1734 Mention one ?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",26
"27","—The nearest tack is Cuiderach, next to Kingsburgh. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",27
"28","1735. Would you be able to pay for the stock if you got those lands?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",28
"29","— No. I have two cows and two two-year-old's, and a stirk, and none of them belong to myself. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",29
"30","1736. Where do you propose to raise money to pay for the stock that would be necessary to put upon this new farm ?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",30
"31","—From the charitable gentlemen outside of the island of Skye,—and perhaps they may be present here to-day,—who are sending money to help Skye people; and perhaps we might be able to get money till the place would enable us to repay it. There are people among us who are as willing to repay any such advances, and their honest debts, as can be. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",31
"32","1737. Have you heard that in the rest of the Isle of Skye there are similar complaints, and that the crofters want more land ?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",32
"33","—I do not know, but I know that we have such a complaint among ourselves. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",33
"34","1738. What is the rate of wages in your district?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",34
"35","—No wages unless it be 1s. 6d. a day, between that and 2s. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",35
"36","1739. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",36
"37","—What are the men getting who are employed on the roads?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",37
"38","—I do not know. I do not think they are getting much. There are very few men working on the roads. I have been going to Kintyre for the past ten years, remaining there at work until winter time, while the work is to be done, and when my spring work is over I expect to leave the country again this year. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",38
"39","1740. The Chairman.",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",39
"40","—How much does it cost you to go to Kintyre, and how much to come back?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",40
"41","—£1 going and £1 returning; and the gentleman was giving my companions and myself 35s. each to meet the ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",41
"42","expense. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",42
"43","1741. How much do you get per day while you are there?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",43
"44","—2s. 6d. a day, and lodging, but we have to feed ourselves. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",44
"45","1742. Professor Mackinnon.",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",45
"46","—How many crofters are there in Earlish?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",46
"47","—Twenty lots, and two of the lots have two families each. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",47
"48","1743. What stock are they allowed to keep?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",48
"49","—The summing of the croft is three cows, ten sheep, and a horse, but I have only seven sheep. I have a horse. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",49
"50","1744. The rent in 1852 was £3, 17s. 8d., and two years ago £9. How often was it raised?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",50
"51","—Three times. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",51
"52","1745. Was that all during the present proprietor's time?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",52
"53","—Yes. I believe we have been paying rent more than a hundred years. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",53
"54","1746. At what date was the rent raised, before the present proprietor came?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",54
"55","—I do not know that there was any rise in the rent previous to the time of the present proprietor. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",55
"56","1747. What was the rent in your earliest recollection?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",56
"57","—The same rent for which I have produced a receipt. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",57
"58","1748. Your complaint is that the croft is too small and the rent too high?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",58
"59","—Yes. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",59
"60","1749. You say that the reduction which was given last year is not promised for the future ?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",60
"61","—It may be continued, but no promise has been made. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",61
"62","1750. What reason was given for making the reduction?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",62
"63","—That the landlord saw, the rent was too high, I suppose. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",63
"64","1751. Was it because the times were bad?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",64
"65","—Partly owing to the badness of the times. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",65
"66","1752. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",66
"67","—You said there were twenty crofts, and two crofts had double families. How many crofters were there when you first recollect ?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",67
"68","—Twenty,—the same number; but in times past it was four, and then the ground was cut into lots. My father got one of these original lots, and I succeeded him in the lot. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",68
"69","1753. Your father was a sub-tenant of the four who held it originally?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",69
"70","—He was not one of the four; he was one of the twenty who got the subdivision of the four. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",70
"71","1754. But these twenty were living on the land at the time, though they had not a share ?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",71
"72","—They were taken from other places. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",72
"73","1755. Where was your father before he came to Earlish?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",73
"74","—At Keistle. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",74
"75","1756. Professor Mackinnon.",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",75
"76","—Since the lots were subdivided in that way have the marches of the arable land aud of the pasture land remained the same ?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",76
"77","—The same marches. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",77
"78","1757. Both arable land and pasture land?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",78
"79","—Yes. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",79
"80","1758. There was no pasture land taken away?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",80
"81","—A piece of the hill pasture was taken from us, but it was added to another township which was as needy as we were, where there were crofters. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",81
"82","1759. It was not added to a big tack?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",82
"83","—No. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",83
"84","1760. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",84
"85","—What was the date when this division took place ?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",85
"86","—I was not born when that was done. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",86
"87","1761. And the lands are not smaller now than they were then?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",87
"88","—No. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",88
"89","1762. And the people are not more numerous?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",89
"90","—No,but there are poor among us who have not got land at all. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",90
"91","1763. How many of these are there?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",91
"92","—A good number. There are seven. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",92
"93","1764. Were they born in the place, or did they come from outside ?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",93
"94","— They were not all born in Earlish. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",94
"95","1765. Have they gone there with the proprietor's leave or without it?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",95
"96","—It was with the proprietor's leave that some of them came from Uig. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",96
"97","1766. Does it help to impoverish the place that those people should be settled there?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",97
"98","—The township is not at all the better of it. Though we are paying poor rates, those poor people are coming about the houses the same as before. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",98
"99","1767. You said the land was very thin, shallow, and bad. Has anything been done to deepen the land in the way of trenching ?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",99
"100","—Those of the tenants who had wet land were draining it, and we are taking the sand from the knolls and spreading it where the soil is shallower. My son and myself were working the whole of last winter at that work, and doing a little of it every year. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",100
"101","1768. Do you lime the land?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",101
"102","—No, we cannot get it. There is not limestone on the place. In Lord Macdonald's time there were several lots that were cheaper than mine. ",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",102
"103","1769. Have they been all raised?",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",103
"104","—They were all raised the same as mine was in Captain Fraser's time.",28,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",104
