"1","DONALD ROSS, Crofter, Idrigill (68)—examined. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",1
"2","1770. The Chairman.",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected a delegate of the people of Idrigill?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",3
"4","—Yes.",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",4
"5","1771. You have a statement to read to the Commissioners?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",5
"6","—Yes. At a meeting of crofters at Idrigill, on 7th May 1883,—William Campbell in the chair,—the following resolution was agreed to :—That it is absolutely necessary that additional land should be given to each crofter in order to enable him to live, as our present holdings are utterly inadequate to support us for two months in a favourable year. Our existence depends on the immediate enlargement of our crofts. We also feel it to be a great grievance that we are prevented by the smallness of our crofts from keeping a horse to help us with the tillage, as it is laborious and even degrading for our women and men to have to carry all manure and seaware on their backs. The want of hill grazing is very much felt by us in various ways. First the want of hill grazing prevents us from keeping some sheep. The result of that prevention is that many of us have no better bed clothes than old bags formerly used in conveying whelks to Glasgow. We also desire to bring under the notice of the Commission that we are under the necessity of keeping a herd to keep away the sheep of neighbouring tacks, which often do damage to our little crops. We dare not complain for fear of eviction. The sea-ware on our foreshores is not sufficient for the manuring our several crofts. We often have to go to the outlying tenantless islands to cut sea-ware. The proprietor Captain M'Donald, Waternish, prohibits us from doing so. We arethirty-seven families in Idrigill. For many years back we often have to go to the banks for our rents, and to other money lenders, so that our present debts are nearly £700. Our credit with but few exceptions is gone. We welcome the Commission, and these our truthful grievances we leave with confidence in their hands.",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",6
"7","1772. Do you wish to add anything to that statement?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",7
"8","—Not much further than what is expressed in the paper. We want more land, to pay a rent. The land we have is too small. We cannot support our families on it. We have just about two and a half acres each. We have a cow and a stirk, but no sheep and no horse. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",8
"9","1773. What is the rent ?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",9
"10","—Our rent is £4 and a few pence. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",10
"11","1774. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",11
"12","—Does that include the rates ?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",12
"13","—Inclusive of rates. It used to be £5 , until the last reduction. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",13
"14","1775. Mr Cameron.",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",14
"15","—Do they all pay the same ?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",15

"17","1776. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",17
"18","—Is it paid, or mostly in arrear ?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",18
"19","—Some of us are in arrear. Some of them had to use the money in buying food. The summing is one cow, one stirk, no sheep, no horse. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",19
"20","1777. The Chairman.",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",20
"21","—No hill pasture?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",21

"26","1779. The Chairman.",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",26
"27","—How much arable land ?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",27
"28","—About two and a half acres. We go to Waternish to get sea-ware, but the proprietor forbids us, ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",28
"29","1780. How much was the rent at the earliest period you recollect ?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",29
"30","— £2, 17s. 6d. Then, by act of Government, we made drains, and Is. 6d. was laid upon our crofts for drainage interest.",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",30
"31","1781. That is, Is. 6d. in the pound?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",31
"32","—It was Is. 6d. on the whole sum that was expended on the drains. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",32
"33","1782. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",33
"34","—Then what next?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",34
"35","—The rents were raised three times. It was in three successive rises raised to £5 , and it was reduced to what we now pay two years ago. I cannot remember each step of the rise.",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",35
"36","1783. Mr Cameron.",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",36
"37","—Over how many years did the rises extend ?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",37

"40","—Do you get the benefit of the doctor in your rent now ?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",40
"41","—We pay the doctor's money along with the rent. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",41
"42","1785. Does the £4 cover the doctor?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",42
"43","—Yes. This last reduction that took effect two years ago is not promised to continue. We are still charged the old rent, and the reduction is credited to the amount. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",43
"44","1786. Mr Cameron.",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",44
"45","—What do you mean by credited?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",45
"46","—The reduction is not permanent. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",46
"47","1787. Do you expect it to be treated next year as arrears, or do you expect it to be permanent ?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",47
"48","—We do not know. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",48
"49","1788. Do you expect the reduction of this year—the odd £1—will be asked for next year ?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",49
"50","—We do not expect the actual reduction made during the past two years will be asked from us again. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",50
"51","1789. The Chairman.",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",51
"52","—Have you any other remark to make before you retire ?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",52

"54","1790. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",54
"55","—How do you live?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",55
"56","—On credit; and now those who have been supplying us with credit cannot supply it any further. Their own credit is gone. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",56
"57","1791. But you have got 2½ acres, and that does not occupy you all the year. Surely you do something else for a living?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",57
"58","—When we are able we go to work for wages, but I am now getting too old for that. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",58

"75","1800. Do you sell a stirk most years?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",75
"76","—Not every year. The year we would have a stirk to seU we sold it, and the year we had not we just went deeper into debt. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",76
"77","1801. How much food do you get off the croft? How long will it keep you ?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",77
"78","—If potatoes were growing as they used to grow, they would keep us four or five months ; but the potatoes do not grow with us now,—the land has got exhausted. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",78

"82","—Yes. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",82
"83","1804. Did it do no good ?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",83
"84","—For a time that did good. They have got deteriorated since then. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",84
"85","1805. Then, if the croft keeps you for four months in the year, you have to live upon £9 for the other eight months",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",85
"86","—Yes, but the year we have not potatoes good it would not keep us alive for that length of time. ",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",86
"87","1806. Have you any family to help you ?",29,"Donald Ross","Skye, Uig",87
