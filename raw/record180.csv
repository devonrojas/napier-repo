"1","THOMAS Ross, Fish Curer, Burghead, Morayshire (57)—examined.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",1
"2","10586. The Chairman.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",2
"3","Have you any statement to make to us?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",3
"4","—Yes. In regard to telegraphic communication, I beg leave to say that we stand much in need of some more facilities.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",4
"5","10587. Will you explain what the object or purpose of it principally is—to notify where and what ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",5
"6","—Looking to the number of boats and curers we have got here, we have very bad facilities for doing business as regards postal or telegraphic communication. For instance, if we were sending away a telegram from here to-day, it would not be at Loch Boisdale for two days, going by the regular postal boat across the sound. If we had the telegraph on to Castle Bay it would be a great facility for the fish curing interest.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",6
"7","10588. Where is the nearest telegraphic point?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",7
"8","—At Loch Boisdale, I understand.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",8
"9","10589. Then you wish it to be brought on from that place to Castle Bay?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",9
"10","—Yes.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",10
"11","10590. Would it be submarine the whole way ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",11
"12","—No, about six or eight miles.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",12
"13","10591. And that would be very useful to you in the transaction of your business ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",13
"14","—Yes, very much so.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",14
"15","10592. With reference to the announcement that you had so much fish to despatch, or for what purpose?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",15
"16","—In the first place, we require to take all our fish curing utensils, stock, and salt from home. We only take out part at the first of the season, and then according to the success of the fishing we have to seud home for additional supplies. We have no communication to let them know what we require, without facilities. As regards salt, we take perhaps fifty or one hundred barrels per boat, and that may be consumed in a very short time. If we had telegraphic communication, we could send home for it, and have a vessel despatched immediately, giving us a supply in a very few days. Another thing is, that we would have communication with our continental markets, to see what market would suit us best. It takes about six days for a letter to come from our quarter to here, and it will take three days for a telegram. I had one lately which was five days on the way.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",16
"17","10593. What are your principal continental markets?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",17
"18","—Hamburg, Stettin, Danzic, Konigsberg, St Petersburg.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",18
"19","10594. They are all in the North Sea or in the Baltic?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",19
"20","—Yes. Then we have about 350 boats between here and Vatersay fishing at this moment, and these 350 boats are valued at £400 a boat.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",20
"21","10595. Including nets?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",21
"22","—Nets and boat. I understand that is a low calculation.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",22
"23","10596. What is the average tonnage of these good boats?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",23
"24","—I suppose it may be about twenty-five tons.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",24
"25","10597. And you think that one of these good boats all found is worth about £400?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",25
"26","—On an average, including the nets. Now each of these boats coming here would wire home on their arrival—350 boats—and also previous to their leaving, which would be some consideration to the telegraphic department. Then we take out about two women to each boat —some have one and some have two—and these women would be telegraphing home, and we have a cooper for every two or three boats, and there are thirty-three curers in Castle Bay and twelve in Vatersay. The amount of telegraphing which they would have would be something considerable.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",26
"27","10598. Are most of the women brought from the east coast, or are most of them found on the island? —Most of them on the island.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",27
"28","10599. What number of women are generally brought from the east coast ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",28
"29","—I could scarcely say, but an average of one or two per boat.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",29
"30","10600. Do they come round with the boats?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",30
"31","—Some come round with the boats, and some come by Oban.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",31
"32","10601. Do the women generally belong to the families of the men who come with the boats, or are they hired?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",32
"33","—Well, they are hired, but they generally belong to the men as a rule.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",33
"34","10602. How long does it take for the boats to come round when they come round the north of Scotland ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",34
"35","—They come round by the Pentland Firth in two or three days. I believe three days is considered a good",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",35
"36","passage. Coming through the canal, they take four or five days.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",36
"37","10603. Mr Cameron,",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",37
"38","Which way do most of them come ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",38
"39","—By the canal.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",39
"40","10604. The Chairman.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",40
"41","Is the use of the canal increasing?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",41
"42","—I really cannot say for that.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",42
"43","10605. Have you made any application to the postmaster-general about this matter?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",43
"44","—We petitioned the postmaster-geueral three times since I came here first. This is my fifteenth season in Castle Bay, and during that time we have petitioned the postmaster-general three times.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",44
"45","10606. Was that for postal communication?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",45
"46","—No, for telegraphic communication.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",46
"47","10607. What answer did you get?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",47
"48","—-They were to take it into consideration. Last year we had 490 boats between here and Vatersay, but",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",48
"49","owing to the failure of the fishing last year the number of boats has been reduced, but we have hopes of a good supply this year.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",49
"50","10608. Do you pay a great amount in wages?—As regards the women we take out from home, we generally allow them so much during the season —£3, £3, 10s. or £1. The women on the island receive £1 of earnest, and what they can make per barrel—eightpence per barrel. ",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",50
"51","10609. And they realise about the same amount?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",51
"52","—If the fishing is good they will realise about £ 3 or 50s. on an average.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",52
"53","10610. How many men are employed in the business?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",53
"54","—Each boat has about six men.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",54
"55","10611. To what extent are they paid by you?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",55
"56","—We do not pay these men. We only pay according to their fishing, so much per cran.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",56
"57","10612. You do pay the men so much per cran?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",57
"58","—We pay the skipper of the boat, and he generally has one or two or three fishing along with him. The crew is generally made up by four men from home.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",58
"59","10613. Then there are men employed on the beach?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",59
"60","—The coopers.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",60
"61","10614. Are there any men actually employed in preparing the fish?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",61
"62","—That is all done by women.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",62
"63","10615. Where do you get the casks?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",63
"64","—We make them all at home on the east coast.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",64
"65","10616. Where does the wood come from, the staves and hoops?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",65
"66","—We get it round our own district principally, and some from Norway. There is not much comiug into our district to speak of from Norway, but Aberdeen, Peterhead, and Fraserburgh are greatly supplied from Norway. ",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",66
"67","10617. What are the barrels made of?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",67
"68","—Some fir and some larch. These are the two principal qualities. Larch is preferable.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",68
"69","10618. In your transactions with the women or the men whom you employ, do you ever pay in goods, or do you always pay in money ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",69
"70","—All cash. We deal in no goods.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",70
"71","10619. There is no truck system of any description in your hands ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",71
"72","—Nothing whatever.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",72
"73","10620. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",73
"74","Do you think the fishing here is capable of being developed ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",74
"75","—Perfectly so.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",75
"76","10621. How long do you remain here each year?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",76
"77","—Generally about seven or eight weeks. We arrive about the first days of May and our time is out on the 23rd of June. Then we have our fish to prepare after the boats leave.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",77
"78","10622. What is the usual fishing time?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",78
"79","—Generally from the 15th or 20th of May to the 23rd of June. If we have fish when the boat's time is out, we have the fish to prepare afterwards, and to see them shipped, so we calculate upon being on the island for about eight weeks.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",79
"80","10623. Do you know if there is any fishing of any kind during the rest of the year ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",80
"81","—Yes.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",81
"82","10624. What kind?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",82
"83","—Ling is the principal fishing, I believe.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",83
"84","10625. Is it a good station for the ling fishing?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",84
"85","—I understand so. I do not do anything in it myself, but I understand it is a good station for ling. I believe there are great quantities caught at times.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",85
"86","10626. Is it a good fishing station to keep the fishermen employed all the year round ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",86
"87","—I understand it is.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",87
"88","10627. But of your own knowledge you do not know?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",88
"89","—Not of my own experience, because I never did anything in that line. I understand they do a great deal here with lobsters. Now, taking into consideration 350 boats at eighty crans per boat on the average—we are bound to take one hundred and fifty per boat, but average it at eighty crans—it comes to about £70,000. The fish cost us about £2 per cran. After paying bounty money and all other expenses, I average them at £2,10s. per barrel, and taking eighty craus per boat, it comes to about £70,000. It is a good amount of money that we have at stake. Then we take out one hundred and fifty barrels per boat, and I value these at five shillings per barrel, which comes to £ 37, 10s ; salt, £ 10 per boa t ; bounty money to each boat, £50, coopers' labour and women's labour per boat, £ 20 ;—in all, £117,10s.When these things are taken into account I think we are justified in advocating telegraphic communication as much as possible.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",89
"90","10628. What is the bounty ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",90
"91","— £ 50. I pay that, and many others I know pay the same.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",91
"92","10629. What is the nature of the payment?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",92
"93","—When we engage these boats to go and fish for us, we give them so much per cran and £ 50 of bounty money. This bounty is just given as a compliment; we do not receive any benefit if we do not receive fish.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",93
"94","10630. It is a sum to secure their services?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",94
"95","—Yes, and they have £ 1 or £ 2 earnest money after that. I pay £ 50 of bounty money and £ 2 of",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",95
"96","earnest to each boat.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",96
"97","10631. When do they receive that £50?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",97
"98","—Immediately on our arrival home.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",98
"99","10632. Do you arrange the prices before you leave home?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",99
"100","—Perhaps six months before we leave home.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",100
"101","10633. What prices do you give?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",101
"102","—Some fifteen or sixteen shillings per cran for about a week at the beginning—from the 15th to the 23rd or 24th of May—and then twenty shillings all over. Some do not commence to take their fish till the 20th of May.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",102
"103","10634. You do not settle with them till they are home?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",103
"104","—We give them so much to pay expenses, and settle with them immediately after arrival home.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",104
"105","10635. Is the price the same every year?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",105
"106","—No, it varies. The bounty money is the same every year.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",106
"107","10636. That is to say, there is sometimes more competition to secure men?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",107
"108","—Yes, and according to the fishing. Last year men were not willing to come out without a higher bounty.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",108
"109","10637. Mr Cameron.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",109
"110","Besides the reasons you have given for requiring additional telegraphic facilities here, is it the case that you would be very much better off if you had better means of communicating with steamers to come and fetch away the fish when there are more fish brought in at one time than at another ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",110
"111","—Yes, that is very much required.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",111
"112","10638. You wish to telegraph that there is an extra supply of fish, so as to get it away rapidly ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",112
"113","—Yes.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",113
"114","10639. I suppose that not having this telegraphic communication, you feel yourselves placed at a considerable disadvantage as compared with those on the east coast, who have these advantages ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",114
"115","—Very much so. We can do no business in a manner without being prepared at once with all we get We made a great preparation last year at the commencement of the season to see what the result was, and I suppose the average of each boat did not come to £10. My own average was six crans. ",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",115
"116","10640. And you think that in fairness you should be placed upon an equality with the curers on the east coast?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",116
"117","—Yes.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",117
"118","10641. In any replies which you have had from the postmaster-general has he ever alluded to the cost of laying down a wire between here and Loch Boisdale ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",118
"119","—Not to our petition, but I believe that was done to the proprietor.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",119
"120","10642. Did you happen to hear what that cost was stated at?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",120
"121","—No, I did not.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",121
"122","10643. Did you hear that one reason was on account of the tides and the difficulty of laying down the wire in the sea, because the tides were so strong ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",122
"123","—I did hear that.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",123
"124","10644. Do you think that might be overcome?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",124
"125","—Yes; it is only in that one sound. The breadth is six or seven miles.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",125
"126","10645. Do you know who has been surveying the ground?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",126
"127","—No.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",127
"128","10646. I suppose there are other places in the United Kingdom where telegraphic cables are laid now under similar difficulties ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",128
"129","—More so, I thiuk.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",129
"130","10647. Are you aware there was a select committee of the House of Commons sitting last year on the subject of fisheries, and especially as to what purpose the surplus fund derived from the herring brand should be devoted ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",130
"131","—Yes.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",131
"132","10648. Was there a Mr Ferguson examined before that committee from Loch Boisdale ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",132
"133","—Yes.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",133
"134","10649. Are you aware that iu the report of that committee it was recommended that this place, Barra, being without telegraphic communication, was a very great source of hardship and injury to the fishing interest ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",134
"135","—Yes.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",135
"136","10650. And they recommended Parliament to find the money for the purpose of supplying the deficiency? —Yes.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",136
"137","10651. So I hope you feel encouraged in persevering in your attempts by that fact ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",137
"138","—Yes. I hope and have confidence that it will be here if I come back next year.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",138
"139","10652. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",139
"140","The local requirements would not need the telegraph; it is only the fishing?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",140
"141","—I would not say, but there are some gentlemen here who would require the telegraph as well as we do.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",141
"142","10653. But that is of comparatively minor importance?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",142
"143","—Yes.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",143
"144","10654. Are you aware that the post-office, when applications are made to them for extensions such as this, are always willing to do it if a guarantee is made that they will have a certain return for their outlay ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",144
"145","—Yes.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",145
"146","10655. Do you know whether any sum has ever been stated that would pay the post-office, under which they would give this line?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",146
"147","—No, I never heard the sum stated, but I have heard that Lady Gordon Cathcart offered so much as a guarantee.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",147
"148","10656. I suppose the fish curers and others would not be disposed to do more than use the wire considerably?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",148
"149","—Well, I don't know about that. I heard it talked of here not long ago that they would be willing to do",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",149
"150","something before they would want it.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",150
"151","10657. Do you think that is the general idea among your colleagues and others in business—that they would do this ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",151
"152","—I really do think so.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",152
"153","10658. Can you give us any idea how much money will be left in this locality by each boat during the six weeks of the year ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",153
"154","—I should say there would be from £600 to £700 altogether for women alone.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",154
"155","10659. I presume that most of your supplies you bring with you?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",155
"156","—Yes, but there is a good deal of money spent here in groceries forbye what we take out.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",156
"157","10660. By the crews of the boats?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",157
"158","—By the crews and fish curers and women.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",158
"159","10661. Then how much do you put it at altogether? You have mentioned a sum for women; would you double that for men during the six weeks ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",159
"160","—Yes. There are a good many men engaged here for the boats. Some boats have one man and some two men belonging to the island, who receive from £5 to £7 each, and they have their meat during the time",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",160
"161","provided by the owners of the boat.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",161
"162","10662. So you would run the amount up to £1500?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",162
"163","—Yes, I am bound to say that all that money is left behind. I know, since I came to this island first of all, a great deal of difference in the appearance of the people. I think they are getting better.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",163
"164","10663. What interest has the proprietrix, Lady Gordon Cathcart, in giving a guarantee ? Do you pay her any rent?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",164
"165","—Yes",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",165
"166","10664- In which form? ",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",166
"167","—We pay £5 each to Lady Gordon Cathcart for the ground we occupy to cure the fish on.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",167
"168","10665. How many curers are there?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",168
"169","—There are thirty-three in Castle Bay and twelve in Yatersay—forty-five altogether. Each of these pays £5",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",169
"170","for his ground.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",170
"171","10666. Is that the only benefit she receives ?—No. After that we pay seven shillings and sixpence for each boat for spreading the nets to dry. Each boat has to pay that, use it or not use it.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",171
"172","10667. One of the delegates complained that it is taken from them?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",172
"173","—We pay it to the factor.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",173
"174","10668. But you take it off the men?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",174
"175","—Yes, just according to bargain. Some do not. But we have to pay that seven shillings and sixpence for",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",175
"176","each boat in the loch, spread or not spread our nets.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",176
"177","10669. That is £5 per curer and seven shillings and sixpence per boat?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",177
"178","—Yes.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",178
"179","10670. As regards your provisions, do you try to bring everything you can with you ?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",179
"180","—Yes. There is one thing we are very much at a loss for here, namely, butcher meat. We have to take it all from home.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",180
"181","10671. Can you get plenty milk?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",181
"182","—I sometimes have a privilege from Dr Macgillivray, who sends me a jar now and then, which is the only",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",182
"183","milk I see.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",183
"184","10672. Fresh butter?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",184
"185","—No.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",185
"186","10673. Eggs?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",186
"187","—Plenty; any amount of eggs.",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",187
"188","10674. That is the only thing the cottars can give you?",180,"Thomas Ross","Barra, Castlebay",188
