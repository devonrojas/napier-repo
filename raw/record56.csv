"1","NEIL M'DIARMID, Crofter, Geary (70)—examined ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",1
"2","3362. The Chairman.",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",2
"3","—How long have you been on your croft ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",3
"4","— Since I was born.",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",4
"5","3363. Have you been freely elected a delegate ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",5
"6","—Yes. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",6
"7","3364. What statement have you to make on the part of those whom you represent ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",7
"8","—I think that those who have preceded me have left little for me to say, but those who delegated me desired me to say in your presence that there are thirty-three crofts in Geary, and when our fathers had it there ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",8
"9","were twelve crofts. And they are complaining that they are without horses or sheep now. It cannot be that they could have sheep or horses when there are thirty-three tenants in Geary. Who will extend their holdings unless the landlord does it? If the landlord will not give them more room, so long as there are so many sheep tacks in Skye, the poor man will never get justice. Sheep do not improve the soil, but the people will. The land will run into heather and rushes under sheep. Instead of that the Land should be in the hands of the people who improve it. If the people do not get enlarged holdings, they will become poorer every day. (see Appendix A. VII)",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",9
"10","3365. I have to say, further, that in Geary some of the people have left for the south country, leaving the spring work unfinished, owing to their inability to procure food for their families, as their credit was gone. In regard to debts, I have to say that the landlord is very favourable to the people. He never yet put a man out of his possession for rent. Geary crofters can keep two cows aud a two-year-old, but the holdings would not support these, but for the landlord allowing the crofters a mouth or two grazing in spring on his own grounds. The first year that Captain Macdonald became our landlord he gave them a strip of hill pasture in addition to what they had, and did not charge them one shilling extra. This year, again, he gave them another strip. They would have to enclose it with a dyke, and they considered it too small for that. It is not the present proprietor who has done them any harm, but those who preceded him. As to the hill pasture, I need not say anything about it, as it was taken from us at the same time that those who before were deprived of it. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",10
"11","3366. Sheriff Nicolson.",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",11
"12","—Is there any restriction upon them as to the sale of their cattle? ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",12
"13","—I am not aware of anything of the sort. I did not experience anything of the sort. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",13
"14","3367. Do you know of any such thing' in Geary ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",14
"15","—I am not aware of that, and I have not seen him take vengeance on any one. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",15
"16","3368. Are they free to sell them to anybody?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",16
"17","—Yes, the ground officer gives the people an offer for the stock. If the people don't accept this offer, they are at liberty to sell to anybody else. If the landlord does not givo what another gives, the crofters are at liberty to sell them elsewhere. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",17
"18","3369. Does the ground officer offer for all the stock that is sold ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",18
"19","—It is for the stirks that he offers oftenest. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",19
"20","3370. Then he has the first offer always ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",20
"21","—Yes. That might be about the Whitsunday time. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",21
"22","3371. Are they much in arrears at Geary ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",22
"23","—Yes, I know that some are. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",23
"24","3372. How far are any of them in arrear?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",24
"25","—I know that some are in arrears to the extent of a full year's rent. The landlord said nothing to them about it.  ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",25
"26","3373. Is there any business done among the people here by bills, to raise money?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",26
"27","—No, not for him whatever. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",27
"28","3374. As to other matters, are they in debt generally to merchants for food and other things ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",28
"29","—Surely, they are. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",29
"30","3375. Have you any notion of the amount of debt there is in Geary just now ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",30
"31","—Can it bo without debt ? Hundreds of bolls have been brought to it not within the last year, but other years. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",31
"32","3376. Are there many of them in debt for the meal?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",32
"33","—Yes. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",33
"34","3377. Where do they get it generally ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",34
"35","—From Greenock. There is a man named M'Lean, a native of this island, in Greenock. The Geary people are often working in Greenock. The man knows some of them. When one is not acquainted with him, it is natural he will not be trusted. I am sure that that man has scores of pounds against Geary, for the produce of Geary won't feed the people half a year. And I believe there is not in the island of Skye any people who have made more work in trenching their ground than the Geary people have done. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",35
"36","3378. Have they done that at their own expense ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",36
"37","—Yes. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",37
"38","3379. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",38
"39","—You mentioned there were only twelve tenants formerly in Geary. How long ago is that ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",39
"40","—I think about sixty years ago. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",40
"41","3380. Where did the other twenty-one tenants come from ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",41
"42","—From about Waternish. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",42
"43","3381. Are they Geary people—born in the place?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",43
"44","—Some have come from this side of Waternish. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",44
"45","3382. Were the crofts or lots of land divided by the proprietor -without their consent?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",45
"46","—It was done with the people's consent. I am of opinion that if the arable land were cultivated on the ' run rig' system, Geary would not be so well off as it is, because it would not be tilled. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",46
"47","3383. What I want to know is how these twenty-one additional people got into Geary ? Was it by the wish of the tenants of Geary themselves at the time ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",47
"48","— When the west side of Waternish was cleared some of them, I believe, went to Geary. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",48
"49","3384. But who invited them there ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",49
"50","—I believe it was the proprietor. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",50
"51","3385. And the lands he gave them were held in occupation at the time by these crofters?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",51
"52","—Yes, and the hill also. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",52
"53","3386. Did these thirteen crofters voluntarily resign half of their lands for the sake of the people on the west side ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",53
"54","—I will not say they did. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",54
"55","3387. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",55
"56","—Are the people of Geary in poor circumstances ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",56
"57","—They are, as I have said. The land will no more than feed them for six months; and were it otherwise, there would not be so much meal coming to them from the south. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",57
"58","3388. Are they getting worse in their circumstances?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",58
"59","—Yes. The climate accounts largely for that. That is not the landlord's fault. It is the work of Providence. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",59
"60","3389. Are they falling back year by year. You know there are many years since the potato failure began ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",60
"61","—That put a number of them back. They are very close .at work earning their support. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",61
"62","3390. You said that tacksmen in Skye were not advantageous to the place, and that sheep allowed the pasture to deteriorate, and that men ought to be allowed to cultivate it ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",62
"63","—I am sure of that ? ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",63
"64","3391. But it appears there are no tacksmen upon Waternish ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",64
"65","—No. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",65
"66","3392. Then how was it that the people of Waternish are so poor; where is the land that would support them ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",66
"67","—If it is not in Waternish, it is through the country. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",67
"68","3393. How much land has the proprietor in his own possession, apart from the farm surrounding his house ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",68
"69","—I cannot tell within a mile, but I can mention the townships. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",69
"70","3394. Those the proprietor occupies himself 1",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",70
"71","—Yes. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",71
"72","339.5. Mention them ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",72
"73","—Lower Hallistra, Trumpan, Unish, Ballabourach, Scorr. I do not remember any other township lands he has. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",73
"74","3396. Will you give us a rough estimate as near as you can of the number of arable acres, or of what once was arable, in all those townships you have enumerated ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",74
"75","—I will not try that ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",75
"76","3397. Is it big or little ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",76
"77","—It is big enough. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",77
"78","3398. Are the hill grounds attached to those different townships of considerable extent ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",78
"79","—If you were on board the steamer, you would see its extent from sea to sea. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",79
"80","3399. Can you give us any estimate of the number of heads of families (crofters) that at one period occupied those different townships you have enumerated as being in the natural possession of the proprietor ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",80
"81","—I do not know, but I think there were over eighteen families in Unish. I think Trumpan was in the occupancy of a tacksman at one time. I think there were four in Ballabourach. I don't know but there were eighteen latterly in Scorr, and I think there were ten in Lower Hallistra. (see Appendix A. VII)",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",81
"82","3400. Were all the clearances of those places made at one time ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",82
"83","—I think they were. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",83
"84","3401. Who was proprietor then?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",84
"85","—I think it was the major, the present proprietor's father. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",85
"86","3402. One of the witnesses said that the removals went back to the time of the Grants ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",86
"87","—There were clearances by Corry, but I don't think they cleared these two townships. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",87
"88","3403. One of the witnesses said the factors came, and did certain mischief ; who were they factors for ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",88
"89","—I think, for Grant. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",89
"90","3404. Were there more factors than M'Kinnon of Corry whom you could name as accessory to these removals ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",90
"91","—I do not remember. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",91
"92","3405. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",92
"93","—We have had a crofter from Lower Hallistra, who spoke of Lower Hallistra being occupied. Is there a mistake about the name, or are there still crofters living about Lower Hallistra? There are people below the road yet, in Lower Hallistra. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",93
"94","3406. Professor Mackinnon.",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",94
"95","—But, above the road?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",95
"96","—Above the road is cleared. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",96
"97","3407. Mr Cameron.",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",97
"98","—What rent do you pay?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",98
"99","—Over £3. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",99
"100","3408. What stock have you got?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",100
"101","—My summing is two cows and a two year-old. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",101
"102","3409. And there is no hill pasture ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",102
"103","—No. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",103
"104","3410. You say you have done some trenching—some improvement in your township? Have the people derived any profit from that improvement ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",104
"105","—Yes, they got benefit from that. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",105
"106","3411. Have most of your neighbours improved the land ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",106
"107","—I understand that the most of my neighbours improved their holdings the same way, and I am now taking out of the ground twice what I used to do. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",107
"108","3412. Is there any more land remaining to be improved beyond what they have already done ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",108
"109","—No. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",109
"110","3413. They have improved it to the utmost extent?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",110
"111","—Yes. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",111
"112","3414. And what they want now is more hill pasture ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",112
"113","—Yes. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",113
"114","3415. Would they be satisfied if they got more hillpasture?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",114
"115","—They are complaining of the arable land also. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",115
"116","3416. You mean there is not enough of it?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",116
"117","—There is not enough of it. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",117
"118","3417. Is there any place where you can get more hill pasture in the neighbourhood ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",118
"119","—Just above us, and I don't know but the landlord may give us that. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",119
"120","3418. Have you ever asked him ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",120
"121","—Yes. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",121
"122","3419. What was the answer?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",122
"123","—We got a little strip this year, but it is not enough. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",123
"124","3420. Did you trench the ground with the common spade, or in what way ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",124
"125","—With the pick and spade. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",125
"126","3421. Do you get any work, either here or in the south, beyond what you have to do in your crofts ?-",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",126
"127","—A few might get a little more work here than they got to do in their crofts.  ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",127
"128","3422. There is work going on here to a certain extent?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",128
"129","—Such work as the landlord may give them. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",129
"130","3423. None besides ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",130
"131","—No. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",131
"132","3424. And in the south ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",132
"133","—Yes, every person that can goes to the south to work. They must do that, or they would starve at home. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",133
"134","3425. How long do they stay in the south ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",134
"135","—Till Christmas; plenty of those who left here a short time since. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",135
"136","3426. From when ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",136
"137","—From this week. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",137
"138","3427. What money do they bring home with them on an average?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",138
"139","— This year many came back from the east coast who did not get paid at alt. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",139
"140","3428. What were they doing on the east coast ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",140
"141","—Fishing. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",141
"142","3429. But I was talking about other work. Do they get any other work besides fishing ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",142
"143","—Yes. They get other work besides fishing out of the island.",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",143
"144","3430. And what do the people bring back ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",144
"145","—It cannot be much, between board and lodging—perhaps £ 7 or £8. It will give them enough to do by steady working to bring home £9 or £10. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",145
"146","3431. But, averaging the years, do you think they make more by fishing, or by working in the south ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",146
"147","—They do much better at the fishing when it succeeds with them. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",147
"148","3432. And which do they prefer?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",148
"149","—They prefer the fishing, because then chance is better. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",149
"150","3433. Do you think it would have answered the people better to have worked less land and been more in the way of getting wages in the south either by fishing or otherwise ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",150
"151","—I can say that they would not put an oar between rowlocks, and would not man a boat, and would not hoist a sail, if they were dependent upon all the fishing they got here through the year. As for the Geary people, unless they catch herring, no other fishing will be of any use to them, for the ling fishing is very scanty. The year in which the herring take is most plentiful, it will not last them much past winter. They may then take their long lines ashore. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",151
"152","3434. If you got better boats and tackle, do you think you could do more in the way of fishing ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",152
"153","—I cannot say. I think they have boats that will serve the purpose out here, for on this side they catch ling. A few ling can be caught here through the year. There are no piers and no place of refuge. What would they do with the boat when they could not draw it up? ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",153
"154","3435. But if they had better boats and a pier?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",154
"155","—I cannot say much about that. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",155
"156","3436. Are the people about here disposed to fishing, or do they generally dislike it, and would they rather stick to the land ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",156
"157","—Yes, they do like it; and in evidence of that, they are very often at Barra and the east coast. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",157
"158","3437. And if they saw an opportunity of prosecuting it more successfully they might make more money by it ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",158
"159","—Yes, they would. The fishing is very good if successful. The fishing would need to be very good before it would pay for sufficient fishing tackle and fishing material in this place. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",159
"160","3438. Sheriff Nicolson.",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",160
"161","—Have you a pier at Geary ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",161
"162","—Not a pier. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",162
"163","3439. Is there something like a pier at Scorhoren ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",163
"164","—Yes, there was, ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",164
"165","but it has long since fallen into decay. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",165
"166","3440. Would it encourage them to fish if they had a good pier there ? ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",166
"167","—Yes. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",167
"168","3441. Mr Cameron.",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",168
"169","—Has the poverty of the people dated from the period when there were thirty-three crofts, or is it a more recent production?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",169
"170","— The poverty of the crofters commenced with the thirty-one families in Geary, for every crofter had four or five cows and a horse and twenty sheep or so. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",170
"171","3442. But that was a long time ago ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",171
"172","—Yes. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",172
"173","3443. Has the poverty been severe ever since then?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",173
"174","—Poverty was increasing ever since the potatoes began to fad at first ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",174
"175","3444. Has it not increased in a greater proportion of late years ?-",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",175
"176","—Yes. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",176
"177","3445. Professor Mackinnon.",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",177
"178","—Were you born at Geary ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",178
"179","—Yes. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",179
"180","3446. Were your people one of the twelve families that had it ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",180
"181","—Yes. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",181
"182","3447. How old were you before these other people came in ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",182
"183","—I was very young at the time. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",183
"184","3448. Do you remember the time ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",184
"185","—Yes. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",185
"186","3449. And do you remember that the twelve who were there before you were pretty well off ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",186
"187","—Yes. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",187
"188","3450 I think you said they had a hill which they lost ?_That is true near enough. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",188
"189","3451. So that the twelve had a hill more than what the thirty-three have now ? They lost the hill they had, and other people were thrown in upon them as well ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",189
"190","—That is true; they had more than that. They had the island—the island of Geary —at that time. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",190

"196","—It is doubled to-day. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",196

"202","—I cannot say, without assistance. ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",202

"210","—Would not that be better than buying twelve bolls of meal and more from the south ? ",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",210
"211","3462. But would they be able to take it up ?",56,"Neil Mcdiarmid","Skye, Waternish",211
