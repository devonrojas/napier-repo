"2","23703. The Chairman.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",2
"3","—What place are you a delegate for?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",3
"4","—For the district here. ",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",4
"5","23704. What statement have you got to make?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",5
"6","—I have chiefly my own statement to make and then that of some of the crofters around me. I am living in a small place of 12 acres, which was put up at my father's expense (the proprietors furnishing some slate, flag, and lime), at a nineteen years' lease. When that lease was up I was raised £2 of rent upon it. I had an agreement to get a valuation for the wood I put upon it, and at the expiry of the lease, when I went to make a new arrangementI was told to sink that valuation and I would get a fourteen years' lease and £2 of a rise, and 12 acres of hill pasture broken in by ourselves out of the heather.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",6
"7","23705. Your holding was a holding of wild ground and heather?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",7
"8","—Yes.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",8
"9","23706. And you got a nineteen years' lease and broke up the laud and improved it and built houses, for which you had some assistance from your proprietor?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",9
"10","—Yes.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",10
"11","23707. Had you the place for the first nineteen years at a very low rent? ",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",11
"12","—Yes.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",12
"13","23708. About how much was it?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",13
"14","—2s. 6d. an acre, for the hill is poor in its natural state until we broke it in ourselves.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",14
"15","23709. And when your father got the land for nineteen years at a low rent, was it with the understanding that, at the end of the lease, the rent might be raised?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",15
"16","—He did not think that; we did not think that.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",16
"17","23710. You did not think it would ever be raised?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",17
"18","—We did not think it would be raised at that time, after breaking it in and building the houses ourselves.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",18
"19","23711. Supposing you had got compensation for the houses that you had built, and for the improvements you had made on the land, would you then think that it was right and natural that the rent should be raised at the end of the nineteen years?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",19
"20","—Yes.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",20
"21","23712. What was the nature of the improvements you made on the land?  Did you put up any stone fences?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",21
"22","—No fencing, but merely an enclosure for our crop.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",22
"23","23713. Did you make any tile or stone drains?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",23
"24","—Very few; not very many at our own expense.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",24
"25","23714. Did you put on any lime?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",25
"26","—None.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",26
"27","23715. Did you trench deeply with the pick or spade?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",27
"28","—Very often that, and took a great quantity of stones out with the pick.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",28
"29","23716. If you had had your buildings fairly valued, and the improvements to the ground fairly valued, and had got that money you would not have thought it unreasonable that the rent should have been raised?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",29
"30","—Not at all, if I had got compensation for the improvements.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",30
"31","23717. How much was the rent raised?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",31
"32","—£2.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",32
"33","23718. And you got a new lease?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",33
"34","—I have no lease now; that was the arrangement, but I got no lease.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",34
"35","23719. And do you consider yourself secure to the end of the fourteen years?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",35
"36","—No, I do not.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",36
"37","23720. Why don't you get a written agreement?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",37
"38","—Because I would not; take it on those terms at that rise of rent. I thought it was unfair treatment to get a rise of rent and no compensation. They sink my valuation. I was told by the factor that, if I did not agree he would advertise my place and let it. I told him if that was the case I could not help it, but I would not agree to sink the valuation; but I would pay the rent for a year if I could not better myself.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",38
"39","23721. How long have you had it since then?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",39
"40","—I have paid twelve years' rent at the rise.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",40
"41","23722. And have you been making still further improvements?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",41
"42","—Well, I have been trying to cultivate the soil to the best of my ability; but it was all broken up before then.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",42
"43","23723. Are you working at your trade ?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",43
"44","—Yes, to the farmers round about.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",44
"45","23721. Do you get regular employment?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",45
"46","—Not very regular. I did proprietor's work for a good while, but it was withdrawn from me.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",46
"47","23725. Do you work by the hour or by the day?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",47
"48","—Partly by the hour and partly by the day.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",48
"49","23726. What wages do you receive by the hour?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",49

"51","23727. What was it when you began life?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",51
"52","—I suppose about 3d.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",52
"53","23728. It has only advanced Id an hour?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",53
"54","—Yes.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",54
"55","23729. Are other people in your place in the same situation?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",55
"56","—They are; they are bound to the kelp making. I am in no wise bound to that; but, on the same footing, every three parties along the line by me are bound.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",56
"57","23730. Your case is very much the same as that of those around you?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",57

"60","—Mr Armour said you would speak for the people at the south and east end of the island—what can you say for them?",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",60
"61","—I don't think I can say anything for them. It is chiefly sandy soil; but it is not sand I think. I am not very much acquainted with soil.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",61
"62","23732. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",406,"James Guthrie","Orkney, Sanday",62
