"1","DONALD MACNEILL, Crofter, Glenmore—examined. ",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",1
"2","459. The Chairman.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",2
"3","—How long have you been in possession of a croft?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",3
"4","—Since sixty years back.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",4
"5","460. What is the size and rental of the croft?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",5
"6","—It is a half croft. There are only seven crofters at present, and two of these perhaps have only a quarter of a croft.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",6
"7","461. What is the rental?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",7
"8","—£15 and some odds for each croft; and a half croft is £7, 10s.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",8
"9","462. During the period of sixty years during which you have had 3 croft has the rent been increased?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",9
"10","—Yes.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",10
"11","463. How often, and how much?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",11
"12","—Once lately by Mr Macdonald, Tormore; and he laid upon the Glenmore tenants heavier than in any other part of the parish, and, I believe, of the estate of Lord Macdonald.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",12
"13","464. How much ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",13
"14","—£2, 3s. on each croft.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",14
"15","465. What was your half croft before?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",15
"16","—£6, 10s.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",16
"17","466. And it has been increased to £7, 10s. ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",17
"18","—Yes, rather a little over it.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",18
"19","467. Besides the money rent, are there any services or obligations in labour or payment in kind ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",19
"20","—Nothing of the kind.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",20
"21","468. In former times was there any obligations of that kind ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",21
"22","—No.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",22
"23","469. Why was the rent increased from £6, 10s. to £7, 10s. ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",23
"24","—It was just the will of the factor or Lord Macdonald. I am not sure what was the origin of it",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",24
"25","470. Have you any lease ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",25
"26","—No, no lease.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",26
"27","471. Are there any leases used at all among the crofters?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",27
"28","—No ; I do not know of any.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",28
"29","472. Would you like to have a lease if it were offered to you ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",29
"30","—Well, I would prefer certainty and fixity of tenure, if a fair rent.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",30
"31","473. What stock do you keep ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",31
"32","—We are allowed to keep five cows",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",32
"33","474. How many sheep?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",33
"34","—About twenty-six or so in all.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",34
"35","475. How many acres of arable land?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",35
"36","—I cannot ascertain that, because the measurement was never properly made. But all that is arable of it might be from four to five acres.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",36
"37","476. Then do you think that £7, 10s. is an exorbitant rent for land carrying six cows and twenty-six sheep, and four or five acres of arable land ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",37
"38","—The only grievance on that is that we have not enough of arable land. ",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",38
"39","477. But that is no answer to my question. Do you consider a rent of £7, 10s. for five cows, twenty-six sheep, and four or five acres of arable land too great ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",39
"40","—I think it was dear enough at the old rent.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",40
"41","478. Is there any other particular hardship or grievance of which the people at the Glens complain?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",41
"42","—Of the crowding, which is a general grievance throughout Skye, and subdividing.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",42
"43","479. Mr Cameron.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",43
"44","—You said there were seven tenants ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",44
"45","—There were four families formerly, but now there are fifteen families. There are seven crofts for fifteen families.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",45
"46","480. And the crofts are divided into half crofts?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",46
"47","—Yes, and some into quarter crofts.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",47
"48","481. But taking the rest of Skye into consideration, is not five or six acres of arable land rather a considerable croft?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",48
"49","—It is too small, because it is continually turned, and unless it is continually turned we cannot feed our cattle in the winter; and it is a very mountainous place, not yielding crop; and another thing is, that we have no artificial manure unless we cart it from a long distance over very bad roads.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",49
"50","482. I suppose you could do very well with double the size of croft ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",50
"51","—I might say this, that if there were a wise legislation on the land question, certainly we would require more to be more comfortable.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",51
"52","483. You seem to be well calculated to give us some assistance in this matter. Perhaps you would indicate what legislation should be adopted in order to secure this desirable result?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",52
"53","—Just to make a minimum and maximum in the rental book.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",53
"54","484. But how would that give you more land ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",54
"55","—Certainly, there is plenty of land in Skye.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",55
"56","485. But is there plenty of land in Glenmore ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",56
"57","—No, there is not plenty in Glenmore, if we are overcrowded already with fifteen families instead of four.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",57
"58","486. You would like to have double the land, in fact ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",58
"59","—Yes, or treble the land.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",59
"60","487. At the same rate of rent ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",60
"61","—I said before, without the last advance made upon the rent.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",61
"62","488. But I suppose you will admit your case is by no means the worst case in Skye—there are far smaller holdings ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",62
"63","—I am quite aware of that.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",63
"64","489. And if this wise legislation takes place, it would affect other holdings than yours—yours will not come first ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",64
"65","—Well, most likely. What I say in regard to wise legislation—if there were such a thing taking place over Skye—is, that you would very soon get a very prosperous and populous tenantry in Skye, and they would swell the British army as in times past, and destitution and the cry of destitution would be for ever swept from our island; and besides, pauperism would be diminished, and the poor¬house of Portree might be converted into some manufacturing establishment,—there would be no more need for it,—and Mr M'Tavish of Inverness would never be called upon to serve edictal summonses in Skye.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",65
"66","490. Do many people in Skye enlist into the army ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",66
"67","—Very few indeed.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",67
"68","491. Why don't they enlist now ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",68
"69","—Because they are impoverished and sunk down, without any spirit of enterprise whatever.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",69
"70","492. But, there is a large population in Skye?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",70
"71","—Well, they have very much diminished, certainly.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",71
"72","493. But does it not appear to you that, if they are poor and do not find any other occupation, and are disposed for a military career, there is a military career open to them now ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",72
"73","—There is this idea amongst them—why should we fight for our kingdom when we see so much poverty, and neglect by our sovereign and legislators ? That is the idea which has sunk in the minds of Skyemen so very much.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",73
"74","494. Do you seriously think that if instead of having five acres and paying £6, 10s. you had treble the amount of land—that is, say, fifteen acres—and cows and sheep in proportion, that would induce men to go into the army ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",74
"75","—They would get populous in Skye, and there would be a rising generation, and why not at present as formerly ? I would think they would be just induced by the same spirit as in former times to help the country to swell the British army, as I said, to defend their country and their land.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",75
"76","495. Have not the crofters in Skye got very much subdivided of late years ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",76
"77","—I am not sure. They are subdivided now and again throughout Skye, but we are not, certainly, the worst.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",77
"78","496. But would there not be a much greater temptation to subdivide if the crofts were larger than they are now, and therefore would bear subdivision much better?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",78
"79","—Yes, certainly.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",79
"80","497. Would there not be rather a tendency to go on to subdivision again and restore the same state of things which there is now?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",80
"81","—But I think there is plenty of land for this generation and the generations to come, supposing they were multiplying ever so much.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",81
"82","498. And you don't care for the generation after that ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",82
"83","—Oh ! yes, it is the making provision for that generation that I am speaking just now, and not for my own.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",83
"84","499. The Chairman.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",84
"85","—How old are you ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",85
"86","—I am over sixty years. There is another grievance which we have to complain of—want of road— and I am glad Sheriff Nicolson is here. He went once to the Glens with the Rev. Mr Reid, Portree, and I met him on the top of the hill, and he asked why we had not good roads here, and I answered that we were rather behind the age for claiming what was our right.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",86
"87","500. Is there in the Glens any example of common pasture being taken away from the crofters ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",87
"88","—None. We are quite free from that.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",88
"89","501. Do you remember any case of evictions by the landlord—anybody violently removed from the occupancy ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",89
"90","—None, we give that credit to the factor and to the landlord, that they have never removed except one family which had run very deep into arrear, and that family was removed.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",90
"91","502. Then you do not complain distinctly of any particular grievance, except one rise of a rental in sixty years?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",91
"92","—One rise of rental and the road —and it is most astonishing how bad the road is. Indeed, there is not a road, but we have a footpath which we call a road. Animals are endangered every time and many times, and recently three parties lost their way on the hill and passed the houses, and unless they had heard the crow of a cock, I do not know but some of their lives might have been lost.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",92
"93","503. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",93
"94","—Do you pay road money ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",94
"95","—Yes, we do ; and this is what we claim—if we pay road money, why not get the same privileges as our neighbours in Skye. I think we are entitled to it, and in all places, except a very small fraction, they have access by sea and land, but we have neither.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",95
"96","504. Did you make any claim to the trustees ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",96
"97","—We made a claim two or three times to the local committee and twice to the county committee, and lately our petition was returned back to the home committee—the local committee. We are at their mercy whatever they will do with us; but I wish to cry loudly just now for the want of a road, that it may come to the ears of the legislators. ",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",97
"98","505. Do you pay the same rate as others pay?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",98
"99","—Yes, the same rate as the highest tenant in Skye.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",99
"100","506. Sheriff Nicolson.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",100
"101","—How many miles are you off the high road?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",101
"102","— About four miles.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",102
"103","507. The Chairman.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",103
"104","—If the landlord was prepared to give additional arable ground, and additional common pasture, would the existing crofters be able to cultivate it and stock it?—That depends greatly if the legislators would give us the same kindness as they showed to the Irish. We want may be a few pounds of money and we would pay that in instalments with interest to the Government. That would accommodate us greatly.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",104
"105","508. You mean the Government should advance the money ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",105
"106","—Yes; we would pay that money in instalments, with interest.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",106
"107","509. For which purpose? In order to provide stock ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",107
"108","—Yes, in order to stock a larger proportion of ground.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",108
"109","510. Sheriff Nicolson.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",109
"110","—You have a school there ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",110
"111","—Yes. ",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",111
"112","511. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",112
"113","—What may be the population altogether wanting this road ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",113
"114","—Close up to 200—may be something less than 200.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",114
"115","512. They want these four miles of road?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",115
"116","—Yes. There is another thing. It is generally boasted that the poor man can get the same justice with the rich in Scotland, but there is an exception in Glenmore.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",116
"117","513. The Chairman.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",117
"118","—With regard to the road ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",118
"119","—Yes, for if there was a gentleman there like Tormore, or any of these, they would get a road there immediately.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",119
"120","514. But what measures have you taken to agitate for a road?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",120
"121","— Applying to the local committee and to the county committee.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",121
"122","515. But, do you go on applying every year?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",122
"123","—Yes, every year.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",123
"124","516. How many years have you been trying to get it ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",124
"125","—I believe we began four years ago.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",125
"126","517. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",126
"127","—And who opposes it ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",127
"128","—There is a certain party in the local committee against it. I do not charge it to the factor. He is not against it, but I say in honour to the Rev. Donald Mackinnon, Strath, that he is the best friend we have at court, and our factor, I believe, is likewise inclined to accommodate us.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",128
"129","518. Sheriff Nicolson.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",129
"130","—The nearest church to you is at Portree?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",130
"131","— Yes.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",131
"132","519. And the nearest doctor?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",132
"133","—Yes; and even supposing we need the doctor, the roads are so bad that it is through much fatigue the doctor gets there; and he is not inclined to go there unless he is very well paid for it.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",133
"134","520. The Chairman.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",134
"135","—Have you anything else you particularly wish to say about the state of the Glens?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",135
"136","—I have said all I have to say with regard to that.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",136
"137","521. Sheriff Nicolson.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",137
"138","—How far are the Glens from Portree ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",138
"139","—About six miles.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",139
"140","522. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",140
"141","—The increase of the population in the Glens is merely due to the place itself. There are no people coming in from the outside?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",141
"142","—They have not increased in the meantime, but there is an increase since the time I mention when there were only four families.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",142
"143","523. And they are all relations?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",143
"144","—I believe so.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",144
"145","524. They have not any from outside?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",145
"146","—No.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",146
"147","525. Born in the place ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",147
"148","—Born in the place.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",148
"149","526. Have any people emigrated from the Glens?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",149
"150","—They have.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",150
"151","527. Have they been successful?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",151
"152","—Well, I suppose some of them were successful, and good accounts came from them.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",152
"153","528. Sheriff Nicolson.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",153
"154","—Where from?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",154
"155","—America and Australia.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",155
"156","529. The Chairman.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",156
"157","—Do you remember a time when there was an emigration to America about 1840?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",157
"158","—I remember that, but I cannot give a date for it.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",158
"159","530. Has there been an emigration of late years?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",159
"160","—There are always advertisements in the papers about emigration.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",160
"161","531. And do people sometimes avail themselves of it?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",161
"162","—Yes; we hear that some of them from Uist and Barra are intending to emigrate to some of those colonies.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",162
"163","532. But not from Portree?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",163
"164","—Some left Portree last year for Queensland.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",164
"165","533. If the Government offered facilities for emigration, would they find any persons disposed to avail themselves of these?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",165
"166","—I would like very well if those who are wallowing in wealth would go away, and go where no crofters would obstruct their wishes in land, but, for the poor people of Skye, at present they are blasted with permanent poverty, and that takes away from their courage to go away any length,—pulled down under debt and poverty in many ways which those who are at ease cannotunderstand, and that weakens their hand and weakens their courage so that they cannot think of emigrating anywhere.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",166
"167","534. Do any of them enlist in the royal navy?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",167
"168","—Very few that I know of. I don't know of any from Portree in the navy. There are one or two individuals in the army, but I don't know of any in the navy.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",168
"169","535. Have any families in Skye sent their children on board the Government training ships to be brought up for the navy ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",169
"170","—Yes, some of them go there voluntarily.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",170
"171","536. If the government had a training ship in the vicinity of Skye, among the islands, do you think many of the young people would go on board to be prepared for service in the navy ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",171
"172","—I may say there are some at present training in these ships.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",172
"173","537. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",173
"174","—You are thinking of the naval reserve ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",174
"175","—Yes.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",175
"176","538. The Chairman.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",176
"177","—I mean boys who are sent on board Government training ships, where they receive a gratuitous education, and are brought up to the navy ?",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",177
"178","—I cannot say. I cannot speak for that.",9,"Donald Mcneill","Skye, Braes",178
