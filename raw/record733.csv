"11","â€”I am a native of the parish of Farr, Sutherland. I was born at a place called Dalhoriskel, on Strathnaver, so far as I can ascertain, in 1801. I came to this city the year after King George IV visited it, in 1823 I think it was. The only evictions I witnessed was that which took place in the hamlet in which I was born. That hamlet was composed of five houses. I have heard, however, that the clearances were first begun on the heights of the strath of Kildonan, and that they were afterwards continued on the heights of  Strathnaver, where they were earned out by degrees, till the whole of the inhabitants, down to its very foot, were cleared off. I have, however, a distinct recollection of having seen a number of the people that were evicted on the heights of the strath congregated at the curves on the river, some distance below my father's house, waiting for the couples and some other wood and furniture of their houses, of which they had made rafts, to be floated down by the river while in flood, and which they then dragged ashore. Those, however, were people who were located within a few miles of the confluence of the Naver. Those who were located about Strathy Point, Strathy, and that neighbourhood, had to refloat their wood below the cruives, to be carried down to the sea, at the confluence of the river, where they had a boat to transport it eastwards. The people, having no knowledge of seamanship or the working of a boat, piled their effects principally in its prow, and, by so doing, raised the stern so much out of the water that when they set sail the rudder powerless, and they nearly lost their lives. Finding themselves powerless in the matter, one of them had to go to Strathy Point for a seafaring man to trim their boat for them, and to pilot them to their destination. Some time previous to the Whitsunday term, my father and the rest of the families comprising the hamlet of Dalhoriskel got notice to quit. Where the other families were sent to I do not now remember, but my father was sent to a place called Newland, so called, as up to that time no one had lived in it, being nothing but bare rocks and stones, totally unfit even for goats, far less for human beings, to live in. It was such a place that the people used to say it was the last place that God created, and that He must have been in a hurry while He had done so. I did not go with the rest of my father's family to Newland, but remained at Skelpick with some friends. Immediately the people left the hamlet the houses were set fire to. I witnessed the five houses in flames, which really grieved me more than words can express. I afterwards heard that the manner in which those removals were carried out were harsh in the extreme. But being a matter of history I need not dwell on it. I visited the place only once since I left it, and that is more than thirty years ago, so that my recollections are not so vivid as they once were.",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",11

"14","â€”To the Honourable the Royal Commissioners on the Crofter question,",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",14
"15","â€”' My Lord and Gentlemen, I respectfully beg to state that my appearance before you here is due to the fact that I am a native of the parish of Clyne, in Sutherlandshire, where I was born in the year 1802, and that I resided there during the year when the clearancesâ€”which are now matter of history â€”took place in that county. This being known to a number of my countrymen now located in this city, they have requested me to come before your Honours and give some evidence as to what I observed and witnessed in my native place in those unhappy times to which I have referred. Having acceded to their request, I will endeavour briefly to relate one or two incidents of my early recollections, and afterwards will be glad to answer to the best of my ability any questions which you may be pleased to put to me; but I desire to avoid attaching blame to individuals who were engaged in carrying out the high-handed doings of those days, either as factors or principals. They are now all in their graves; and it would be unkind to their living relatives to be keeping their names before the public in what may be considered an unenviable light. The scenes which I have witnessed in Sutherland in connection with those clearances were of a very distressing nature, and have left a distinct and painful impression on my mind, although I cannot be expected to remember at this distance of time all details of what came under my observation then. I may mention here that my impression of the people who were expelled from their holdings in those days was and is that they would, morally, mentally, and physically, compare favourably side by side with any other peasantry in the world. With regard to the wilful burning of dwelling-houses, that is a point upon whieh there need be no doubt whatever. I beg to assure your Honours that I have seen the atmosphere in Clyne, and for many miles around, filled with the smoke which arose from the burning cottages from which their inmates had been forcibly ejected, in the straths of Kildonan, Brora, Fleet, &c. Other cottages I have seen in the act of being demolished â€”levelled with the ground; and I have seen the people who had occupied them for days without shelter, huddled together at dykesides and roadsides, and on the beach, waiting the arrival of ships to carry them across the Atlantic, or wherever they were forced to go. I have a distinct recollection of seeing a notice, that was issued simultaneously with those proceedings, posted upon the door of the parish church, intimating that any person who was known to have given shelter to, or to have harboured any of the evicted people, would in turn, without any warning, be summarily ejected from his or her house, and be compelled to leave the county; and this harsh decree applied irrespective of any ties of relationship whatsoever. At the present day it is hard to believe that such cruelties were actually perpetrated; but I am here a living witness to testify that it is only too true that such things were done. Permit me to add an expression of the belief I have always had fixed in my mind, that were our landed",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",15
"16","proprietors to take a more personal and practical share in the management of their estates, and come themselves more in contact with the people, the results would generally be of the happiest nature ; and many of the difficulties now surrounding the question before your Honours might never have arisen. The peasantry would have been encouraged and stimulated by the presence of their landlords among them in person; and the bonds of sympathy and confidence which once existed would have been in existence still, conducing materially to the best interests of both. Great wealth has been expended from first to last in vast experiments on the Sutherland estates; and I deplore the fact that the latest great scheme appears to have ended in disappointment and loss to the generous nobleman whose good intentions had originated it. The reason why the reclamations recently carried out so extensively in Sutherland have proved a failure is now well known. The ground chosen was uaturally unsuited for the execution of the design, while plenty of good land, lying waste in the straths, well  adapted by nature for such improvement, might have been utilised and brought at a comparatively small expenditure to yield valuable returns. A happy, prosperous",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",16

"27","â€”Yes.",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",27
"28","45492. I would like to ask you whether you remember anything of the condition of the people in their holdings before their removal ?",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",28
"29","â€”Permit me to say that, so far as I am concerned, I am quite a disinterested man. But I recollect of the peasantry of these straths â€”seeing them in my father's house in my younger days, and comfortable and very respectable men they were. I recollect of that perfectly.",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",29
"30","45493. Was your father himself a crofter?",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",30
"31","â€”He had a little farm, but it was diminished when the flitting took placeâ€”when the removals took place. My father was one of four who had perhaps twenty or so acresâ€”three more along with him; and when the evictions took placeâ€”when the allotments took placeâ€”my father's farm was reduced to four acres or so amongst those who were removed from the heights of the parish.",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",31
"32","45494. We heard a letter read to-day by Mr Sellar, stating that previous to the evictions the people had been in a very miserable condition in these parts of the countryâ€”liable to scarcity and starvation. Do you remember anything at all personally about the general condition of the small tenants, or is it too far before your time ?",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",32
"33","â€”I believe it was in my time it took place. I recollect perfectly for the last seventy years, and a more comfortable peasantry I never saw.",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",33

"40","45498. Were they well dressed and substantial-looking people ?",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",40

"54","45504. Have you any recollection of a famine in the year 1816 ?",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",54
"55","â€”-No, but I have mind, after they were all put to the coast, that the tenants out of the strath were placed in amongst the old tenants, and they had  no means to live. Some of the land they had was invaded by the new tenants; and I mind of the Duke of Sutherland sending them help.",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",55
"56","45505. It is said to have been a common thing in those times, whenever there was a bad season, for the people to be in a state bordering on starvationâ€”was it so ?",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",56
"57","â€”I never mind but of that year, and it was after Strathnaver was cleared.",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",57
"58","45506. Did they raise corn enough to feed themselves?",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",58
"59","â€”Scarcely; some of them. But they would depend upon cattle altogether. I mind one man came to the neighbourhood where I was, and he had twenty-one head of black cattle, forby six horses and sheep; I cannot tell what number of sheep. These came from Garvealt.",733,"James Macdonald, John Mackay","Edinburgh, ",59
