"1","ALEXANDER MACKENZIE, Crofter and Carpenter, Strath of Gairloch (56)—examined.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",1
"2","28740. The Chairman.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",2
"3","—We understand that the whole croft in Strath is about four acres, and the summing two cows and followers and sixteen or twenty sheep. What is the general rent?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",3
"4","—The average area of arable is from 3½ to 4 acres; the summing is two cows and a young beast, and about sixteen sheep.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",4
"5","28741. And what is the rent ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",5
"6","—£3, 10s. to £5 would be the average, but it ranges from £1 to £6.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",6
"7","28742. What is the reason of the great diversity ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",7
"8","—It is in consequence of old and poor people being on some of the crofts, or owing to the difference in the soil ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",8
"9","—It is the worst crofts that are cheapest. They were all valued by a surveyor at the time the rents were fixed.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",9
"10","28743. How long is it since the rents were fixed ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",10
"11","—The rents were fixed in 1842 or 1843. When the present manager came about twenty years ago, the rents were slightly reduced ; some slightly raised and some slightly reduced.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",11
"12","28744. The rents are substantially the same as they were forty-two or forty-three years ago ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",12
"13","—Yes, the rent of the place is about what it was forty years ago.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",13
"14","28745. During these forty years has there been any reduction of the hill pasture?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",14
"15","—No.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",15
"16","28746. Has there been any subdivision of the crofts?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",16
"17","—There are a few in the Strath that have been subdivided since that time; I cannot tell about the rest of the estate.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",17
"18","28747. How do people get money to pay the rent; is it from wages at the fishing or off the croft?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",18
"19","—By what they make off the outcome of the stock, by labour, and the proceeds of the fishing—especially the  fishing.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",19
"20","28748. Have wages of labour increased during the last forty years?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",20
"21","—Yes, very much.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",21
"22","28749. And the price of stock has increased?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",22
"23","—Yes.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",23
"24","28750. His the gain from the fishing increased ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",24
"25","—I cannot say that the proceeds of the fishing have increased. They don't make more out of the",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",25
"26","herring fishing anyhow, but there is the cod and ling fishing. The prices of those fish are better, and probably they will make more out of that than they did.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",26
"27","28751. The area of the holding has remained the same, the rent has remained the same, and the prices of the stock and fish have increased ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",27
"28","—That is quite the case.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",28
"29","28752. Then I hope I may also say that the condition of the people generally has improved ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",29
"30","—The crop of the croft is practically worthless, it has changed very much—it has changed almost entirely within that period. I have a croft myself of 3½ acres, and I have not sent a grain of oats to the mill for the last three years, only I sold three barrels of oats last year of the proceeds of the previous year, and I have only one head of cattle, and I only kept one cow before. If I had kept more stock I would have required to buy about twenty stooks of corn for each head of stock.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",30
"31","28753. Is this owing to the bad seasons or to the permanent depreciation of the soil?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",31
"32","—The weather may have had something to do with it, but the land is poor, and stony, and rocky.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",32
"33","28754. I see there is a complaint about the difficulty of getting seaweed—explain that?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",33
"34","—The portion of the sea-sh»re which is set apart for the crofters is nearly worthless for sea-ware, it does not grow upon the rocks there, and the rest of the sea-ware round about the coast belongs to the farmers.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",34
"35","28755. Is the right to gather that sea-ware exclusively reserved for their tacks; do they possess an exclusive right under their leases ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",35
"36","—Yes; I think when a farmer gets a lease he gets the right to the sea-ware upon his own shore in the lease —to the whole of his own shore.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",36
"37","28756. Is there upon the shores of the farms plenty for the use of the farmer and for the use of the crofters ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",37
"38","—Undoubtedly.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",38
"39","28757. What do the farmers charge you for the sea-ware?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",39
"40","—The price was 5s. for the load of a boat of 16 feet keel, or Id. for every creelfull. ",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",40
"41","28758. If you had nothing to pay for sea-ware would you use a great deal more for your crofts?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",41
"42","—Yes, and it would improve our crofts very much, for nothing makes better crofts than manuring the land with seaware. We have spoilt our crofts by manuring with guano from the want of sea-ware.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",42
"43","28759. Have you represented that to the farmers and to the proprietor?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",43
"44","—There was always a complaint about it which they might have heard.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",44
"45","28760. Did you ever ask the farmer to give you the sea-ware which he did not require, for nothing ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",45
"46","—No, there was no need; he would not give it to us; it is not likely he would.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",46
"47","28761. Are all the farmers the same, or are some of them more generous than others?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",47
"48","—I only went to a few of them. There were some who refused and some who gave the sea-ware.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",48
"49","28762. What are the regulations about estate labour ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",49
"50","—Sixty hours in the year.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",50
"51","28763. When you give that labour do you receive any wages?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",51
"52","—No.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",52
"53","28764. Do you receive any food ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",53
"54","—No.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",54
"55","28765. Did it always exist as an obligation in old times?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",55
"56","—It has certainly existed since 1851, since I took a croft.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",56
"57","28766. If it is inconveuient for anyone to give labour himself is he allowed to find a substitute ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",57
"58","—Yes, he can provide a substitute; of course at his own expense.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",58
"59","28767. What have you to pay for a day's labour if you provide a substitute ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",59
"60","—Perhaps 2s. 6d. or 3s.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",60
"61","28768. Is this labour given to the proprietor or to the farmer?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",61
"62","—There was some of it done upon the proprietor's ground, but it is chiefly upon the roads; there is scarcely anything done now to the property, it is all upon the roads.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",62
"63","28769. Is it the branch roads which lead to your crofts?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",63
"64","—Yes, the branch roads.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",64
"65","28770. Then it is for your own good ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",65
"66","—Yes, there is also some of it used in repairing the march fences between ourselves and the big farmers.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",66
"67","28771. Does the farmer work too?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",67
"68","—Yes, he just makes a share; the big farmer only builds a crofter's share of the dyke—an equal share with one crofter.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",68
"69","28772. There is a complaint about the regulations on the estate with reference to compensation for improvements —explain that if you please ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",69
"70","—When one builds a house he gets the wood for the roof, and according to the estate regulations which are printed, if a crofter is in possession of a croft for twenty years there is no compensation given for the house even supposing he had expended £20 or £100 upon it.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",70
"71","28773. When you want a new house do you apply for it, and do you always get the assistance of the proprietor?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",71
"72","—No. I don't require to ask the permission of the proprietor to build a house, the houses were built when the crofts were let. If it were in disrepair I should begin to do it, and I should go to the proprietor and ask for the wood for the roof.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",72
"73","28774. And he would give it?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",73
"74","—Always.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",74
"75","28775. Who gives the slates ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",75
"76","—-There are no slated houses; we just get the wood for the roof.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",76
"77","28776. In building a new house, how much of the expense would a crofter be at ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",77
"78","—I am repairing my own house just now. Supposing I were to fell it to the ground it would cost about £30 to build it again in addition to what assistance I might get from the proprietor.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",78
"79","28777. What would the assistance of the proprietor be worth?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",79
"80","—About £3, 10s. or £4.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",80
"81","28778. Who supplies the lime ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",81
"82","—- The tenant.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",82
"83","28779. Have there been any removals or evictions in the place, within the memory of the present generation, except for non-payment of rent ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",83
"84","—I cannot very well tell, because I only entered into possession myself in 1851, but ever since Sir Kenneth Mackenzie became proprietor of the estate there have been scarcely any sent away. He is a very kind landlord.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",84
"85","28780. Do you suffer at all from the depredations of the deer or game ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",85
"86","—No, nothing.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",86
"87","28781. In your memorial you say: ' The hill pasture has undergone a process of curtailing to gratify the farmers on both sides' what does that mean ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",87
"88","—Yes, there has been such a process ; the last instance of it was ten years ago.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",88
"89","28782. Describe what it was?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",89
"90","—Just a bit that was taken from the better side of the hill and added to the adjacent farm.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",90
"91","28783. Did you get another bit instead of it?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",91
"92","—Ye3.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",92
"93","28784. Was this in the way of straightening the marches, or was it a large bit which was taken away and given to the farmer ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",93
"94","—It made the march rather more correct than before, but the reason was that the farmer wished to get it ; he did not get exactly all he asked, all the same.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",94
"95","28785. Was any reduction of rent made in consequence?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",95
"96","—No.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",96
"97","28786. Perhaps it was not large enough to make a reduction of rent ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",97
"98","—Well it was large enough to become an object of desire to that farmer anyhow j if it had not been worth money he would not have set his eye upon it. It is a good large bit, and it is one of the best portions of the pasture, although I cannot tell the acreage of it.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",98
"99","28787. Is your stock troubled or vexed by the farmers or shepherds, or do you live on good terms with these people ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",99
"100","—Yes, we have good neighbours; we have no complaints to make on that score.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",100
"101","28788. Have you any complaint to make about the gamekeepers?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",101
"102","—None whatever.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",102
"103","28789. Is your hill pasture fenced in ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",103
"104","—Yes, indeed it is.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",104
"105","28790. Who paid for the fence ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",105
"106","—We did our share of it ; we don't know whether it was the proprietor or the tenant who did the other share.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",106
"107","28791. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",107
"108","—What was the name of the farm to which this bit of pasture was added ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",108
"109","—Auchtercairn.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",109
"110","28792. What is the name of the tenant?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",110
"111","—Dr Robertson.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",111
"112","28793. Has he a large possession in Gairloch ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",112
"113","—No, it is not very large; there are no large farms.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",113
"114","28794. Would you be able to pay your rent out of your croft if you did not labour otherwise ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",114
"115","—No. Except that I like to have a cow and a house I would have nothing to do with a croft, if it were not for these and the potato ground it would be of no service to me. I have made the calculation several times, and I have the idea that I could buy in the market as much as my croft produces cheaper than by the labour expended in producing it on the croft.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",115
"116","28795. Anything you sell will be such as a young beast?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",116
"117","—Yes, I sell nothing else.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",117
"118","28796. Was it therefore a kind thing to deprive you of the best part, or a very good part of your pasture without giving any compensation ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",118
"119","—It was a loss, not a kindness.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",119
"120","28797. Are you allowed by the regulations to keep a dog?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",120
"121","—No.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",121
"122","28798. Or a gun ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",122
"123","—No. ",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",123
"124","28799. Is there any attempt in the regulations to compel the people to be sober ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",124
"125","—The people are left very much to their own free will in that respect, but they are a sober people, not only in the place, but all over the country. ",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",125
"126","28800. That being the case—and I for one am delighted to hear it, and believe it thoroughly—what cause was there to insert in the estate regulations a clause to this effect: 'should the tenant wilfully infringe any of the preceding rules and conditions, or fail to maintain good neighbourhood, or neglect to provide in terms of law for his children, or be habitually drunken,' &c,—what is the meaning of that?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",126
"127","—The rule was laid down, not because the people were not a sober people, but in order to put them upon their guard that in the event of anyone being found so, he would have to leave the district.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",127
"128","28801. You don't consider it a reflection upon the character of the people that they are obliged to accept such a clause?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",128
"129","—No.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",129
"130","28802. Are you obliged to pay the rents the year before the crop is reaped ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",130
"131","—I am not paying anyhow, and perhaps there are a few who do not pay it, but the general rule upon the estate is to pay the rent beforehand.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",131
"132","28803. Are you aware that you must pay at Martinmas 1883, say for the crop of 1884—that that is the estate regulation?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",132
"133","—No, that is not the way it is put in the books, but as the crofts were allotted out first, before they yielded crops the rent was paid, and the thing was continued.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",133
"134","28804. Look at the first article of Estate Regulations ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",134
"135","—There is that regulation, but it is reversed in my case. I pay in Martinmas next for the crop of the year 1883.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",135
"136","28805. Would you consider it a hardship to pay your rent a full year beforehand ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",136
"137","—I never heard it complained of.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",137
"138","28806. What estate labour has a crofter keeping a horse to give ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",138
"139","—I cannot tell exactly; but if he brings his horse he gets off for three days instead of six.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",139
"140","28807. Do the crofters pay road money ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",140
"141","—I think not excepting statute labour—that is six days. We pay poor rates, but we pay no road rates.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",141
"142","28808. The proprietor pays the road rate for you ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",142
"143","—I suppose so; his own share of it.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",143
"144","28809. What grievance, then, have you got ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",144
"145","—That our land is small, and that, in proportion to its value it is dear.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",145
"146","28810. Could it be extended if the proprietor so willed it?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",146
"147","—The proprietor has not much to divide amongst us, but there is a little, and so the holdings might be a little enlarged. There are other modes in which the condition of the people might be improved. A community of fishermen might be planted in various places where nobody dwells; in, for example, the two islands of Longa and Horrisdale.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",147
"148","28811. What would you do with these two islands?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",148
"149","—I would send three or four crews to one place, and they could have a cow and an acre or two acres of land for each family.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",149
"150","28812. Would that keep them in comfort with the produce of their own labours on the sea?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",150
"151","—Yes, if the fishing would continue as at present they would be better off in that way ; and these islands —I speak especially of Longa—are accessible and convenient for the fishing industry.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",151
"152","28813. Who possesses the island just now?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",152
"153","—The tenant is Mr Macdonald, and the proprietor is Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",153
"154","28814. Does the tenant make any use of it except for grazing?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",154
"155","—No, nothing.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",155
"156","28815. When you sell a beast what market do you go to?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",156
"157","—There are markets in the place",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",157
"158","28816. In Gairloch?-",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",158
"159","—Yes; and at Tollie, halfway between this and Gairloch.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",159
"160","28817. Are there any shops in Gairloch ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",160
"161","—Two.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",161
"162","28818. Can you get anything to buy there?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",162
"163","—I cannot get everything I want, but I get the common necessaries, meal and groceries and clothes",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",163
"164","and boots.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",164
"165","28819. Who keeps these shops?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",165
"166","—Both people are of the name of Macpherson.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",166
"167","28820. Have they been long there ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",167
"168","—A long time.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",168
"169","28821. Is there anybody connected with the estate who deals in meal and supplies the people ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",169
"170","—I know nobody who keeps meal but the manager.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",170
"171","28822. What is his name ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",171
"172","—Mr Mackenzie.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",172
"173","28823. Does he carry on an extensive business ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",173
"174","—Yes, he sells oats and guano. ",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",174
"175","28824. Does he buy things from the people ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",175
"176","—Nothing, unless maybe a head of cattle now and again.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",176
"177","28825. Would he be displeased if the people did not give him the offer of the best of the beasts ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",177
"178","—No ; he is just exactly like any drover so far as I know ; he does not care.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",178
"179","28826. Have you ever sold a beast to him?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",179
"180","—Yes, I sold him a cow last year.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",180
"181","28827. Did you get a good price?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",181
"182","—I got almost all I asked for it.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",182
"183","28828. Is it or is it not a grievance iu the place that an official of the estate is also a dealer?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",183
"184","—I never heard the tenants complain of it among themselves, but I believe it is a matter of complaint with the other dealers whose custom is spoiled.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",184
"185","28829. Are you aware whether Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, the proprietor, knows of such dealings going on ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",185
"186","—I cannot tell.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",186
"187","28830. Is it necessary for the requirements of the district that an official of the estate should be a dealer in this way, or should the business not properly be thrown open to the world ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",187
"188","—It would be quite easy for other people to do it, and the more that other traders get of the traffic the",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",188
"189","more they would like it.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",189
"190","28831. But would it not be better for the people?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",190
"191","—I don't think it would.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",191
"192","28832. How long has this been going on ? Did the previous ground officer carry on such a business?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",192
"193","—No.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",193
"194","28833. Was it ever heard of on the estate until this man came ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",194
"195","—Not that I have heard of.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",195
"196","28834. Did the people wish him to start this business?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",196
"197","—I cannot tell.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",197
"198","28835. Does he carry on the business for his own behalf or from a philanthropic desire to benefit the district?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",198
"199","—I think every trader trades for his own benefit; but he may benefit the community as well.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",199
"200","28836. Are the people of the township in arrears for their rents, or are their rents pretty well paid up ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",200
"201","—I believe they are not quite clear of, arrears, but I don't know that their arrears were ever less than they are now.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",201
"202","28837. Was there some destitution in Gairloch last spring?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",202
"203","—Yes, but that arose from the loss of the crops last autumn ; and the potatoes were quite a failure.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",203
"204","28838. Are you aware that the clergymen of the locality found it necessary to make application for assistance from other quarters ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",204
"205","—Yes, and they got assistance, and it was of service when it came into the country.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",205
"206","28839. Can you say from your own knowledge of the whole circumstances that it was necessary for the committee and others to have made that application ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",206
"207","—Yes, I think it was necessary; I don't know what the condition of some of the people who got assistance would have been without it.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",207
"208","28840. The Chairman.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",208
"209","—[To Macgregor]. You have heard and understood everything he has said ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",209
"210","—Yes.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",210
"211","28841. Do you agree with all that he has said?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",211
"212","—Not with the whole of it.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",212
"213","28842. In what respect do you disagree with it ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",213
"214","—He said he had no fault to find with the neighbouring tenants in their treatment of the crofters' stock. I remember the crofters' stock being poinded by the neighbouring tenant on one occasion.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",214
"215","28843. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",215
"216","—Anything else ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",216
"217","—When I was a small boy I used to herd my father's stock upon the portion of the hill pasture which has been taken from the crofters and given to the farm of Auchtercairn, and if the cattle strayed over the march at that time they would be poinded. Since that time I have seen cattle coming from the grazing upon the other side —that is the place called Little Sanda —and these were poinded also; and many of the people to whom they belonged were from home at the time.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",217
"218","28844. Do you differ from your colleague in any other respect ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",218
"219","—No.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",219
"220","28845. The Chairman.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",220
"221","—Did you not prevent the cattle from going over the march ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",221
"222","—Yes, when I was there. I remember upon the occasion of the inspection of the local volunteers at Dingwall that some of the crofters' cattle were thrown down and carried away to the pound.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",222
"223","28846. How long ago was that ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",223
"224","—Perhaps nine or ten years. With respect to the statute labour, not only is it done upon roads and upon fences, as the other delegate stated, but I am of opinion that I may have seen it being done upon the fence between the arable ground and the hill pasture of the farmer—that was a fence not upon the march of the crofter at all. [Intimation that sixty hours' labour would be required of the witness produced, dated 23rd February, 1881].",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",224
"225","28847. Were you a crofter then ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",225
"226","—No; I was a householder. I have a fifty years' lease of the house.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",226
"227","28848. Is it a condition of the lease that you have to do this labour ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",227
"228","—No, not of the lease of the house ; but in the event of my doing it, it is stated that I would get other privileges, right to peat ground and sea-ware.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",228
"229","28849. Therefore you have to perform the labour ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",229
"230","—I have not done it. I only pay 5s. of ground rent, and I think 10s. in addition for statute labour is an excessive sum.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",230
"231","28850. Have you anything else to say ?",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",231
"232","—Upon the farm of Sandabeg there was a regulation made within the last few years that anyone who in future should cut peats there, must pay 5s. a year for every bank that he might cut; now the people used to cut peats there, in former times, free of charge.",483,"Alexander Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Poolewe",232
