"1","NEIL MACLENNAN, Crofter, Breasclete Park (47)—examined.",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",1
"2","14439. The Chairman.—Have you been freely elected a delegate?",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",2
"3","—Yes.",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",3
"4","14440. Have you got a written statement ?",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",4
"5","—Yes. A Statement of the Grievances of Crofters in Breasclete Park (should be called Callernish Park).",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",5
"6","—I have been elected by the crofters of Breasclete Park as their delegate, and the following is the statement I have to make on their behalf. We are now thirty-three years in Breasclete Park. We were formerly in Reef, where we were born and brought up, as also our fathers and grandfathers. The land there was good, and was quite convenient to the sea for fishing, and therefore we lived pretty comfortable. A stranger who wished a sheep farm then fixed upon Reef as a suitable place for that purpose. The result was that we got notice of removal from Mr Scobie, the then factor. We had no arrears of rent, and therefore we refused in a body to do this, and stood out against it for three years, when Mr Scobie's term of office expired. We then naturally expected justice from the next factor ; but, on the contrary, he took up at once the work his predecessor had begun, and at last got us forcibly ejected. Four families, of whom my father was one, came to our present holding, and some of the rest had to go to America. When we came here there were no stones to be got for building a house, and as we had to turn our attention at once to the working of the land which was nothing but a peat moss, we had to make temporary huts at the seashore to shelter us until we got houses made of turf on our lots. I myself remember all this perfectly well. About fourteen acres were allotted to the four families, and as the land was so very bad we got the island of Kiva for grazing at a rent of £5. This was our best help at that time, and we held it for five years, until the late factor Mr Munro came in, when it was taken from us. There are now nine families on the same amount of land a3 was originally allowed to four. Further, we have reason to complain of the annual increase of the rates, which has now reached to not less then 3s. in the £, the rights of which we cannot well understand ; in short, when we came to our present holdings, the rent was only £11, 8s., and owing to the overcrowding and increase of rents and taxes, it has come to £15, 4s. 5d. sterling. We want more lands, with fair rents, fixity of tenure, with compensation for improvements, and we hope the Government will see their way to help us to stock our lands and build houses, which we are all willing to pay with interest through course of time, and humbly hope Her Majesty's Government will be pleased to grant us our humble request.—NEIL M'LENNAN, Delegate.'",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",6
"7","14441. Mr Cameron.",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",7
"8","—How many heads of families are there now in this place you represent ",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",8
"9","—Six.",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",9

"35","14454. Was there less rock upon it?",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",35

"37","14455. Did the crofters possess more stock at Reef than they do now?",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",37

"55","14464. How came they to go away at last when Mr Munro insisted upon it ?",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",55
"56","—So far as my own recollection goes, and the testimony of the only old man now living who came from there at that time, there were works going on—roads and so on—under Government, and it was by these works that they were in the habit of providing for their families, and paying their rents. So, when they were turned out in this way, and refusing to leave the place, each foreman having charge of the works got notice that no work was to be given to the people of this place. They then fell into arrears of rent when they did not get work, and so, when this additional hold was got on them, go they must, because the rent was not paid.",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",56
"57","14465. This paper states they were not in arrears. Was there much poverty amongst them at that time ?",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",57
"58","—Some of them were poor enough. The years in which they were sent away were very bad years. One of the men who was sent from there to Lochganvich, and afterwards was sent to America, was uuwilling to emigrate. The officers came to his house and quenched his fires, and sent him out of the house to the steamer that was waiting to carry him away, and his only cow was left at the back of the door, and he got nothing for it. His brother afterwards sold the cow, and sent the proceeds to him.",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",58

"61","14467. Were those works executed by Sir James Matheson ?",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",61

"63","14468. How long did those works continue after the period when work was refused to this particular township ?",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",63

"65","14469. Were there any other works going on that employed the people, except roads ?",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",65

"75","14474. Can you tell us when the works given by the proprietor ceased at that period ?",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",75
"76","—I cannot tell.",254,"Neil Maclennan","Lewis, Breasclete",76
