"2","23157. The Chairman.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",2
"3","—Were you present when the crofters or small tenants from Stronsay gave their evidence?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",3
"4","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",4
"5","23158. Have you any statement to make with reference to what you heard?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",5
"6","—I would try to answer any questions put in reference to it.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",6
"7","23159. There was a complaint made by the small tenants that they were obliged to labour to the farmer. These small tenants are subtenants on your farm, I presume?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",7
"8","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",8
"9","23160. They complain that they are obliged to furnish labour and to labour at inconvenient times, and at unsatisfactory rates : we would like to hear you upon the subject. Do you occasionally exact the labour, for instance, of a fisherman, at a time when he might have made profitable employment by going to the sea?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",9
"10","—No. ",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",10
"11","23161. When you call upon a labourer for his service, do you consider whether it is convenient for him to go or not?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",11
"12","—I do consider that to a certain extent.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",12
"13","23162. If, for instance, a labourer came to you and said, ' I cannot come to-day, because it is a good day for my fishing,' would you allow him to go to the fishing?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",13
"14","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",14
"15","23163. And when it is inconvenient for the labourer to go to you, will you accept a substitute for him?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",15
"16","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",16
"17","23164. And when you accept the substitute does the labourer pay you some money, and do you find the substitute, or does the labourer himself send the substitute?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",17
"18","—The labourer himself sends the substitute.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",18
"19","23165. What wages do you give a male adult labourer?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",19
"20","—2s. per day, and,2s. 6d. for draining.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",20
"21","23166. But when the tenant sends you a substitute whom he hires himself, do you think he pays the substitute more than 2s. 6d. a-day, or does he only pay him 2s.?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",21
"22","—I don't know.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",22
"23","23167. Is 2s. a-day the common wages of the country, or do you think that the wages are a little better than 2s. a-day?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",23
"24","—In some parts perhaps it is better.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",24
"25","23168. How long have you been a tenant of Rothiesholni?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",25
"26","—Nine years.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",26
"27","23169. Since the beginning of your lease have the wages of your labourers been raised—do they get more now than they did before?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",27
"28","—They do.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",28
"29","23170. How much have their wages been raised?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",29
"30","—They used to get 2d. per hour—20d. a-day —but now they get 2s.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",30
"31","23171. Do you pay them now not by the hour but by the day?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",31
"32","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",32
"33","23172. Have the hours of labour in the country, generally speaking, been shortened or lengthened, or are they the same?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",33
"34","—Just the same.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",34
"35","23173. There was a considerable complaint about the obligation to furnish female labour; what sort of female labour is generally furnished? The small tenants complain that they are obliged to furnish a woman, and that they are obliged to feed her, and that the food costs perhaps £3, 10s.; but do they generally send members of their own family, or do they hire women?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",35
"36","—When they have them, they send women of their own family, and when they have not they have to hire them.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",36
"37","23174. Do you think in most cases they are members of their family, or do they hire in some cases?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",37
"38","—In most cases they have them within their own family.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",38
"39","23175. You pay Is. a day for female labour?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",39
"40","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",40
"41","23176. Do you think they have to pay more than Is. a day when they hire them?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",41
"42","—No, I don't think so.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",42
"43","23177. Do you think you could command female labour in the open market for Is. per day?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",43
"44","—Yes, in our island.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",44
"45","23178. You heard the people complain a good deal of this; and at the same time they stated that in case these obligations were abolished, the farmers would be able to find labour in the open market. You think you can find female labour at Is. a day?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",45
"46","—Yes, I could not find it without them, because I am isolated in one end of the island.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",46
"47","23179. You could not find it without them?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",47
"48","—No.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",48
"49","23180. Could you hire female labour, as they do in the south country, for the six months to do that description of work on the farm which the female labourers do?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",49
"50","—I would not get them.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",50
"51","23181. Do you think you would be able to find labourers for 2s. 6d.a day, if these people were not bound to labour for you?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",51
"52","—Not out of the place.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",52
"53","23182. Supposing these obligations to labour were all abolished, and that you were all free, you would not be able to pay as good a rent as you do now; it would be more expensive to you to find labour?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",53
"54","—Yes, it would.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",54
"55","23183. The supply of obligatory labour in your neighbourhood enables you to pay a better rent than you would otherwise be able to do?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",55
"56","—Yes, it does.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",56
"57","23184. Would you have any objection, in case it were so ordered, that these obligations to labour should be dissolved, would you be on easier terms with the people, supposing always that you had an ensured reduction of rent, would you like it better, or do you like the system of obligatory labour better?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",57
"58","—If I could find the labourers, it would not matter to me.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",58
"59","23185. Do you find that these obligations to labour cause any dissatisfaction between you and the people?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",59
"60","—I believe they are dissatisfied.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",60
"61","23186. When they are obliged to come and work for you, do you think that they work in a grudging manner—do you think they do as little as possible, or do they work as well as possible? Do you think they would work better if they were free?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",61
"62","—I could not say; I have not had the experience.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",62
"63","23187. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",63
"64","—Do you have much kelp made for you?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",64
"65","—Yes, some.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",65
"66","23188. What quantity in the course of the year?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",66
"67","—About twenty or thirty tons.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",67
"68","23189. And you give £2, 5s. a ton for the making of it?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",68
"69","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",69
"70","23190. Have you any idea what wages that affords to the people who make it?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",70
"71","—I cannot say, because they make it at times that are suitable, and they are not counting their time, I suppose; and it is according to the weather and how the ware comes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",71
"72","23191. But when you say they make it at suitable times—you mean the time suitable for making kelp?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",72
"73","—Yes, the time suitable for making kelp—the dry weather.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",73
"74","23192. They must choose the time according to the weather?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",74
"75","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",75
"76","23193. And may be not a time convenient for them?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",76
"77","—Yes, it may be.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",77
"78","23191. Is there much profit to be made on kelp?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",78
"79","—There is a little.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",79
"80","23195. Is there much demand?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",80
"81","—Not so much; it is down this year from what it was last year.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",81
"82","23196. What is the market price of the kelp, such as you make here?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",82
"83","—£1, 15s. per ton.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",83
"84","23197. That is the highest class of kelp that is made—where do you sell it?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",84
"85","—At Falkirk, to Fairlie & Co.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",85
"86","23198. I suppose in taking the farm here you considered it as part of the natural profit of the farm, that kelp could be made upon it?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",86
"87","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",87
"88","23199. You have been nine years here?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",88
"89","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",89
"90","23200. You found the cottars on the farm that are there now?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",90
"91","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",91
"92","23201. Did you find them all there?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",92
"93","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",93
"94","23202. And have you kept them all on?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",94
"95","—No; there are some of them not there now, but where they are I don't know.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",95
"96","23203. Did you replace those who left by others; did you bring in others in place of those who left?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",96
"97","—In place of some of them.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",97
"98","23204 Had you any great demand for their places?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",98
"99","—Yes. ",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",99
"100","23205. Was there more than one applicant for every vacancy that occurred?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",100
"101","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",101
"102","23206. You could not take in more people than there were vacancies for?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",102
"103","—Yes, I could.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",103
"104","23207. What became of those who left?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",104
"105","—Some of them went to Kirkwall, and some of them are in the island still.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",105
"106","23208. Was it of their own free will that they left, or did you discharge them?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",106
"107","—Some of them left of their own free will.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",107
"108","23209. And some you removed?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",108
"109","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",109
"110","23210. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",110
"111","—Have you a lease of your farm?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",111
"112","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",112

"114","—No, I have the plan of the farm. ",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",114
"115","23212. Can you mention as nearly as possible the substance of the clause that is in the lease which regulates this matter of the service of these people?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",115
"116","—No, I could not",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",116
"117","23213. Can you not tell us the import or purport of it?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",117
"118","—I could not.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",118
"119","23214. Does it give you the power to remove them if they don't do it?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",119
"120","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",120
"121","23215. You said to the Chairman that you consulted the convenience of these people to some extent?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",121
"122","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",122
"123","23216. When you want any labour done which must be done, we shall suppose, instantly, or in a hurry, don't you expect the people to come whether it is convenient for them or not, if it is convenient for you?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",123
"124","—Yes, if it is the day for threshing with the mill. I have a steam mill, and if it is the day for it, which is one day in the week, I generally want them to come that day, but not any other day.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",124
"125","23217. But one day in the week they must come?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",125
"126","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",126
"127","23218. In fact, your bargain is with the landlord, you make no agreement with the people?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",127
"128","—I have an agreement with them in regard to their holdings.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",128
"129","23219. What agreement is that?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",129
"130","—They pay their rent to me and furnish the labour.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",130
"131","23220. Can you raise their rents?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",131
"132","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",132
"133","23221. Although your own rent is fixed for the term of your lease, yet you have the power of raising their money rent; is that so?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",133
"134","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",134
"135","23222. But you have no power to exact more of that labour than is stated in your lease? you cannot increase the number of days, can you?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",135
"136","—There is no exact number of days stated.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",136
"137","23223. There is no number of days fixed in the lease?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",137
"138","—No.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",138
"139","23224. Can you ask them to go for 300 days in the year?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",139
"140","—No.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",140
"141","23225. Why not, if it is not specified; it is simply your own good will that you don't choose to do it?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",141
"142","—I don't require it.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",142
"143","23226. But supposing that you did require the labour for every lawful day in the year, there is nothing in the lease from the proprietor to prevent you demanding it?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",143
"144","—Nothing.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",144
"145","23227. What is your present rent?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",145
"146","—£421, 11 s. 9d.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",146
"147","23228. Will you tell me what rent you would pay, or you could afford to pay, the proprietor if you had not this labour?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",147
"148","—I cannot say.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",148
"149","23229. Could you pay one-half?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",149
"150","—Oh, yes..",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",150
"151","23230. Come as near as you can?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",151
"152","—I could not give a definite answer to that.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",152
"153","23231. Could you pay £300?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",153
"154","—I could not give a definite answer.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",154
"155","23232. Would it be a good deal less rent which you could afford to pay if this involuntary labour were removed?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",155
"156","—Yes, a good deal less.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",156
"157","23233. Are you quite satisfied with things as they are?-",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",157
"158","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",158
"159","23234. You don't complain of it?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",159
"160","—No.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",160
"161","23235. Do you know whether the landlord complains of it?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",161
"162","—I don't think he does.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",162
"163","23236. The only persons who complain are the people?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",163
"164","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",164
"165","23237. Professor Mackinnon.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",165
"166","—The number of families is thirteen?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",166
"167","—Yes; that is, of cottars.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",167
"168","23238. And the total acreage of the farm is?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",168
"169","—1636 acres.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",169
"170","23239. Seven of these thirteen families occupy about 189 acres according to this complaint—does that represent the whole of their holdings?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",170
"171","—That is squared off, they don't hold that.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",171
"172","23240. Of those who were sent away there were some whose places were not filled; what did you do with their crofts? ",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",172
"173","—Some of them were taken into the farm.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",173
"174","23241. And the others?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",174
"175","—The places of the others were supplied by other people.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",175
"176","23242. Under your lease you can send them away any year—can you send them away at any time '.-",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",176
"177","—There is part of the east side of the hill which the proprietor wished to have removed for the purpose of taking in sheep.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",177
"178","23243. But I should like to know the power you have under the lease to deal with these families. Have you the power to dispossess them all, or any of them, whenever you please?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",178
"179","—Yes, I have the power.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",179
"180","23244. That is, of course, at any one term. You could not dispossess them in the middle of a year?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",180
"181","—No; they occupy from year to year.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",181
"182","23245. You have power to raise their rents or to reduce them?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",182
"183","— Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",183
"184","23246. And to call upon them for service any day?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",184
"185","—Yes.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",185
"186","23247. Does any one of them ever make as much wages by his service as his rent?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",186
"187","—No, I don't suppose he does.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",187
"188","23248. Is the female labour separate from the male labour?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",188
"189","—Yes, the female labour is for the six months in the summer.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",189
"190","23249. And for that you pay 30s.?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",190
"191","—Is. a day.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",191
"192","23250. Would you be quite prepared to compound with these men for Is. a day—would you take from these men the amount of money you pay for these female servants?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",192
"193","—No; because I could not get labour for it.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",193
"194","23251. You could not get labour at your end of the island without this regulation?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",194
"195","—No.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",195
"196","23252. And under this lease they are bound to work at kelp as long as you wish them?",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",196
"197","—From a ton or upwards, each house.",400,"James Twatt","Orkney, Sanday",197
