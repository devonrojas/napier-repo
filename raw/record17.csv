"2","1082. The Chairman.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",2
"3","—Before we go further, Mr Alexander Macdonald wishes to make a communication to us.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",3
"4","1083. Mr Alexander Macdonald.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",4
"5","—I am sorry to hear that some of Lord Macdonald's tenants were a little afraid about giving evidence. I stated my own belief yesterday that there was no danger to any man for anything whatever that he said. I stated my belief, and since this I have seen Lord Macdonald personally, and told him that some of his tenants were perhaps a little afraid or backward, and his lordship authorises me specially to inform his tenants that they have full liberty to state anything they choose to say, whatever they think proper themselves to say, without any fear of any consequences or any prejudice either from his Lordship or from me, or from any factor. They have full liberty and scope to say whatever they think proper.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",5

"8","1085. The Chairman.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",8
"9","—You are a crofter?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",9
"10","—Yes.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",10
"11","1086. What are you besides a crofter?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",11
"12","—A fisherman.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",12
"13","1087. For what do you receive a pension?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",13
"14","—For the Crimean campaign and Indian mutiny.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",14
"15","1088. You were all through the Crimean campaign?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",15
"16","—Yes, the whole time from beginning to end.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",16
"17","1089. And all through the mutiny?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",17
"18","—It was working when I arrived, and I saw the campaign over before I came home.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",18
"19","1090. And you received a pension, and came back to your native place ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",19
"20","—Yes.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",20
"21","1091. Have you got a croft of your own?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",21
"22","—Half a croft.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",22
"23","1092. Did you have it while you were in the public service?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",23
"24","—No.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",24
"25","1093. You got it after you came home?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",25
"26","—Yes.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",26
"27","1094. You have heard what has been stated by previous witnesses?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",27
"28","— Yes.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",28
"29","1095. You have understood what they have said?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",29
"30","—Yes.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",30
"31","1096. Do you agree in the main with what they said?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",31
"32","—Yes, generally, upon the same complaint that is going with the whole of us.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",32
"33","1097. Have you any suggestion or remarks to make in addition to what they stated ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",33
"34","—Not much ; we belong to a different estate from those that were here before us.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",34
"35","1098. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",35
"36","—Which estate?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",36
"37","—Lord Macdonald's estate. ",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",37
"38","1099. What is the name of your township?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",38
"39","—Tote. As regards Tote and Benmore, the crofts are poor in soil and rocky, and not fit to give good crops, owing ;to the poorness of the soil. In the best harvests it only gives two returns, and frequently about one and a half. We are given three cows and two stirks on each croft, but pasture ground is so bad, small, and poor, that one cow and one stirk would be plenty for the grazing ground so as to keep them in condition as in other places. Frequently cows are two years without having a calf in this town, and often cows will only have calves every second year. The cattle are hand-fed all the year round, feeding them in summer and harvests with grass and corn to keep them alive. To keep the three cows and two stirks we would require three times as much of grazing ground. It is the smallness of the crofts and grazing grounds that keep us here so poor. If we would get more land with reasonable rent, we know we would be well enough off. Us and our fore¬fathers were sub-tenants for the last thirty-six years; this includes the whole of Unikillin. There are ten crofts in Tote and Benmore, and eight cottars in the place. The reason why so many cottars are here is, in the years of '45 and '46 the potatoes failed, and the late Mr Martin took some of them to the place, and used to give them patches of ground for potatoes, and also to be near the yairs. At that time the Fishery Board gave permission to have the yair put in good repair, and those employed at it got one pound of Indian meal per day, and the yair was a great boon to the poor far and near. A few years' back the yair was broken down by orders of Mr L. Macdonald, Skeabost, and Tormore. Frequently at that time families would have nothing in the house at nights; they would go to the yair, and have plenty for their families in the morning. In this place sea-ware is not to be got from tacksmen without payment. When Mr Martin, tacksman of Tote, come to Unikillin in 1839, of the rents on the crofts in Tote, the cheapest croft was £4, 10s., and the highest rent was £6. At the present time the rent is,—cheapest £7, 8s., the highest £10, 18s. We have a club stock of sheep among thirty-nine cofters, but it does not pay well; there is too many about the stock. Wet grouud, and most of it too exposed; also too small for the number about the stock.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",39
"40","1100. Have you anything more to say in addition to that?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",40
"41","—I may mention that in Tote there are ten crofts, and sixteen families on the ten crofts, and eight cottars besides them on the place now. To give pieces of ground to the cottars comes too heavy on the ten crofts, there are so many of them. The yair was the reason so many crowded to Tote; it supplied them constantly with fish.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",41
"42","1101. Anything else?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",42
"43","—Regarding the hill pasture, the neighbours wish me to state that formerly it was made a tack of by one who was in Lyndale, that in the course of three years he lost his stock, and had to leave it, although he had a place which pays very well; and another thing which we have been in dispute about for the last eight years is, that we have been paying for a piece of the hill pasture, and the tenants in Glenmore have claimed the place, and we never got it yet. So we must take it in hand ourselves, and compel them to leave. The factor promised to do it, but it was always shoved off till now, and we cannot bear it any longer.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",43
"44","1102. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",44
"45","—Have they a great piece of grazing there ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",45
"46","—Thirty-nine crofts, and a number of them in halves and quarters.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",46
"47","1103. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",47
"48","—Have you anything more to say?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",48
"49","—1 need not say anything more, because what we would say has been told before—scarcity of ground and pasture.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",49
"50","1104. I see you have got some clasps and medals, what services are they for ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",50
"51","—Sebastopol, Balaklava, the Alma, Lucknow, and the Turkish medal. I have only one clasp for India, but I should have had five, for was in five engagements.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",51
"52","1105. How old are you ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",52
"53","— Sixty-six years of age. I was in the 42nd regiment all the time.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",53
"54","1106. Why are there not more Skye men enlisting, as you did ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",54
"55","—Where are they to be found ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",55
"56","1107. Look around,—the whole people about you here?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",56
"57","—Not many of them would pass. There are sheep and deer instead of soldiers.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",57
"58","1108. That is a bad account of your neighbours?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",58
"59","—They are old and worn out.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",59
"60","1109. But what really is the reason they don't come forward ? Are they physically incapable ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",60
"61","—They don't care about going. The place is cleared of men; there are no young men now.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",61
"62","1110. Have you any other reason ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",62
"63","—I have none, because from the way the people are used here they don't care to go. They have to make a living in other ways.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",63
"64","1111. Has the small pay anything to do with it?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",64
"65","—No, but the way the people are used here.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",65
"66","1112. Sheriff Nicolson.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",66
"67","—How does that make the army disagreeable to them ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",67
"68","—When they see how their people are used there.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",68
"69","1113. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",69
"70","—Explain what you mean ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",70
"71","—Formerly the places would support their families behind them ; now if a young man goes he has to keep his old parents alive, he must remain at home and keep his father alive. From the way crofts are divided, the ground is run out by tilling it every year, and it does not give crops, supposing the seasons were good. And then they go to some other better country, and those at home take their places.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",71
"72","1114. At the time you entered the 42nd were there many from Skye along with you ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",72
"73","—Yes, a good number. Several from my own place, here, died in the Crimea. I think there were a dozen in the same company with me from this part of the island.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",73
"74","1115. Sheriff Nicolson.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",74
"75","—And at this moment, so far as you know, how many Skye men are in the army ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",75
"76","—I have no idea; but none from the island came through the Indian campaign and mutiny, except one man over at Dunvegan.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",76
"77","1116. Do you know how many pensioners are in Skye ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",77
"78","—No.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",78
"79","1117. The Chairman.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",79
"80","—What rank did you attain? Were you a sergeant ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",80
"81","—Yes, but I was discharged.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",81
"82","1118. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",82
"83","—There are delegates here from three localities ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",83
"84","—Yes, and perhaps four.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",84
"85","1119. Are any in those four places in the army at this moment?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",85
"86","—Yes, there is one from Tote, I know.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",86
"87","1120. Any more?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",87
"88","—I am not aware of any more",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",88
"89","1121. Then out of the four townships represented here to-day, there is only one in the service of the army?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",89
"90","—That is all that I know.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",90
"91","1122. You had no reason to complain of the service when you were in the army ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",91
"92","—I had plenty of reason to complain.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",92
"93","1123. But when you were in it?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",93
"94","—Well, for one time I had two years and four months without ever stripping or going to bed. From the time I left Portsmouth till I returned, I never stripped. I was in clothes all the time, and it was hard enough work for all I got.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",94
"95","1124. Well, do you say that if the people got larger crofts and easier rents, the old military spirit would revive?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",95
"96","—There is no doubt about that. It would show there was some care for the people, and not to keep them about the corners as they are now. I am here in a croft, and have nothing but rock and brae, and if all the good soil were gathered together, I do not suppose it would make more than an acre and a half of good natural soil.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",96
"97","1125. One of the witnesses said that the laird of Skeabost, if he wanted it, had really no bounds on his estate to accommodate all the people on it properly. Where could they be accommodated ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",97
"98","—Well, there is no way to do but breaking up the tacks.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",98
"99","1126. Upon some other property?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",99
"100","—Upon Lord Macdonald's property at Skerrinish.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",100
"101","1127. The Chairman.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",101
"102","—Could you suggest anything Government could do which would make the service more popular aud encourage people to enter it ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",102
"103","—They are well off now in the service compared with the time when I was in it; but still it is a large family, and there are always discontents in it—I mean the service. There are in the army every class, gentlemen and blackguards together—they do not care.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",103
"104","1128. But do you think the Government could do anything which in your opinion would encourage people to enlist to a greater extent in this country ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",104
"105","—This is the only thing I know of, because young men, as soon as they come to w-ork, must work to get money to support those at home, and formerly little farmers were independent. They could live without the assistance of their children, and the young men could go to list if they liked. Now, since they can do nothing, they must stay.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",105
"106","1129. Mr Cameron.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",106
"107","—If the farms were made larger, that would give more work for the young men ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",107
"108","—Yes, but they would make more money and get more stock.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",108
"109","1130. Will your people enlist more when they are comfortable than when they are not comfortable ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",109
"110","—Certainly, when there is nothing behind to care for.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",110
"111","1131. But do you think they would be induced to enlist in that way?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",111
"112","—I do not know. Generally, when a man enlists he does not look for anything.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",112
"113","1132. When the recruits came into your regiment were they from a class well-to-do and prosperous, or from a class of young men who probably could not find anything to occupy them ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",113
"114","—Both ways.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",114
"115","1133. Which most?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",115
"116","—I cannot say. They were very much mixed; all classes, farmers' sons, and so on.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",116
"117","1134. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",117
"118","—The 42d is a crack regiment?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",118
"119","—Yes, but I think they are destroyed now.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",119
"120","1135. They used to be?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",120
"121","—Yes, in former times.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",121
"122","1136. Mr Cameron.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",122
"123","—How have they destroyed it?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",123
"124","—By this mixing work. It is a great thing in the service to have a regiment from one district, and it would be good for them in different ways, because if I saw there a comrade from the same place as myself, I would be afraid to commit myself in any way, in case they would write home and tell my friends of what I was doing and how I was .'going on. That was the strongest motive ever I saw, and it would make young men take care not to commit them¬selves. But when they are mixed up this way— Irish, Scotch, and Lowlanders mixed —they don't care so much. There is no person to tell.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",124
"125","1137. Do they like the short service or the long service best?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",125
"126","—Well, some think the short service spoils them, because when they are properly learned their time is up, and there is nothing more dangerous in a campaign than too many young soldiers. They are of no use.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",126
"127","1138. Sheriff Nicolson.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",127
"128","—Did they not do good work in Egypt?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",128
"129","—But if they had to meet Prussians or French it might have been different. I have seen young soldiers in the trenches at Sebastopol who were more a hindrance than an assistance. They were afraid, and the work was so wild that it fairly frightened them, and if the whole trenches had been composed of them they would not have stood one night. I have seen labourers go out there to assist in the trenches. Well, sixty went in one night, and we had only three in the morning. They went away through the night. We found them at Balaklava next morning.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",129
"130","1139. The Chairman.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",130
"131","—Were you freely elected to be a delegate?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",131
"132","—Yes, I was elected here the other day.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",132
"133","1140. In the second or first election?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",133
"134","—The second. ",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",134
"135","1141. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",135
"136","—What arable land have you got?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",136
"137","— I suppose about four acres, between three and four.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",137
"138","1142. In the half croft ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",138
"139","—Yes.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",139
"140","1143. What is your rent ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",140
"141","—£7, 12s.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",141
"142","1144. Is that the rent of the full croft?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",142
"143","—£7, 12s. for the whole croft.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",143
"144","1145. And you pay half of that?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",144
"145","—Yes, £3, 16s. ",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",145
"146","1146. What stock do you keep?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",146
"147","—I keep two cows, but if they have two calves I have too many.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",147
"148","1147. Two cows and one stirk?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",148
"149","—If I have two cows and a calf I have a calf too many for the land. The whole croft for three milk cows and two stirks.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",149
"150","1148. Professor Mackinnon.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",150
"151","—Sheep?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",151
"152","—Thirty for the whole croft.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",152
"153","1149. I mean the summing?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",153
"154","—Well, it is a common stock we have— what we can keep on the ground.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",154
"155","1150. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",155
"156","—You divide the sheep. How many are there who have shares in the common stock ?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",156
"157","—Thirty-nine.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",157
"158","1151. And you have about 1200 sheep?",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",158
"159","—Yes, about 1200 at Martinmas. I do not know how many there are to-day.",17,"John Nicolson","Skye, Skeabost",159
