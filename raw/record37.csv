"50","2264. Was the area of the croft or was the hill pasture reduced in that period?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",50

"52","2265. When the hill was taken away, was the rent reduced ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",52

"54","2266. Did the loss of the hill pasture seriously impair the value of the crofts ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",54
"55","—A great deal. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",55
"56","2267. Did the proprietor perform any useful work or improvements during that period on the farm ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",56
"57","—No. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",57
"58","2268. None at all ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",58

"60","2269. Why were you removed from that croft?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",60
"61","—I had to give up that place owing to the increase of rent, and I got the promise of this croft.

"86","—Was anything wrong about the valuation in your mind ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",86
"87","—Well, I had to put up with it. ~ ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",87
"88","2282. Who was the man you appointed ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",88

"100","—Yes. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",100
"101","2288. How much?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",101
"102","—I got lime from Glasgow, and I had to fetch timber. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",102

"106","—-What grievance have you to state in connection with leaving your farm?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",106
"107","—I had a great grievance to go. I was paying high rents with my father, and keeping cattle, and paying a good deal of money; and I was sent to that croft with the promise that I would get the whole of it, and the half of it was taken from me. My mother was here before me, eighty-four years of age, and my forefathers, and paying honestly, and without being in arrear to the factor or proprietor. I am put on six and a half acres with twelve of a family, and the oldest is seventeen and the youngest about two months. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",107
"108","2291. Is the rent of the present croft or half croft reasonable?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",108
"109","—Well, I don't consider it reasonable, because nothing was taken off for the licence being taken to another place, only the abatement that the whole of the people got of 5s. in the pound. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",109
"110","2292. You are paying the public-house rent though there is no public-house there ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",110
"111","—Yes, only the abatement. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",111
"112","2293. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",112
"113","—Did your brother-in-law leave Feaull as well as yourself ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",113
"114","—Yes. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",114
"115","2294. You both were removed in order that Feaull might be added to Monkstadt ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",115
"116","—Yes. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",116
"117","2295. Professor Mackinnon.",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",117
"118","—I understand you gave up your holding ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",118
"119","— I gave it up because the rent was so high, and my brother-in-law gave up. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",119
"120","2296. Who was in Kilvaxter before you went?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",120
"121","—One Mr M'Millan. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",121
"122","2297. What became of him?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",122
"123","—He was taken to another croft. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",123
"124","2298. Of his own free will ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",124
"125","—Likely it was, at least I do not know. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",125
"126","2299. And you were promised the whole of the croft?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",126
"127","—My mother was promised the whole of the lot. She is not long with me at Kilvaxter. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",127
"128","2300. Was she at Kilvaxter when you were at Feaull ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",128
"129","—No. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",129
"130","2301. But you were promised the whole lot in Kilvaxter belonging to Mr M'Millan?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",130
"131","—-Yes. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",131
"132","2302. Did he have the whole lot ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",132
"133","—Yes. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",133
"134","2303. And another has been put in along with you ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",134
"135","—They kept the half of it for M'Millan. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",135
"136","2304. He has got half of it still?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",136
"137","—Yes, along with another one. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",137
"138","2305. Sheriff Nicolson.",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",138
"139","—Were there any removals from other townships than Feaull in order to give additional land to Monkstadt ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",139
"140","—Yes, there were different places that were removed. There were Graulin, Delista, Benore, Feaull, Glachasay. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",140
"141","2306. Were many people removed from these various places?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",141
"142","—There were twelve families in Graulin and six in Delista; three at Benore, and nine at Feaull, and three at Glachasay, and three at Scour. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",142
"143","2307. Where have these been removed to?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",143
"144","—Most of them are down in Kilmuir, and some abroad. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",144
"145","2308. Was all the land and pasture they had added to the farm of Monkstadt ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",145
"146","—Part of it. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",146
"147","2309. What was done with the rest?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",147
"148","—It was added to Duntulm. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",148
"149","2310. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",149
"150","—Was that all in the present proprietor's time ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",150
"151","—Yes. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",151
"152","2311. And within your own recollection?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",152
"153","—Within my own recollection. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",153
"154","2312. You saw the thing done ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",154
"155","—Yes. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",155
"156","2313. Professor Mackinnon.",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",156
"157","— I understand your own grievance, it is that the place in which you were was rented so highly that you could not live in it. You removed voluntarily ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",157
"158","—Yes. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",158
"159","2314. Sheriff Nicolson.",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",159
"160","—I suppose you thought if you remained there you would be in debt, and could not live ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",160
"161","—Yes. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",161
"162","2315. Professor Mackinnon.",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",162
"163","—Had you a lease?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",163
"164","—No, I never had a lease. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",164
"165","2316. Had you the whole of that large place upon a yearly tenancy?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",165
"166","— Yes. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",166
"167","2317. Would a lease put an end to that unfortunate state of matters you fell into",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",167
"168","—To tell the truth, I would not ask a lease, but I would ask security against people being removed as long as they paid their rents, and did not annoy their neighbours. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",168
"169","2318. Do you mean that the security should be provided by the law? ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",169
"170","—By the law. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",170
"171","2319. The Chairman.",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",171
"172","—How do you think the rent ought to be fixed? Who ought to fix the rent ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",172
"173","—Whatever direction it would come from, it would give something reasonable that the poor people would live upon. We would be thankful to see it. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",173
"174","2320. But who ought to value the land, and say what the proper rent should be ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",174
"175","—The Government. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",175
"176","2321. Professor Mackinnon.",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",176
"177","—You would not trust the proprietor, and it would not be fair that the tenant should fix the rent?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",177
"178","—I would leave it to the Government. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",178
"179","2322. You have been backward and forward through the whole estate over those places that were cleared away ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",179
"180","—Yes; I am well acquainted there. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",180
"181","2323. We had people speaking here of their crofts being too small. Is your knowledge of the countryside sufficient to enable you to say what you would consider a reasonable sized croft in this parish—not one like what you had, but one which you would expect the people to hold in order to be fairly comfortable ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",181
"182","—That would be according to the family they had. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",182
"183","2324. Well, an average family?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",183
"184","—Between £15 and £20 worth. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",184
"185","2325. A croft of £15 or £20?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",185
"186","—Yes, including grazing and arable land. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",186
"187","2326. What stock should a croft of that rent carry ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",187
"188","—Six milk cows, a horse, and a score of sheep. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",188
"189","2327. And you would give for that croft £15 or £20 ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",189
"190","—Willingly. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",190
"191","2328. How many acres of arable land would there be ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",191
"192","—That is according to the valuation of the ground. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",192
"193","2329. But, as ground runs in the parish, taking the good with the bad ? ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",193
"194","—There are more acres under sheep that are worth double the run the poor people have. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",194
"195","2330. Take it good and bad mixed ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",195
"196","—About ten or twelve acres, with the grazing besides. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",196
"197","2331. I suppose you know these large tacks very well?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",197
"198","—Yes, very well ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",198
"199","2332. Do you think there is upon the estate a sufficient amount of land to divide into crofts of that kind ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",199
"200","—Quite sufficient. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",200
"201","2333. And that it would pay as well in such holdings as it would pay in the large holdings ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",201
"202","—I cannot say that. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",202
"203","2334. The Chairman.",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",203
"204","—You think that many of these crofts could be carved out of the tacksmen's farms?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",204
"205","—Many of them could be created upon the tacksmen's farms. It is quite visible that the crofts are still there with their marches, to be seen going through the country. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",205
"206","2335. Many could be made, but would there be many persons found capable of taking and stocking them?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",206
"207","—That is a thing hard to say. People have come to such a poor state that they could not, unless they were supported in some way or other. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",207
"208","2336. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",208
"209","—From your knowledge of the people and their character, if they got assistance—the people who are now reduced to comparative poverty—do you believe, from their character, their honesty, their industry, and otherwise, that they would recover themselves if they got those things ?",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",209
"210","—I do believe it. ",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",210
"211","2337. You thoroughly believe that?-",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",211
"212","—I thoroughly believe that; and another thing I know, there are a few clever men who would do it, and the most of them are very honest people.",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",212
"213","2338. Professor MacKinnon.",37,"Donald Mathieson","Skye, Uig",213
