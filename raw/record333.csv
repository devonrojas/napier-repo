"11","18033. Had they sufficient stock for the place?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",11
"12","—We had not much when we went there, but our stock was increasing. We had a great deal of stock when we left it.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",12

"14","—£11, 5s. or £11, 15s.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",14
"15","18035. How long was your father at Borv?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",15
"16","—In the first place we went to we were allowed to remain three years.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",16

"18","—Big Borv. ",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",18
"19","18037. Were you then removed?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",19

When the people were summoned out of this Little Borv, the factor told them that if they got security they would pay £100 at the next market, they would not be disturbed that year. The minister that was at Scarista at the time—the present minister of South Uist—offered to become security for the required amount, but they would not accept the security.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",30

"33","18044. Were the tenants of Big Borv in arrears at that time?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",33
"34","—I believe they were behind with their rent. The years were very bad, and there was no price for cattle. The prices rose the very year they left, and never fell to the same point since.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",34
"35","18045. Had they any other debts on the stock besides the rent?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",35

"37","18046. At the time they were removed from Little Borv, had all the tenants the full stock?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",37

"42","18048. Was he a man in perfectly good credit and substance?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",42
"43","—Well, he said himself that it was through the factor that he received his stipend, and that his stipend might be good for the sum.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",43
"44","18049. Who was the factor who carried this out?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",44

"48","18051. Had Captain Sitwell been removed by the time they were put away from Borv?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",48
"49","—I cannot tell. It was Captain Sitwell who arranged they should be sent there.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",49
"50","18052. Were all the arrears that were due by your father paid at the time they were summoned out before they were allowed to remove the little stock that remained ?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",50
"51","—I believe not.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",51
"52","18053. Where did your father go after leaving Borv?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",52
"53","—Ardhassaig, West Loch Tarbert.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",53
"54","18054. Did your father build a house when he went first to Big Borv ?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",54
"55","—Yes, where there was not a stone upon the ground,—both house and barn.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",55
"56","18055. Did it necessarily involve a great expenditure to your father?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",56
"57","—There was not much in the outlay. The family assisted to build it.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",57
"58","18056. Did they get any value for the houses when they went to Little Borv ?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",58

"60","18057. Then did you find the houses at Little Borv ready for you?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",60
"61","—There were the walls of the house.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",61

"63","—Yes.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",63
"64","18059. Did you get compensation when they left Little Borv?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",64
"65","—No; but we removed the roof of it when we went away.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",65
"66","18060. Was it with your father's will or the will of the other tenants that they were finally removed from Little Borv?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",66
"67","—No; it was against their will.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",67
"68","18061. Did they ever get a fair chance there of getting on in the world, with these three shiftings in the course of five years ?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",68
"69","—The very opposite. At Ardhassaig again, after we were shifted, we were there a year without land at all. The man into whose land we came had himself cropped it that year, and so we had no crop, and that threw the family back very much.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",69
"70","18062. When you went to Big Borv, what time did you go to it?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",70
"71","—In the beginning of summer.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",71
"72","18063. Was there crop or house or anything there?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",72

"78","18066. How often were the rents uplifted?",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",78
"79","—Twice a year. It was taken from them at any time.",333,"John Mcleod","Harris, Tarbert",79
