"1","JOHN MACKENZIE, Crofter, Callernish (60)—examined.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",1
"2","14879. The Chairman.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",2
"3","—You have a written statement ?",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",3
"4","—Yes. The Callernish Crofters complain of being deprived of two points of their ground, namely, Orosay and Aird, since a long time, and still paying rent for it, as also muir and pasture in common given it to Carloway people. Twenty-eight crofts taken from us and others put on them, some from Garrynahine, and some from Uig, and still the rent rising. Nothing but dykes on every side of us. The crofters must keep the half of them up, or else the factor will take money from them at rent time for it. This township's former rent was £60 ; now its £118. A few years ago, paid for liberty of collecting whelks, and sending them to market south, £15 rent. We are living yet at Callernish that can testify on oath with clear conscience that our eyes saw this taken from us, if we are wanted to do this.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",4
"5","14880. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",5
"6","—Do they gather whelks at Callernish yet ?",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",6
"7","—Yes, they gather all they can. They think them little enough.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",7
"8","14881. Does anybody ask them rent for that right now?",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",8
"9","—I have not been asked to pay rent myself, but I have heard others say they have, and I think some of them are perhaps here.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",9
"10","14882. How many families are there in Callernish?",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",10
"11","—About sixty.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",11
"12","14883. Have they any other means of livelihood except this land for which they are paying £118?",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",12
"13","—We have nothing else to live upon here, except the help that some of our young people give that go fishing.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",13
"14","14884. How long is it since they lost the land which is spoken of here as taken from them ?",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",14
"15","—I barely remember when Aird was taken from them.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",15
"16","14885. It will be fifty years ago?",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",16
"17","—Yes.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",17
"18","14886. And the rest of it was taken before that?",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",18
"19","—Yes. Orosay was taken from us some little time before that.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",19
"20","14887. When were these Gara-na-hine and Uig people put upon your crofts ?",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",20
"21","—Twenty-one years ago.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",21
"22","14888. Why were they taken from Gara-na-hine and Uig?",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",22
"23","—I don't know.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",23
"24","14889. Who got the land round Gara-na-hine and Uig?",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",24
"25","—It is now a part of the land of the innkeeper, and another part of it is a park occupied by the doctor.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",25
"26","14890. How long has your rent stood at £118 ?",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",26
"27","—For a long time.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",27
"28","14891. And what you want is more land at a reasonable rent I suppose ?",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",28
"29","—Yes. We have no pasture at all, only the ground that we till. Our cow must go three miles before she can bend her head to grass.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",29
"30","14892. Who has the grass above Callernish ?",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",30
"31","—It is in the hands of Mr Macrae. I have to say further that there was no reduction of our rent when the Aird was taken from as.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",31
"32","14893. Then the £118 has stood since that time?",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",32
"33","—There was no reduction of our rent when the Reef people was sent in upon us and the Aird was taken from us. There are some of us, of whom I am one, who have within the last thirty years, when we got these new lands, taken in and reclaimed new ground, which we have done our best to make productive, but we have no grass.",259,"John Mackenzie","Lewis, Breasclete",33
