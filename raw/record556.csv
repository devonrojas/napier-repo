"1","Captain THOMAS ANTHONY SWINBURNE, Royal Navy, Proprietor of Eilean Shona (63)—examined.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",1
"2","33210. The Chairman.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",2
"3","—Is Eilean Shona an island?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",3
"4","—Yes.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",4
"5","33211. How long has it been in the possession of your family?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",5
"6","—I bought it in 1852 or 1853. ",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",6
"7","33212. Have you built a residence?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",7
"8","—I added to the old residence. ",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",8
"9","33213. I believe you wish to make a statement regarding the fishing industry ; would you kindly make it ?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",9
"10","—When I first came to this country I found fishing going on to a certain extent, at certain times; but the general complaint was that there was no market. I took in hand the fishing of my own people, and fitted out better boats, and improved them, and saw that they had proper lines and gear to commence with. They fished during the cod season, which commences generally about February, and goes on till the latter end of April. They dry the cod, and I take fish at a certain rate, and provide salt and labour to cure the fish and send them south. I have had as much as sixteen tons, and sometimes the fish sell at £16 per ton or £20, or more; and by that the people make a good deal of money during that short season. I have also gone into the fishing much more extensively. During the time of the Rockall fishing I fitted out three vessels, and went out to Rockall, and afterwards I sent the vessels to Ireland, and if Government had looked after the banks then I think I should have made a good thing of it, and it would have peen a perpetual source of employment.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",10
"11","33214. Do you mean the banks at Rockall?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",11
"12","—Rockall principally, and also the banks from the Butt of Lewis to Barra Head; and the west side of the Long Island is lying waste, and unfished, although it is swarming with fish.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",12
"13","33215. You state that your first object was to supply the people with proper boats and tackle?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",13
"14","—Yes.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",14
"15","33216. What was the nature of the boat you supplied?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",15
"16","—A larger boat than they had—boats upwards of twenty feet in length.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",16
"17","33217. You did not supply them with any of the big boats with which we are familiar on the east coast?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",17
"18","—Not at first; I had the large boats afterwards.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",18
"19","33218. How far could they go with an open boat of twenty feet keel?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",19
"20","—They go out to the banks where the cod are found and near this off the Ardnamurchan coast from seven to eight miles off Shona, and sometimes the fish are pretty close to the point of Rhu.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",20
"21","33219. On what system did you supply the boats? Did you receive in the usual way half the catch, or did you make a present of the boats to the people, or sell them, or how?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",21
"22","—Various ways. With one boat I got a share of the catch, and another boat was supplied entirely to the people who were not well off, and in various ways ; but the way I have done usually has been to give a set price for the fish.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",22
"23","33220. Did you find that the people entered readily into your suggestions?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",23
"24","—Yes, the people of my own place, and of the next property to mine; and also, I think sometimes one or two boats across from Arisiag, and so on. I have odd boats from these places.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",24
"25","33221. Do you look upon the present type of big boat now coming into use as the proper definitive type of boat for the north of Scotland?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",25
"26","—Yes, you want a big fishing boat for the deep sea fishing.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",26
"27","33222. What tonnage?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",27
"28","—The tonnage is a very difficult thing to say, but I should say the dimensions of a boat would be about 60 feet in length, by 16 feet or 17 feet beam; in fact, the largest class of boats about Buckie",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",28
"29","and so on, is the class of boats wanted.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",29
"30","33223. I don't think we have seen anything above 52 feet?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",30
"31","—Yes, but the mean over all, and these Buckie boats run a great deal more overall.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",31
"32","33224. Is 52 feet keel is the type you mean?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",32
"33","—Yes.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",33
"34","33225. Would you state the cost of the boat and tackle, and gear of every description necessary for herring fishing?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",34
"35","—From £400 to £500.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",35
"36","33226. Is such a boat equally useful for the deep sea line fishing?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",36
"37","—Yes.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",37
"38","33227. Is such a boat capable of being fitted for both fishings ?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",38
"39","—Yes.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",39
"40","33228. Have you any such boat now?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",40
"41","—Not in my own possession, but I have built such a boat",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",41
"42","33229. You suggested something about Ireland?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",42
"43","—After the Rockall fishing was getting slack I sent two vessels to Ireland, and they brought home a good cargo of fish; but it was too late in the season to dry the fish properly.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",43
"44","33230. What kind of fish?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",44
"45","—Cod principally, and also herring, which I hear has since become a great industry in Ireland. I had very few nets; herring were merely caught as bait for the cod.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",45
"46","33231. Do you think, generally speaking, that the seafaring population on this side of the country might become as expert fishermen as the east country people if they had boats and tackle?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",46
"47","—I don't see why they should not. At the time when I was working with my three vessels I had Orkney men, Shetland men, and one crew from Grimsby, and I found some of my own men did just as welL Latterly I had a whole crew of my own men.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",47
"48","33232. When we saw the fishery at Barra this year, there were hardly any large boats belonging to the west country people in the herring fleet?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",48
"49","—Yes, I know they have a peculiar class of boats there, the Barra skiff, and they use them principally for night line fishing for cod outside of Barra.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",49
"50","33233. Is there any suggestion you are able to make at this moment which Government might consider in regard to the encouragement of the fisheries? Is there any form in which Government could advance boats, or money for the purchase of boats, to the people, with a fair chance of  r recovering the outlay?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",50
"51","—The greater number of the people are now so very poor that it would be a long time before there could be any repayment; but when men have a little money they are very glad, I think, to get boats. My own tenants have now two very good boats which they have bought for themselves; but they had something to commence with. I think if Government found out from the proprietors that there was an inclination for fishing, and so on, they might advance a certain sum for boats, and be repaid in the course of a certain number of years.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",51
"52","33231. Would the proprietor be inclined to make himself in any degree responsible for the repayment?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",52
"53","—That I cannot say. If I were in that position I should be glad to do so; but I cannot speak for other propietors.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",53
"54","33235. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",54
"55","—You referred to some want of action on the part of the Government which prevented your attempt to fish at Rockall being successful?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",55
"56","—Yes, the fishing ground was overcrowded. The offal of the fish was thrown overboard, and vessels, instead of standing off from the fishing ground, cleaned their fish there, bringing sharks and big fish, and utterly destroying the fishing. Instead of being full of cod, it became full of big fish and sharks. If the vessels had been compelled to leave the fishing ground, and clean the fish in deep water, that would not have happened.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",56
"57","33236. Is there any Rockall fishing now?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",57
"58","—Not to any extent; I never hear of it.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",58
"59","33237. You think if Government took charge of the boats there, it would be a great source of revenue?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",59
"60","—I do.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",60
"61","33238. You mentioned that there were good banks from the Butt of Lewis to Barrahead?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",61
"62","—Yes.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",62
"63","33239. Have you seen them fished?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",63
"64","—I have fished them there myself. ",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",64
"65","33240. Do you know if any of the long island boats fish there?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",65
"66","—The Barra sixerns' go out to a certain extent. I don't think there are any from Uist, Benbecula, or North Uist; but boats went from Loch Roag and Berneray. I believe it was first commenced there by an Englishman named Robinson, who went round in a Gravesend smack. He found the fishing good, and remained in the country, and bought a good-sized boat and got a crew of Highlanders and commenced the fishing. When I was there a few years ago there were several good-sized boats fishing there from Loch Roag, and I believe they did well.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",66
"67","33241. And you think the fishing might be extended so as to occupy the people from this district?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",67
"68","—Yes.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",68
"69","33242. Where would they cure their fish?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",69
"70","—Glendale, in Skye, is, I think, the best place. They would have to come through the Sound of Harris.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",70
"71","33243. Would they do that every day?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",71
"72","—No, once a week or so. I had a store there, at Hamara. There is plenty of beach for drying fish; I had",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",72
"73","that place myself. I used to work at Rockall, and come in through the Sound of Harris.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",73
"74","33244. Do you think the boats would fish provided there was a curing place at Glendale?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",74
"75","—Yes, but no doubt there are other places. That place was enlarged for me; but I believe Carloway, at the other side of Lewis, is a good place. That could be still more enlarged, and possibly at Eilan Monach, at the back of North Uist; and there might be other places. Barra, at Kessimull Bay, would be a good station, or at North Bay. The back of Lewis is very flat and bad for fishing.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",75
"76","33245. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",76
"77","—Have you any crofters on your estate?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",77
"78","—Yes, two good-sized tenants, and about ten crofters.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",78
"79","33246. Are they able to get their subsistence from the land, or must they fish?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",79
"80","—Scarcely from the land; some of them can make a livelihood by that, but they all do other work.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",80
"81","33247. You made use of the expression that a great number of people were now so very poor that they could not purchase boats to fish. Why are they so poor?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",81
"82","—Because they have not had employment, or because the crofts are too small, or something of that sort. I don't know exactly the occasion of their poverty.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",82
"83","33248. But you suggest these two causes as probable?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",83
"84","—Yes.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",84
"85","33249. Insufficiency of land and?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",85
"86","—Yes, and insufficiency of work. I think also that the oysters and mussels would be a great source of wealth and employment in this country. There are lochs all over the west coast, with a very fine climate, where oysters are to be found, to a certain extent, and mussels; but they are not looked after or cultivated. If the landlords had the sole right of the fore-shores, and were to look after their foreshores, that would be a great source of wealth and employment of a description suitable for the people who gather whelks and so on. They might look after the oyster and mussel beds, and it would pay better than anything I know of here. There are miles of the sea coast fitted for oyster and mussel cultivation.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",86
"87","33250. The Chairman.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",87
"88","—Has there been at one time a much larger stock of oysters and mussels on these beds than there is now?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",88
"89","—Oysters decidedly. They are taken away by strangers.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",89
"90","33251. It would, I presume, be necessary, in the first instance to have a period of very strict preservation?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",90
"91","—Decidedly.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",91
"92","33252. Would that be sufficient, or would it be necessary to replenish the beds?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",92
"93","—I think it would be necessary now to replenish in some places; they would have to be imported at first to commence new plantations. Mussels could be put on some of them. Although there is not such a run upon them as upon oysters, still they might be planted to a large extent. They are very valuable upon the east coast; but here they are not thought anything of.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",93
"94","33253. Is anything done on the east coast to keep up the stock?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",94
"95","—Yes, there are regular mussel beds at most of the large fishing places; and many parts of this coast are just the very thing for it. There is another thing—the lobster fishing. When I came here at first I used to work the lobster industry ; but I found that the supply was falling off. There is a Scottish law which forbids fishing between certain dates; I stuck to the law, while others fished all the year round, especially in the summer time, and that, I think, should be prevented. In a few years there will be no lobsters at all.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",95
"96","33254. We ate two lobsters to-day?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",96
"97","—Then you are lucky; in a few years you will not.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",97
"98","33255. Ought this present time to be made a close time?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",98
"99","—Yes, I think it should.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",99
"100","33256. Professor Markinnon.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",100
"101","—The law makes the close time from the 1st of June to the 1st of September?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",101
"102","—Yes.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",102
"103","33257. But it is never observed?",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",103
"104","—No, I don't think it is. There is a great deal of fishing to be done on this coast; I have gone into it largely myself, and I know that there is a great deal to be done. I have not sufficient capital to continue what I have begun, but there is enough work in that direction to employ all the surplus population on the west coast.",556,"Captain Thomas Anthony Swinburne, Royal Navy","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",104
