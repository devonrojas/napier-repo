"11","28100. Did any of your neighbours agree to pay this rise?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",11
"12","—The road was not put there by the time I left; but it is there now. All the neighbours payed additional rent; they were obliged to, I built a house and barn and a byre at my own expense, and they have now made a kennel of the byre and the gamekeeper occupies the house.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",12
"13","28101. Was it in consequence of your improvements that the rent was raised ?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",13

"15","28102. Did your neighbours who had not made improvements have the same rise of rent imposed?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",15

"21","28105. Is it more easy to make your living that way than the way you did before ?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",21

"23","28106. Your complaint is that you did not get compensation ?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",23
"24","—Yes, that is my complaint. I said I would take the windows and door which I brought from Glasgow, and I was threatened with the police.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",24
"25","28107. The Chairman.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",25
"26","—I wish to know how much money you laid out upon the house and offices in improvements altogether?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",26

"31","—I am not very well able to give it in money —ten barrels of lime and thirty battens about 11 feet long.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",31
"32","28110. Who supplied the slate?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",32
"33","—The houses were thatched. I bought iron and sacking from Glasgow, and the windows and doors.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",33
"34","28111. If you laid out £40 yourself, do you think the materials you received from the proprietor were worth £20 ?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",34
"35","—No, not £5.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",35
"36","28112. You paid £40, and perhaps the proprietor paid £5?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",36
"37","—I paid £40 myself ; I cannot say what the proprietor paid.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",37
"38","28113. When you determined to expend this sum of money in building a new house did you ask the factor for any security of tenure, or any compensation ? did you ever ask for a lease ?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",38

"41","—No, nor any upon the estate. ",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",41
"42","28115. Did any one you know ever ask for or receive any compensation for improvements on leaving their holding?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",42
"43","—I cannot tell. I only knew about my own property.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",43
"44","28116. Did you leave the place with very great reluctance?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",44
"45","—I was obliged to go where I could get food and clothes, but I may say it was the dearest spot on earth to me.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",45
"46","28117. Was there any cause of fault or dissatisfaction between you and the factor besides the question of the house ? ",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",46
"47","—No, there was no reason at all except that I could not make a livelihood there. I had no quarrel with",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",47
"48","the factor.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",48
"49","28118. You are now upon the land of Mr Fowler; have you got a house from Mr Fowler ?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",49

"54","—I am quite satisfied with them—both with the wages and with the master.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",54
"55","28121. Comparing your situation as labourer with a good landlord, and your situation as crofter before your rent was raised, whether would you prefer to be a labourer or a crofter ",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",55
"56","—' The flag at the doorstep of the great house is slippery.' [A Gaelic proverb meaning —he had more security where he was before.]",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",56
"57","28122. Do you consider that as a crofter you had a higher social position than as a mere labourer?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",57
"58","—There was such a time, but it is gone; now respect is given to the man that has means.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",58
"59","28123. Do the people of the country consider the crofter who has land, above the man who depends upon his daily wages, or do they not ?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",59
"60","—When I had a croft I was a greater slave than I am now.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",60

"68","—What was the first rent you were paying?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",68
"69","—£ 4, 17s.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",69
"70","28128. What was asked of you ?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",70
"71","—29s. more",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",71
"72","28129. You are paying now Is. 6d. a week —do you know how much that is a year ?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",72
"73","—It will come to about £4.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",73
"74","28130. Is that a cheap rent?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",74
"75","—Yes, when I get work.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",75

"77","—But I must work.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",77
"78","28132. If you got back your old place at your old rent to-morrow, would you go back ? the place was dear to you; is it not so yet ?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",78
"79","—It was about seventy-five years since tenants came to that place and they never put a road in, but when the gamekeepers came they put a road to the house at once.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",79
"80","28133. What is it you want now? are you satisfied now to remain where you are if you get the value of your improvements ?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",80
"81","—Yes, if I would get them I would never go back.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",81
"82","28134. Until there be new rules?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",82
"83","—Yes.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",83
"84","28135. And the old rent?",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",84
"85","—Many a time they alter the rent. When they gave the land to Mr Mackenzie who had the running of the mail here, each tenant was obliged to give thirty creels of peats in the year to him. Now. our people not being conveniently situated for these peats, had to pay the money. Then, when this practice stopped, those who were down for a money payment continued to pay it as rent when they ceased to pay it as peats. That was a grievance. When the rule came upon the estate that a pound was to be paid for every horse that was kept, horses were so thick about the place that many a time I would have to chase them away before I could get a cow out of the byre.",469,"Alexander Grant","Ross-shire, Ullapool",85
