"17","3256. What is the chief cause of the bad attendance?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",17
"18","—Well, there are many obstacles. I think that on account of the frequent changes of teachers the parents have been dissatisfied until I came, and since I came the average attendance has been higher than ever it was before. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",18
"19","3257. Have any of them complained that they are too far from the school ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",19

"37","3266. Does he visit frequently ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",37
"38","—I think so. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",38
"39","3267. Have there been any cases reported to the board of non-attendance ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",39
"40","—Many cases. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",40
"41","3268. And what has the board done ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",41
"42","—The board has done nothing, to my knowledge. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",42
"43","3269. Then the people find they can either send their children to school or not?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",43
"44","—It appears so. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",44
"45","3270. Do they complain of the fees?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",45
"46","—They do, and the fees are very small. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",46
"47","3271. What are the fees?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",47
"48","—Is. a quarter is the lowest. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",48
"49","3272. For what?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",49

"52","3273. Professor Mackinnon.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",52
"53","—Does that include specific subjects?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",53
"54","—No; the Board cannot make any arrangements for these. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",54
"55","3274. Who does?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",55
"56","—I do. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",56
"57","3275. What are they?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",57
"58","—I just make them according to the branches taught. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",58
"59","3276. Sheriff Nicolson.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",59
"60","—What is the average fee for Latin, Greek, or mathematics -The average fee for the higher branches is 5s., but for extra branches and for everything, 7s. 6d. per quarter, which is not too high for the country. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",60
"61","3277. What proportion have you attending these higher branches ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",61
"62","—Six out of the number; that is one-tenth ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",62
"63","3278. Do you consider that a fair proportion?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",63
"64","—No. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",64
"65","3279. To what class of life do these pupils, who take the higher branches, belong ? Are they the children of crofters ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",65
"66","—Partly. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",66
"67","3280. How many ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",67
"68","—Two or three. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",68

"70","—Latin, French, Euclid, algebra, drawing, and other common subjects. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",70
"71","3282. Professor Mackinnon.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",71
"72","—All for 7s. 6d. a quarter ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",72
"73","—Yes",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",73
"74","3283. The Chairman,",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",74
"75","—Are the fees for the higher branches regulated by authority, or are they left entirely to you?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",75
"76","—They are left to the teacher, because the board has no power to fix the fees above the standards. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",76
"77","3284. When the board fixes the fees, I suppose the fees are paid to the teacher ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",77
"78","—Yes; but the board are responsible; they are bound to pay me the entire amount of fees. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",78
"79","3285. Are there any arrears of fees ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",79
"80","—There are a few. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",80
"81","3286. Sheriff Nicolson,",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",81
"82","—Is Gaelic used in the school in teaching?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",82
"83","—No. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",83
"84","3287. You do not speak it?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",84
"85","—No, I do not speak it, and therefore cannot teach Gaelic. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",85
"86","3288. Do you find that any hindrance ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",86
"87","—It is no barrier. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",87
"88","3289. Do all the children speak English ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",88
"89","—More or less, the whole of them understand it. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",89
"90","3290. The Chairman.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",90
"91","—Is music taught ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",91
"92","—It is. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",92
"93","3291. Have you any instrument?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",93
"94","—I have no instrument except my voice. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",94
"95","3292. Are you well supplied with apparatus and maps and everything necessary for teaching ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",95
"96","—Yes, fully supplied. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",96
"97","3293. Have you held a school in the Lowlands ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",97
"98","—I have. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",98
"99","3294. Do you find the children here equally apt for learning?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",99
"100","—No, I don't. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",100
"101","3295. To what do you attribute that ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",101
"102","—Native habits. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",102
"103","3296. May it not be that they are not equally well acquainted with the English language ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",103
"104","—Partly so. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",104
"105","3297. Would it be agreeable to the people for their children to be also taught in Gaelic 1",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",105
"106","—I believe it would. I think some of them expressed a wish for a Gaelic teacher here. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",106
"107","3298. Sheriff Nicolson.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",107
"108","—I suppose you mean a teacher who understands Gaelic?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",108
"109","—Exactly. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",109
"110","3299. Mr Cameron.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",110
"111","—Do you find any difficulty in explaining to the children in English when they themselves talk Gaelic ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",111
"112","—They don't talk Gaelic to me. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",112
"113","3300. Do you find any difficulty in making them understand what you say?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",113
"114","—No, I find no difficulty. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",114
"115","3301. Do the children assist their parents at all in the work of their crofts ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",115
"116","—Decidedly, and they stay away from school on purpose to do that. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",116
"117","3302. That keeps them away from school ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",117
"118","—Yes, for a month or six weeks. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",118
"119","3303. At what time do they stay away ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",119
"120","—Just a little before this time ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",120
"121","—six weeks before this time. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",121
"122","3304. What are they doing?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",122
"123","—Working on the ground assisting in tillage. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",123
"124","3305. Planting potatoes ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",124
"125","—Probably that was part of it. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",125
"126","3306. And keeping cows?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",126
"127","—Yes, and a few of the younger members of the family keeping the houses. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",127
"128","3307. Mr Cameron.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",128
"129","—We have heard that some of the crofters are in the habit of tethering their cows. Have you found that, instead of doing that, they use children to herd them ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",129
"130","—Well, I cannot enter into that, because I was not there to see; but it is possible that it would be done. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",130
"131","—Well, I cannot say what work they do specifically. But I know they are absent from school, and that many of them are absent when they ought to be present. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",131
"132","3309. What time of the year are they chiefly absent besides spring?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",132
"133","— Well, they are very irregular. The habits of the people here are not regular at all, and the attendance of the children has been very irregular in consequence, I am sorry to say; but I think the people are kindly disposed to the teacher, and that they wish him well. If he is very strict or rigorous they think he is inimical or unfriendly to them, and they requite mistaken if they do, because he is only acting up to what the Government demands, and what the law enacts. I can assure you, that it is a very difficult thing to please the Government inspector, who is very strict of course, and the people, on the other hand, are certainly not strict; and the teacher, between the two fires, what can he do? ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",133
"134","3310. The Chairman.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",134
"135","—But in cases of irregularity, do you not sometimes speak to the parents yourself?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",135
"136","—I have gone and visited them, and remonstrated with them, but still they just lapse into their old habits, and they forget what is due to duty, and the demands of duty. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",136
"137","3311. Mr Cameron.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",137
"138","—Have they ever expressed to you the necessity of their children helping them in their crofts as an excuse for not sending them to school ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",138
"139","—They don't seem to see a necessity of that kind, but just on the spur of the moment they take the child away. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",139
"140","3312. Do they give you no reason?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",140
"141","—-No reason, and no warning. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",141
"142","3313. And when you ask them do they give a reason ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",142
"143","—They say the child has been taken away for this or that, but that does not include a reason ; it is simply a statement. There is no reason about it. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",143
"144","3314. Professor Mackinnon.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",144
"145","—You stated the children are not so apt to learn as the children in the south. Do you mean they are not so clever naturally ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",145
"146","—I certainly mean that they are not so capable. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",146
"147","3315. That they are deficient in intellectual ability, for example?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",147
"148","— Well, certainly they must be. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",148
"149","3316. I think you also stated you had no difficulty in explaining to them a lesson in English. Did you find they had any difficulty in understanding your explanation ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",149
"150","—Not much difficulty. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",150
"151","3317. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",151
"152","—How many have you in the 5th and 6th standards ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",152
"153","—Five. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",153
"154","3318. Are there any girls among them?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",154
"155","—Not one. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",155
"156","3319. If there were girls in the 5th and 6th standards, should you teach them domestic economy ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",156
"157","—Certainly. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",157
"158","3320. And would they then pay fees as for specific subjects ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",158
"159","—No. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",159
"160","3321. Then there are some specific subjects which they get without paying extra fee ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",160
"161","—Certainly. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",161
"162","3322. What does that include besides domestic economy ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",162
"163","—Do you mean the girls ? ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",163
"164","3323. Are there any special subjects besides domestic economy taught free?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",164
"165","—No, the boys pay for the extra subjects. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",165
"166","3324. But the girls do not pay for domestic economy?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",166
"167","—Certainly not. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",167
"168","3325. Do you find the children here are well supplied with class books? ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",168
"169","—Yes. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",169
"170","3326. Do they learn their lessons at home ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",170
"171","—No. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",171
"172","3327. Is that one of the causes why they don't progress so well as children in the south ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",172
"173","—It is. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",173
"174","3328. And that is an evil habit of the country?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",174
"175","—It is. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",175
"176","3329. Of course agricultural half-timers are recognised. Do you think that these children when absent are usually usefully employed at home ? ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",176
"177","—Well, I think some of them are uselessly at home—not usefully employed. They are kept at home without a proper reason. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",177
"178","3330. You think, that on the whole, the children are fairly clothed ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",178
"179","— They are. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",179
"180","3331. Sufficiently clothed for attending in the bad weather of winter? ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",180
"181","—They are. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",181
"182","3332. You don't see great signs of poverty in the clothing of the children ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",182
"183","—I do not. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",183
"184","3333 Are they well shod ? Well, they come bare-footed. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",184
"185","3334. In summer?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",185
"186","—In winter. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",186
"187","3335. And they don't object to go to school in winter because they are bare-footed?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",187
"188","—No, because those who have boots go without them in winter. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",188
"189","3336. And you don't object?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",189
"190","—I cannot object, I have no reason to meddle with these things. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",190
"191","3337. The Chairman.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",191
"192","—Do the children usually bring something to eat with them ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",192
"193","—Well, I cannot say, for I do not see them eating. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",193
"194","3338. But your natural curiosity might lead you to investigate; you might know to some extent ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",194
"195","—I have often told them if they were hungry to go into my house, and only some went. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",195
"196","3339. But the question is whether their parents are able to supply them with some food to bring to the school?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",196
"197","—Yes, quite. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",197
"198","3340. Do they, then, habitually bring a piece ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",198
"199","—I suppose they do, because they don't go home to dinner, and therefore they must have their dinner in their pockets. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",199
"200","3341. Do you know what they usually bring?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",200
"201","—Oat cake, and a bit of cheese, when they can get it. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",201
"202","3342. Do they bring any milk?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",202
"203","—They don't bring any flasks or bottles that I have seen. They drink water. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",203
"204","3343. Do you think they are worse provided than the peasantry of the Lowlands in that way ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",204
"205","—According to the climate, and according to their habits, I think.not. They can endure a great deal more than I could have endured when I was like them, because I was not brought up in the same way. They are indurated to the island of Skye, which I never was. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",205
"206","3344. Do you think that the general habits of the people arc much hardier and poorer with reference to diet than those of the peasantry of the Lowlands ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",206
"207","—Well, I don't think, comparatively speaking, that they are poorer. I have been in Sutherlandshire, and I know Sutherlandshire very well, and I have found many poorer people there whose children were attending school regularly, and whose fees were paid, and they were not so well attended to nor so well kept up as the children here, as even the very poorest of them are. Comparatively speaking, the children of Skye, so far as I have seen, are not below the average, but I would say rather above. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",207
"208","3345. Physically ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",208
"209","—Well, I would say in point of cleanliness, for the children here, that come into school when you like you will find them very clean. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",209
"210","3346. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",210
"211","—You were asked to compare the children of Skye with those of the Lowlands, and you answered for Sutherlandshire, but his Lordship meant southern counties ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",211
"212","—I said rather above the average. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",212
"213","3347. Why do you jump into Sutherlandshire ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",213
"214","—I was comparing Highlands with Highlands. I cannot compare Highlands with Lowlands. I said they were rather above the average in contrast with Sutherland. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",214
"215","3348. Can you contrast the Highlands with the Lowlands?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",215
"216","—Yes, because the one is high and the other low. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",216
"217","3349. The Chairman.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",217
"218","—May I take the liberty to ask you where does your experience lie in the Lowlands ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",218
"219","—In Stirlingshire. I was born at Bridge of Allan. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",219
"220","3350. Then do you consider that the physical condition of the children here is equal to that of the children of the labourers and peasantry there ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",220
"221","—I do. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",221
"222","3351. Both with reference to dress and diet?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",222
"223","—Everything except in attendance at school. They are certainly not equal there. As I stated, there is a lapse of attendance at this place. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",223
"224","3352. Sheriff Nicolson.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",224
"225","—But what of their mental faculty ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",225
"226","—I cannot account for mental faculty. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",226
"227","3353. Do you consider their mental faculty or talent to be inferior to that of children in any other place ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",227
"228","—I do not know in regard to any other place, but the calibre is certainly below that of the Lowlands. ",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",228
"229","3354. The mental calibre ?",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",229

"234","—You mentioned that the children do not receive as much instruction at home as they do in the Lowlands.

"242","—Summary of H.M Inspectors Report, October 9, 1882. The same old story has to be again repeated for this school. A new teacher appointed since the last inspection. The present master has been in charge since the month of April last only. The order is good, but the school is as a whole in a very moderate condition. The wall plaster requires to be repaired, and the room should be at once whitewashed. After the warning given last year, the grant was reduced under article 32 B for faults of instruction. The frequent change of teachers is to be regretted. My Lords trust that the defects mentioned by H.M. Inspector will be remedied without delay.",55,"Duncan Stewart","Skye, Waternish",242
