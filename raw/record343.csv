"21","—Originally the rent was about £5 exclusive of the taxes.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",21
"22","19066. You don't consider that the rent is high, do you?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",22
"23","—If it were not for the taxes, I would not The valuation is £4, 18s. 6d.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",23
"24","19067. What is it that the people have got to say generally?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",24
"25","—The think their taxes heavy, and they would like their houses put in better condition; if the houses are out of condition, the proprietor is not willing to put them in order. If the proprietor repairs them, he lays something on the rent on that account. We would wish thatch roofs to be done away with and to have felt or canvas. We would wish a house 30 feet long, 12 feet or 13 feet wide, by 7 feet in the walls. The houses are too small.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",25
"26","19068. Seven feet of thickness of wall?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",26
"27","—No ; 7 feet high.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",27
"28","19069. You consider a felt roof superior to a thatch roof?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",28
"29","—Far superior.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",29
"30","19070. If you had a lease of your land, could you undertake the putting of the house in order yourselves ?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",30
"31","—We would put the inside in order, if the walls and roof were put on. The occupants would put the",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",31
"32","inside to their own satisfaction.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",32
"33","19071. Was that an old fashion of the country, that the proprietor should make up the outside and the tenant the inside?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",33
"34","—-Yes, it has been so in all my time.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",34
"35","19072. I suppose you have been upon this estate all your life?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",35
"36","—Yes.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",36
"37","19073. And your father before you?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",37
"38","—Yes.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",38
"39","19074. The taxes you consider too high are the school rates and the poor rates?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",39
"40","—Yes, and there is 15 s. in addition laid upon our land on account of the fences betwixt the property belonging to our proprietor and the next proprietor, a fence which was partly forced, because our proprietor did not wish the fence to be raised at all. There was 15s. laid upon our croft to defray that.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",40
"41","19075. Has that fence done any good to you?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",41
"42","—No, rather an injury, because our small sheep go through the fence, and that creates bad feeling, and we are threatened with having our sheep poinded.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",42
"43","19076. And are there big sheep on the other side?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",43
"44","—Yes.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",44
"45","19077. And they cannot come over to you?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",45
"46","—No, it requires a small fence to prevent the small sheep from coming through. But there is another annoyance, and that is caused by the roads running through the town, the gates being left open. We have been very much annoyed and injured, when our crops were on the ground, by animals coming in during the night and destroying our crops.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",46
"47","19078. The road goes through the arable ground?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",47
"48","—Yes, and passengers travelling with carriages leave the gates open, and the animals come in, so that we are very much annoyed and injured.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",48
"49","19079. The gates are pretty numerous upon the roads in Mid Yell?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",49
"50","—Yes.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",50
"51","19080. It is the school rate and the poor rate that are so very high?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",51
"52","—Very high.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",52
"53","19081. How could you manage to reduce the school rate?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",53
"54","—I could not say.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",54
"55","19082. I suppose you want to have the schools?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",55
"56","—We need the schools.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",56
"57","19083. Do the children go well to the school?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",57
"58","—In some cases they might turn out better, but they attend more regularly than they did at first.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",58
"59","19084. Are the people anxious that the children should go to school? ",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",59
"60","—Some are and others are not. Those who have not had the benefit of education themselves don't feel the necessity as much as the others. ",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",60
"61","19085. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",61
"62","—Have you a felt or a canvas roof?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",62
"63","—There is a felt roof on our house, put on at our own expense.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",63
"64","19086. If it were once put on, would the tenant keep it tarred?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",64
"65","—Yes, the tenant would guarantee to keep it in order.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",65
"66","19087. Do you know how long the felt roof lasts ?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",66
"67","—I am hardly able to say. I suppose, if well cared for, it will last for a lifetime.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",67
"68","19088. What is the greatest experience you have had of these roofs ?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",68
"69","—I have only had a little experience for a few years, but we have found the benefit of it. It is much lighter for the walls, and it is tight, and we have not the bother of putting up a thatch roof.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",69
"70","19089. How long is it since felt roofs were introduced?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",70
"71","—It is long since they began with some individuals, but they are not numerous yet.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",71
"72","19090. What is the oldest you know of?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",72
"73","—I am hardly able to say. In North Yell, I believe, they have had some for a number of years. But that has not been on a dwelling house —only a house used as a store.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",73
"74","19091. Do you line the roof below the rafters?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",74
"75","—When we wish to make a comfortable room upstairs we line it.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",75
"76","19092. But if it is only a single floor, you don't line it?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",76
"77","—No, if we are not going to make a particularly comfortable room, we don't line it; but if we wish to make it anything comfortable we do.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",77
"78","19093. Is the house not very cold if it is not lined?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",78
"79","—Yes. The house I occupy is all lined with wood along the wall in one end, and a wooden floor. It is not uncommon, that, in many houses. ",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",79
"80","19094. But if a felt roof is not lined, is it not peculiarly cold in winter?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",80
"81","—Yes, in winter time, and it is very warm in summer.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",81
"82","19095. You mentioned you had a complaint about the erection of the fence on the march between your proprietor and a neighbouring proprietor; who is the neighbouring proprietor?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",82
"83","—Mr John Harrison.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",83
"84","19096. Who is your proprietor?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",84
"85","—Mrs Budge.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",85
"86","19097. If this fence had been made so as to keep in your sheep, would not that have been of mutual advantage?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",86
"87","—Yes, it would have been.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",87
"88","19098. And did you represent to Lady Budge at the time the fence was made that it ought to be made so as to keep sheep in?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",88
"89","—Lady Budge had no power at that time, it was old John Walker.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",89
"90","19099. Did you represent that to John Walker?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",90
"91","—No.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",91
"92","19100. Do you think, if you had represented it to him, he would have seen that the fence was so erected that it would keep in your sheep?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",92
"93","—I could not say; he was a very stiff kind of man.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",93
"94","19101. In regard to the gates you spoke of, would it be of any use to fence the roadsides where there is arable land so as to keep sheep out of it?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",94
"95","—It would be. It is in the night time, when the gates are left open, that the sheep get in and the injury is done. Sheep and cattle come in to our corn land and do great injury.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",95
"96","19102. What remedy is possible for it?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",96
"97","—I don't know, unless there were restrictions laid on travellers that they must shut the gates.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",97
"98","19103. Have you any other complaints to make?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",98
"99","—Nothing in particular. I have no complaints to make against our proprietor; she is a very nice sort of woman.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",99
"100","19104. Is there anything you would like to see done for the land?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",100
"101","—No, only I would like that something should be done to the houses we dwell in.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",101
"102","19105. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",102
"103","—You stated that the fence you referred to was put up at the instance of the other proprietor?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",103
"104","—Yes, our proprietor was very stiff against it, and was put into the Court of Session about it.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",104
"105","19106. Do you know the law about a mutual fence between two properties?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",105
"106","—The law about mutual fences is, I understand, that each one should pay a share.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",106
"107","19107. Do you know also that unless the fence is as good for the one as for the other he is not bound to pay for it?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",107
"108","—I did not know that.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",108
"109","19108. You had better go to the proprietrix and tell her you are anxious for a fence to keep your sheep out as well as the others ?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",109
"110","—They are trying just now to improve it by putting in an additional wire.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",110
"111","19109. The Chairman.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",111
"112","—Is there any other statement you wish to make?",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",112
"113","—Nothing in particular.",343,"Matthew Robertson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",113
