"1","WILLIAM M'LURE, Crofter, Glen Bernisdale—examined. See Appendix A. II",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",1
"2","640. The Chairman.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",2
"3","—What is your occupation?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",3
"4","—I work at the roads.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",4
"5","641. Have you a croft ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",5
"6","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",6
"7","642. You are a crofter, and work at the roads?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",7
"8","—Yes,",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",8
"9","643. Are you also a fisherman ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",9
"10","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",10
"11","644. Are you a native of this place ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",11
"12","—I was born in the parish of Strath. I live in Glen. Bernisdale.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",12
"13","645. Have you been freely elected by the crofters in this place to be their delegate ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",13
"14","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",14
"15","646. You are perfectly acquainted with their interests and their wishes ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",15
"16","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",16
"17","647. Will you be so good as to state what are the grievances or hardships, if any, of which they complain at this place?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",17
"18","—Any statement I make I would rather make in Gaelic. The first cause of the peoples' poverty that I can mention is the smallness of their holdings and the clearness of them, and that the soil is so poor that it does not yield crop. As a proof that our holdings are too small, our only implement of agriculture is & stick with a crook at the end of it. We call it a cas-chrom, and if the stick has not a natural bend we have to nail a piece to it Anyone capable of thinking must know that a man in two or three weeks cannot work sufficient ground with this implement to support a family of seven or eight. The place in which I reside was a pasturage that was taken from the people of Bernisdale forty-seven years ago. At that time twenty-four families were placed in the pasturage that was taken from the Bernisdale people, and what was habitable of it was made into lots, and we got a share of the hill that was taken from these people along with it. We had not that hill pasture long when the landlord took part of it away from us again.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",18
"19","648. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",19
"20","—Who was the landlord?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",20
"21","—Donald Macdonald, late of Tannara. He did not reduce our rents, but he gave us sea-weed as compensation for the hill pasture of which he had deprived us. He did not leave us the right of cutting sea-ware long before he charged us for it. The landlord then came to poverty, and he lost the estate, and was put under trustees, and when the trustees came into possession they made some reduction of our rents, but we continued to pay for the seaweed as we had been paying. When the late Mr Kenneth M'Leod of Grishornish got the property we got back the right to cut sea-ware free, but our present landlord makes us pay at present.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",21
"22","649. Who is your present landlord?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",22
"23","—Mr Lachlan Macdonald, Skeabost, We have, however, some sea-ware connected with our land free, but we pay for the rest. He commenced to make us pay for the seaweed when he was at law about the shore. He was preventing us from gathering shell-fish—oysters.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",23
"24","650. With whom was he at law ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",24
"25","—He was at law with one of his own tenants ; and he did what was worse to us than that at the time. There was a yair in the loch which was good for catching herring. I have seen in one night more than 300 barrels of herring caught in it. The loss of the yair was worse to us than anything that was done to us since we came to the place. The landlord ordered the yair to be destroyed, and the reason for that was that the people would be catching in the yair white fish,—salmon,—and since the destruction of the yair not one-fifth part of the quantity of fish that used to be caught in the river has been caught. I have not much more to say, but that the people are crowded upon each other here. Skeabost and Bernisdale fifty years ago were in a very prosperous condition. Since then the tenants were taken from Skeabost and located in Bernisdale. When the tenants were put out of Skeabost I had two lots. One of these was taken from me to accommodate another man. When the late Mr Kenneth M'Leod came into this property he laid five days' work upon each crofter. He did not long continue to exact this labour from them; but he laid an equivalent in money upon them— ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",25
"26","10s. upon each croft—and the payment of that sum in addition continued till last Martinmas, when the present proprietor gave us down that sum in name of reduction of rent. As there are other witnesses to speak after me, I have nothing further to say, unless I am questioned.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",26
"27","651. Have you any remedies to suggest whereby your condition, and that of your fellow crofters, might be improved ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",27
"28","—I do not think there can be a more suitable remedy than to get more land at a suitable rent, and security that we will not be evicted so long as we pay the rent, and compensation for improvement.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",28
"29","652. Anything else in the way of remedy?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",29
"30","—Hill pasture as well as arable land.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",30
"31","653. Is there any suitable land upon the estate, suited for this enlargement, for yourself and the other crofters?—There is not sufficient land for that purpose on thi3 property, to make comfortable the whole of the crofters upon it.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",31
"32","654. Are you a fisherman ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",32
"33","—I am not a fisherman.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",33
"34","655. Are any of the people here now engaged in fishing?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",34
"35","—Yes, down at Bernisdale there are fishermen.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",35
"36","656. Could the fishing be improved and developed if they had quays where they could run up their boats and take shelter?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",36
"37","—No doubt the fishing would be improved to those who are accustomed to fish, if they had quays.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",37
"38","657. Is this bay a good place for fishing?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",38
"39","—At one time it was a good place, but now it is not so good.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",39
"40","658. Can you explain why it has fallen off?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",40
"41","—I cannot answer that question.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",41
"42","659. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",42
"43","—Do I understand there were twenty-four families on this pasture ground to which you and the people alongside of you were moved twenty years ago?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",43
"44","—The pasturage was taken from the Bernisdale people, and twenty-four families were located on that pasturage.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",44
"45","660. Where did they come from, these twenty-four families?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",45
"46","—They came from different places.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",46
"47","661. Chiefly from where ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",47
"48","—That was before the people were removed from Skeabost at all.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",48
"49","662. Then, from what property did these twenty-four people come ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",49
"50","— From different properties. Most of them came from M'Leod of M'Leod's property.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",50
"51","663. Where did you come from? Did you come yourself or did your father come ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",51
"52","—I was born in the parish of Strath, and came here when I was about three years of age. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",52
"53","664. Your father came from the parish of Strath ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",53
"54","—Yes. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",54
"55","665. On Lord Macdonald's property ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",55
"56","—My mother was a widow woman, and the croft there was too heavy for her to keep, and she came to this quarter. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",56
"57","666. Whose property were you on at Strath?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",57
"58","—Lord Macdonald's property. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",58
"59","667. How many tenants were taken from Skeabost to Bernisdale?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",59
"60","—I cannot exactly say, but I think there were about twenty tenants in Skeabost the last time they were removed. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",60
"61","668. How long is it since their removal took place ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",61
"62","—I cannot say. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",62
"63","669. But you lost half of your land at that time, and you should know ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",63
"64","—It will be between seven and eight years, so far as I can mind. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",64
"65","670. And you lost half of your land at that time?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",65
"66","—Yes. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",66
"67","671. And your rent was paid at that time?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",67
"68","—Yes. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",68
"69","672. You had no difficulty in paying rent?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",69
"70","—Not at that time. Twenty families were removed from Skeabost. I do not know whether the whole of them were sent to Bernisdale or not. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",70
"71","673. And that land at Skeabost is now in the proprietor's own occupation ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",71
"72","—Yes, that land is now in the proprietor's own occupation. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",72
"73","674. He does not let any of it ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",73
"74","—No. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",74

"76","— It was called duty work. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",76
"77","676. What work was it ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",77
"78","—Any work he would have to do. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",78
"79","677. Such as ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",79
"80","—Working land, and whatever work he would have to do. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",80
"81","678. But was it for your benefit or for his ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",81
"82","—For his own benefit. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",82
"83","679. You did not make roads for yourselves or piers or anything of that sort?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",83
"84","—No. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",84
"85","680. Were you reaping crop for him?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",85
"86","—Yes. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",86
"87","681. You said that one of the remedies for your poverty would be an increased holding—have the people of Bernisdale sufficient means to stock increased holdings if you got holdings large enough to please you?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",87
"88","—Well, I believe they have not in the meantime, for what stock they have is not their own. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",88
"89","682. Is it not their own now ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",89
"90","—No. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",90
"91","683. Whose stock is it?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",91
"92","—It belongs to the merchants and to the proprietor. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",92
"93","684. In what way to the merchants ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",93
"94","—For meal. I was speaking to a man outside before I came in, and he told me he had upwards of £400 on the Skeabost estate for meal. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",94
"95","685. They are in debt to the merchants ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",95
"96","—Yes. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",96
"97","686. And how does it belong to the proprietor ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",97
"98","—For arrears of rent ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",98
"99","687. Were they ever clear of the merchants and the proprietor?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",99
"100","— Well, I cannot say whether they were all clear of rent, but I know they were not so much sunk as they are at present. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",100
"101","688. How long will it be since you think they were clear or nearly clear ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",101
"102","—About forty-six or forty-seven years ago—before the pasture was taken off. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",102

"106","—I did not hear of that.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",106
"107","691. How is your stock managed? Has it any common mark ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",107
"108","—We have a joint stock and mark ; and our summing of sheep in Bernisdale is sixteen sheep, and in Glen, where I live, it is eight sheep. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",108
"109","692. Are the sales made in common, or do you each sell your own ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",109
"110","— There are two managers of the whole of the stock—two of the crofters. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",110
"111","693. Are the stock sold in one lump, or does each man sell his own ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",111
"112","—It is sold in one lump. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",112
"113","694. And the money is divided?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",113
"114","—The money is divided. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",114

"119","697. Is that for the whole croft or the half?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",119
"120","—It is for the whole croft in the Glen. We have the same summing of cows as in Bernisdale, but they have double the summing of sheep. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",120
"121","698. And how many horses ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",121
"122"," —One or two, but the ground officer has two horses. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",122
"123","699. How much arable land have you ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",123
"124","—Well, I cannot tell the exact acreage, and in case it might be said afterwards that I gave false evidence, I would rather not say anything about that. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",124
"125","700. Do you know how many barrels of potatoes you plant each year?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",125

"128","—About two bolls. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",128
"129","702. What is a boll here?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",129
"130","—Six bushels. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",130
"131","703. Is that oats or barley ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",131
"132","—Oats. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",132
"133","704. Do you sow any barley ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",133
"134","—No barley; barley would not grow. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",134
"135","705. Nor bere ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",135
"136","—No, the soil being so poor. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",136
"137","706. What rent do you pay ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",137
"138","—Till last Martinmas I was paying £5, but when the 10s. for duty work was taken off me I only pay £4, 10s. now. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",138
"139","707. For the whole croft ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",139
"140","—For the whole croft ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",140
"141","708. You have then eight sheep, two cows, and two stirks, and land that will plant four or four and a half barrels of potatoes, and two bolls of six bushels—that is one and a half quarters—of oats; and the rent is £4, 10s. now?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",141
"142","—Yes. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",142
"143","709. Have you a full stock?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",143
"144","—Yes, but I buy from £2, 10s. to £3 worth of provender for winter, for the croft will not produce so much as will winter the two cows and two stirks.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",144
"145","710. Do you give the corn to the stirks along with the straw?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",145
"146","—I thresh some of the corn. Owing to the scarcity of it, I must give some to the cattle without threshing. It would be cheaper for me to buy seed oats.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",146
"147","711. How deep do you dig your crofts?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",147
"148","—In some places we cultivate the croft to the depth of 2 inches, and in some places to a depth of 1½ inch, and in some places perhaps 6 inches.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",148
"149","712. But you can get below 6 inches ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",149
"150","—No, it is seldom we can get that.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",150
"151","713. Would a spade go down deeper?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",151
"152","—A spade would not go through the rock.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",152
"153","714. But the rock is not in every place ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",153
"154","—Where there is no rock there is gravel.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",154
"155","715. A good deal of it might be drained, might it not?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",155
"156","—I believe it could be made better by improving it.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",156
"157","716. By trenching?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",157
"158","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",158
"159","717. And by draining ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",159
"160","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",160
"161","718. Does anybody in your place drain or trench at all?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",161
"162","—Well, have seen when trenching and draining were going on, but the result would he that they would be fined by the proprietor.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",162
"163","719. A rise of rent?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",163
"164","—A rise of rent; and if they refuse to give the rise of rent they would be deprived of their holding, and it would be given to some one else who would give the rise.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",164
"165","720. Do you remember how long it is since a case of that kind occurred ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",165
"166","—Well, it was not during this proprietor's reign, nor that of the proprietor before him.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",166
"167","721. Would the proprietor give you a lease? Did anybody ever ask for a lease ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",167
"168","—I believe they did, and he gave a lease to a few.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",168
"169","722. For what length of time ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",169
"170","—I think it was ten years.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",170
"171","723. Not more?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",171
"172","—Not more, but we could not improve the land, for the production of the land would not keep us during the time we would be improving it. We had to be at other work, to support our families.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",172
"173","724. But you are at home most of the winter?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",173
"174","—No, I cannot be at home any day I can work, owing to the kind of work I have.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",174
"175","725. What is the work ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",175
"176","—Keeping a piece of the road in repair.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",176
"177","726. You have constant employment",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",177
"178","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",178
"179","727. Mr Cameron.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",179
"180","—You say that no improvement has taken place on the land held by the crofters?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",180
"181","—Not of late.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",181
"182","728. How long ago is it since the last improvement was made? You say it was not in the time of the present landlord or the landlord before him ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",182
"183","—No, I do not think it was.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",183
"184","729. Can you fix any date?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",184
"185","—No, I cannot fix any date.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",185
"186","730. How many years is it since the last land was improved do you think ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",186
"187","—I believe it will be as far back as twenty years ago—at least no improvement I know of. There might be a little, but nothing worth speaking of.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",187
"188","731. And the people do not improve the land for fear the rent would be raised upon them ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",188
"189","—I know it was the case in former times.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",189
"190","732. But, if it is not the same proprietor that used to raise the rent upon them when they made improvements before, what is the cause of the fear of the people that the rent will now be raised ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",190
"191","—It is not the fear of making the improvements, but they cannot stay at home to make the improvements.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",191
"192","733. If you never tried the present proprietor to see if he would raise the rent upon you, why is it that the people are afraid to make improvements, for fear of the rent being raised ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",192
"193","—I have no doubt but this proprietor would allow compensation for improvements if the people could stay.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",193
"194","734. I am not speaking of the question of compensation for improvements, but you said the people would not improve the land for fear of the rent being raised, and you told us that that had not been done either during the present proprietor's time or his predecessor's, but that it was twenty years ago. Now why do not the people improve their land for fear of the rent being raised when they have had no experience of the rent being raised in the present proprietor's time?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",194
"195","—I know the present proprietor would not raise the rent.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",195
"196","735. Then you modify your answer, that the fear of having their rent raised influences them ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",196
"197","—It did in former times, but not now.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",197
"198","736. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",198
"199","—You said that you had constant employment, and therefore had not spare time to improve your croft. But your neighbours go away for work in the summer time, and are at ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",199
"200","home in winter, and if they are not afraid of having their rent raised, why is it they idle away their time and don't do something to improve the land?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",200
"201","—I did not say they idled away their time in the winter time.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",201
"202","737. But they are not generally away from home in the winter?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",202
"203","—No.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",203
"204","738. What are they doing?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",204
"205","—In the township where I live, some of them are in the service of the proprietor and some away working at other places They will be thinking that far better than improving the land.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",205
"206","739. Then, from the new year till they begin to crop the land, what are they doing?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",206
"207","—It is very seldom they can do any outside work in this quarter on account of the weather.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",207
"208","740. Mr Cameron.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",208
"209","—Now, coming to the question of compensation for improvements, you say you would like to have compensation promised for improvements?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",209
"210","—I do.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",210
"211","741. You have told us that for the last twenty years no improvements have been attempted ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",211
"212","—Not that I am aware of.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",212
"213","742. Do you think that improvements would have been attempted if there had been a reasonable prospect of compensation?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",213
"214","—Yes, and the holdings enlarged.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",214
"215","743. But if there had been reasonable prospect of compensation ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",215
"216","— Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",216
"217","744. Now, how would you propose that should be given ? In what form ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",217
"218","—Compensation when the present tenant would leave.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",218
"219","745. But would any of the present tenants ever be likely to leave ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",219
"220","— Well, I do not know; if they could find better places I believe they would.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",220
"221","746. I mean, of their own free will?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",221
"222","—Yes, if they could find better places, I am quite certain they would leave.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",222
"223","747. But in the actual condition of affairs in Skye, such as we find existing, would any of the crofters be likely, of their own free will, to leave, and therefore ask for compensation for having improved their land?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",223
"224","—That is a question I cannot answer.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",224
"225","748. Would they be likely to emigrate to America ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",225
"226","—They would get nothing in America but vacant land, and they have plenty of that in their own country.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",226
"227","749. But they would not like to go to America ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",227
"228","—No, they would not like to go to America. I know that.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",228
"229","750. Then how would occasion arise to get compensation if the people do not leave ? You were asked just now the remedies you would suggest for the existing state of things now complained of, and you suggest that one of the remedies would be compensation for improvements. You first told us that no improvements have been made here for the last twenty years, and that when I asked you when compensation should be given, you did not seem to know exactly ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",229
"230","—Yes, fixity of tenure and compensation for any improvements.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",230
"231","751. But we want to know what you, as representing the crofters, actually wish? We do not want the mere catch words ""fixity of tenure"" and "" compensation for improvements;"" but we want, being on the spot here, to find out exactly what it is you want now, with regard to this compensation, if you went away it would be reasonable to expect you should get compensation ; but suppose the crofters do not leave the country of their own free will, in what way would you wish the proprietor to give you compensation, or how would you bring it about ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",231
"232","—By giving me a reduction of rents according to the work I did.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",232
"233","752. That is to say, for every acre of land you improved, he should give you a reduction on the old rent ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",233
"234","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",234
"235","753. Of course, I was talking of your going away of your own free will. I suppose you are not afraid here of being arbitrarily evicted? ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",235
"236","—No.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",236
"237","754 Would you like to have fixity of tenure, or leases?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",237
"238","—It is all the same,—fixity of tenure or perpetual.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",238
"239","755. Long leases ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",239
"240","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",240
"241","756. What do you call a sufficiently long lease?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",241
"242","—Thirty or forty years.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",242
"243","757. Are you and your neighbours in fear of being arbitrarily evicted by the present proprietor ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",243
"244","—No.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",244
"245","758. But you think, viewing the possibility of another proprietor or somebody in whom you would not have the same confidence, you would like to have long leases ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",245
"246","—We would.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",246
"247","759. Would you like more land ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",247
"248","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",248
"249","760. Now, how do you propose to stock that land ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",249
"250","—Well, we could not stock the land in our present position, but through time we would be able to stock the land if we got it.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",250
"251","761. But how would you do in the meantime?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",251
"252","—We were thinking Government would be allowing some money to improve the land, and that we would try some other means of stocking it.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",252
"253","762. What other means could you try? Would the merchants allow you any more money ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",253
"254","—The bank might allow us money, and get the stock for security.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",254
"255","763. The bank might advance the money ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",255
"256","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",256
"257","764. Sheriff Nicolson.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",257
"258","—But does not the stock already belong to the laird and the merchants ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",258
"259","—This is new stock.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",259
"260","765. Mr Cameron.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",260
"261","—Do you think the bank would advance you money to stock a farm when they knew that the stock you already had was mortgaged to the merchants ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",261
"262","—Well, it is not the case with the whole, though it is the case with some.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",262
"263","766. It is not the case with the whole?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",263
"264","—No.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",264
"265","767. And in the case of those whose stock is not pledged to the merchants, have these people any little amount of ready money at their hand to deal with ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",265
"266","—Well, that is a question I cannot answer. It is the banker who knows that. I know some who would stock the most of their crofts if they got larger holdings, and that would give more room to the rest, and maybe would improve their condition.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",266
"267","768. So you think some of the crofters,—those who are tolerably well off,—might get other farms, and leave their places to be added to the crofts of those who remain, and so increase the holdings all round ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",267
"268","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",268
"269","769. As a proof of the poverty of the people here, you state that they use the cas-chrom ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",269
"270","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",270
"271","770. But, as I understand, the arable land which each crofter has, measured by the quantity of oats and potatoes that are sown, amounts to 3 or 4 acres?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",271
"272","—I believe between 3½ and 4—some larger and some less.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",272
"273","771. But is that not rather a large amount of land to work in the old-fashioned way with the crooked spade ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",273
"274","—It is too large, and in some cases we must take a horse's work out of a woman; we get them to harrow,— and while slavery is done away with in other countries, it is likely to continue here.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",274
"275","772. But what I want to ask you is why you use the crooked spade and the woman's labour. Why don't you work your crofts in the usual way with horses and plough ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",275
"276","—We have no horses.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",276
"277","773. And that is why you so use the crooked spade ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",277
"278","—Yes, and in some cases we have to wait. We are prevented by climate and weather from getting our seed in. We have to get a day and two days of a plough from other estates, and we pay at the rate of £1 a day for a pair of horses, and you might call it additional rent, though we do not pay it to the landlord.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",278
"279","774. But could not two neighbouring crofters join together as they do in other parts of the country, and then each would have what they call the ""side of a horse,"" and work the land in that way?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",279
"280","—But we have no keeping for the horses.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",280
"281","775. In fact, you are too poor to have horses?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",281
"282","—All too poor to have horses. If I cannot winter two cows and two stirks, how would I keep a horse?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",282
"283","776. Professor Mackinnon.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",283
"284","—What about your own croft before it was halved ? Was it big enough ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",284
"285","—It was not enough at all. It was never subdivided.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",285
"286","777. I thought you said you had only half a croft?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",286
"287","—I had two crofts, and one of them was taken from me.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",287
"288","778. Were those two crofts not big enough ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",288
"289","—No, they were not big enough.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",289
"290","779. Had you a horse at the time?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",290
"291","—No, for there was not a horse allowed on the estate. There was no grazing for horses.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",291
"292","780. Suppose you got an opportunity of stocking a good enough croft, would you be able to do so ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",292
"293","—No, I could not. Perhaps, through time I might try it.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",293
"294","781. I think you said also there was not sufficient room on this estate for the tenants upon it to make them comfortable?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",294
"295","—No, I know there is not.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",295
"296","782. What do you propose to do with the rest ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",296
"297","—Give them crofts in neighbouring places. There is plenty of land there.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",297
"298","783. But suppose the neighbouring places require all they have for themselves ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",298
"299","—No, they do not.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",299
"300","784. At what places would you say there is land where there are no people?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",300
"301","—There is plenty of land at Skerrinish and Scorrybreck, and Kingsburgh.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",301
"302","785 Sheriff Nicolson.—But does not that belong to Lord Macdonald?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",302
"303","—I know that. On every side there is plenty of land fit for cultivation, for most of it was cultivated before.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",303
"304","786. Professor Mackinnon.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",304
"305","—And the fixity of tenure you mean is just a long lease?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",305
"306","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",306
"307","787. And if removed at the end of the lease, then compensation for improvements ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",307
"308","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",308
"309","788. Do you consider the rents at present too high ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",309
"310","—I do, in some cases.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",310
"311","789. But I believe some of them are not so in Bernisdale ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",311
"312","—I know some are too dear in Bernisdale.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",312
"313","790. That is the place you know best?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",313
"314","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",314
"315","791. Sheriff Nicolson.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",315
"316","—What do you consider a proper rent for your own present half croft ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",316
"317","—My present croft is £4, 10s., and I know it would be dear enough at £3.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",317
"318","792. Does it support your two cows ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",318
"319","—It is not wintering for them, and I buy between £2, 10s. and £ 3 worth of provender yearly for them.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",319
"320","793. Have you asked for a lease ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",320
"321","—No.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",321
"322","794. Why not ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",322
"323","—Because I do not see a place worth asking a lease of.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",323
"324","795. And your land was not improved?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",324
"325","—I could not improve it; I was working.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",325
"326","796. Is the work you are accustomed to engage in, upon the roads, more profitable—better for your family ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",326
"327","—Yes, for my family would starve if I should stay to improve the croft.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",327
"328","797. Then, if you got more land, would you give up working at the roads ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",328
"329","—I do not know. If I found the land sufficient to support my family I would give up any work except the land itself.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",329
"330","798. The Chairman.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",330
"331","—You spoke of two occasions on which people were brought in from other places and located at Bernisdale—twenty-four families from various parts of the country, and about twenty families from Skeabost ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",331
"332","—Yes; but 1 did not say that they all came to Bernisdale when Skeabost was evicted the last time.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",332
"333","799. But you think the first time there were twenty-four families; and about how many do you think came to Bernisdale from Skeabost ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",333
"334","—I cannot exactly say.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",334
"335","800. Do you think there were ten ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",335
"336","—I think there were more.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",336
"337","801. Suppose there were ten, that would be thirty-four families here, brought into Bernisdale from other places?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",337
"338","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",338
"339","802. Were the whole of these thirty-four families located upon the common pasture ground formerly belonging to Bernisdale ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",339
"340","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",340
"341","803. All located upon the common pasture ground ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",341
"342","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",342
"343","804. Then, when these new families were placed upon the common pasture ground of Bernisdale, what pasture ground remained to the people of Bernisdale ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",343
"344","—Just a small portion of what they had formerly.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",344
"345","805. How were the new families provided with houses ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",345
"346","—They built huts for themselves. They were not houses.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",346
"347","806. You say each built his own house?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",347
"348","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",348
"349","807. Did they receive any assistance from the proprietor in the form of timber or windows or doors, or anything of that sort ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",349
"350","—Well, I do not think they did; I do not know of any case where they did.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",350
"351","808. On these particular occasions you are not aware that the proprietor gave them any assistance towards the building of the houses ? ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",351
"352","— No.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",352
"353","809. Or any assistance given them towards making the fences round the arable ground?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",353
"354","—No. They make their fences themselves. These were turf dykes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",354
"355","810. When they were removed from their former dwellings, especially when they were removed from Skeabost, did they get any compensation for the houses -which they left and which were pulled down ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",355
"356","—The roofs of the houses were valued, and they were paid the prices.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",356
"357","811. How much is the roof of an old house valued at?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",357
"358","—It depends upon what kind of roof is on the house. Some are valued at £ 3 and some at £2, and some are not worth 30s.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",358
"359","812. Do you think that any of the Skeabost people bought the timber of the old houses to make the roofs of their new houses here with ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",359
"360","—That is according to how the proprietor and themselves would agree about the roof of the house.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",360
"361","813. Then the proprietor would give them 30s., £2, or £3 of compensation for the roof of a house ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",361
"362","—Yes, according to valuation.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",362
"363","814. And the crofters would buy wood with that money for the roof of their new houses?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",363
"364","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",364
"365","815. No other form of compensation?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",365
"366","—Not that I am aware of.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",366
"367","816. When these people came and were settled upon the pasture land of Bernisdale, did the crofters, of Bernisdale, who formerly enjoyed the common pasture, have their rent reduced in consequence of the pasture being taken away, or did they continue to pay the same rent for the reduced ground which they had paid for the whole ground ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",367
"368","—I think they continued to pay the same rent, but you will hear witnesses from the place.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",368
"369","817. When the new people were brought in and located upon the common pasture, and while they were preparing their arable ground and making the necessary improvements for their subsistence, were they allowed to sit rent free, or was the rent exacted from the moment of their arrival?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",369
"370","—From the moment they entered.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",370
"371","818. Was the amount which they paid in the beginning on the same scale as the usual rents for land already improved ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",371
"372","—The very same.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",372
"373","819. Were any of the new people located upon the arable ground belonging to the old people of Bernisdale ? Was the arable land of the old crofts subdivided at all ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",373
"374","—No, I do not think it, but the pasture was taken off the Bernisdale people, and what was fit for arable land was cut into crofts and given to the new people.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",374
"375","820. But the old arable land was not subdivided and reduced?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",375
"376","—I do not think it was.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",376
"377","821 . Now, supposing that more land were given to the crofters for arable, and supposing they got the leases which you spoke of, what description of improvements would they be likely to make ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",377
"378","—By getting the land stocked, they would come to improve the land through time, for I see other people who are keeping large families and thriving on these farms.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",378
"379","822. Would they, for instance, buy lime for the improvement of the soil ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",379
"380","—If they would be able to buy it they would, or if the proprietors would buy lime for them, they would pay interest on the capital, and instalments.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",380
"381","823. If additional land were given them would they be likely to make tile drains and stone drains?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",381
"382","—If they could afford to buy tiles, and I believe they would make stone drains.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",382
"383","824. Would they, if the landlord would advance money for such improvements for drains, pay interest upon them?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",383
"384","—They would.(see Appendix A. II)",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",384
"385","825. Is all rent payable in labour—all obligation to labour—now abolished?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",385
"386","—Well, it is abolished here.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",386
"387","826. All obligation to labour is now abolished here?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",387
"388","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",388
"389","827. And the compensation money which was exacted, instead of the labour, is that also abolished ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",389
"390","—It is abolished.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",390
"391","828. Is it suspended or abolished ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",391
"392","—I think it is done away with altogether.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",392
"393","829. You complain that there are no horses to perform the work of the crofts ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",393
"394","—No horses.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",394
"395","830. Does the landlord forbid people to keep horses, or is it merely their poverty which prevents them keeping them ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",395
"396","—They have no grazing for the horses. They cannot keep them.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",396
"397","831. But does the landlord forbid it?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",397
"398","—It was forbidden here, for I knew people in Bernisdale fined for keeping horses.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",398
"399","832. What is the reason there is a greater objection to keeping horses than to keeping cows ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",399
"400","—Because they do not get any work out of the horses except in the spring time for a few days, and they get use of the cows all the year round.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",400
"401","833. That is the objection of the people, but what objection has the landlord to your keeping horses?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",401
"402","—The landlord knows well enough there is no keeping for the horses. One horse will require as much grass as two cows.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",402
"403","834. Suppose that the landlord was not able to increase the area of arable ground for the crofters, would it still be of advantage to the crofters that the area of the common pasture should be increased ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",403
"404","—It would be of advantage.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",404
"405","835. What stock would they put upon it if they had an increase of common pasture ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",405
"406","—Sheep.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",406
"407","836. They could not keep horses merely on the common pasture ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",407
"408","—They could not keep horses, and they could not keep any more cattle, for they would have no wintering for the cattle.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",408
"409","837. But they could keep sheep?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",409
"410","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",410
"411","838. I want to ask you about the fishing. You stated that there was a yair which in former times existed, and by means of which a great quantity of herring was caught. Where was this yair placed, and what was the nature of it?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",411
"412","—It was placed on Lord Macdonald's estate,on the other side of the loch, just opposite this church.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",412
"413","839. What was it like?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",413
"414","—It was a stone dyke, but one end of it was on dry land, and going out with a semi-circle into the sea, and at ebb tide, if the herring went in there, they were caught by the dyke.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",414
"415","840. Was it destroyed by the proprietor of Skeabost or by Lord Macdonald ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",415
"416","—By the authority of Skeabost and Lord Macdonald's factor together.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",416
"417","841. Why did they destroy it?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",417
"418","—For fear the people would be catching salmon.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",418
"419","842. Did they ever catch salmon in the place ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",419
"420","—Yes, very often.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",420
"421","843. Then, did they bring the salmon to the proprietor, or did they keep the salmon to themselves?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",421
"422","—They kept the salmon for themselves, for they had more need for them.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",422
"423","844. If such a yair were re-established here, do you think they would still catch herring in it?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",423
"424","—I do; for the herring would stand the same chance of being there as in former times.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",424
"425","845. And do you think, if they were allowed to rebuild it, that they would bring the salmon honestly to the proprietor or not?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",425
"426","—That I cannot answer, but it is my opinion they would not.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",426
"427","846. I waut to ask you something about the method of cultivation. In former times we are told there used to be a run-rig system—the land was divided every three years, in new portions between the crofters ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",427
"428","—I believe that was the case, but I do not mind of that.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",428
"429","847. There are no remains of that system of cultivation now?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",429
"430","—No.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",430
"431","848. Did you ever hear the people say they regretted that that system was abolished ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",431
"432","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",432
"433","849. You have heard them say they regretted its abolition?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",433
"434","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",434
"435","850. What do you think about it ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",435
"436","—Well, I don't know, for I did not see that method in my time, and therefore I cannot make any distinction.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",436
"437","851. Did you ever see it in any other part of the country? ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",437
"438","—No.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",438
"439","852. Do you think that any of the people would like to see that system brought back again ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",439
"440","—I am not sure.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",440
"441","853. Professor MacKinnon.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",441
"442","—Do you work under another, or are you a contractor ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",442
"443","—I am a contractor.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",443
"444","854. Mr Cameron.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",444
"445","—What wages do you pay ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",445
"446","—From 2s. to 2s. 6d. a day.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",446
"447","855. Sheriff Nicolson.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",447
"448","—Are you aware that yairs are prohibited now by Act of Parliament as a means of catching salmon ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",448
"449","—I was not aware of that. They knocked down some pieces of that dyke, so as to let out the salmon fish, and they would be allowed to rebuild it again when the salmon fishing was over, and then it was knocked down entirely.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",449
"450","856. Have the houses of the tenants about here been very much improved ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",450
"451","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",451
"452","857. Does the landlord lend any assistance in doing that?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",452
"453","—The landlord pays the whole expense of the house, and charges 5 per cent, of interest upon the houses he builds; and in the case of any one who builds a house at his own expense, the proprietor will give him compensation according to valuation, in the event of his leaving or being removed.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",453
"454","858. Does he give any assistance for improving the outside of the houses ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",454
"455","—He gives them lime.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",455
"456","859. For painting the walls?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",456
"457","—Yes.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",457
"458","860. Is that given free of charge?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",458
"459","—I do not know whether they bought it themselves or whether he gave it them; but I know that is the charge he makes for the money expended on the houses.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",459
"460","861. Are there any regulations on the estate with regard to the houses ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",460
"461","—There are no regulations, except that they have to pay the interest for the houses along with the rent.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",461
"462","862. The Chairman.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",462
"463","—I have been reminded, since I spoke to you about the yair that a yair is now prohibited by law for the purpose of catching salmon. Now, I want to know if the yair was put up for the purpose of catching herring, and if salmon got into it, would the crofters or the fishermen allow the salmon to go free, and be contented to take the herrings and other fish ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",463
"464","—During the summer season there were very seldom any herring got in the yair, and the people would allow the wall to be broken down in some places so as to let the salmon out, and then, when the salmon season was over, to rebuild it, and it would catch the herring then.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",464
"465","863. Then do you think it might be so arranged that the yair should be re-established without iujuring the salmon fishing?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",465
"466","—I think it could. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",466
"467","864. But would the people honestly accept that, or would they use it for the purpose, occasionally, of catching and keeping salmon ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",467
"468","—The people would not be against breaking the yair in some places so as to let out the salmon, and so that they could not catch the salmon. I do not know whether they would have the honesty of going to the proprietor with the salmon or not. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",468
"469","865. But it is against the law to take salmon in that way. Would they let the salmon go free into the sea?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",469
"470","—Yes, the salmon would go free in spite of them, where they got a place to escape. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",470
"471","866. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",471
"472","—As matter of fact, were the salmon you caught a very small proportion of the quantity of herrings caught in former times ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",472
"473","—Very small. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",473
"474","867. The Chairman.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",474
"475","—How many years have you been here?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",475
"476","—I have been settled where I live at present for forty-four years in the same croft. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",476
"477","868. Speaking generally, since you can recollect, do you think that your neighbours—the people round here—are poorer, worse dressed, worse fed, and worse in their circumstances now than they used to be, or do you think they are better off, and live better than they did ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",477
"478","—I know that they are far poorer than they were in former times when I came here. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",478
"479","869. What about the food ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",479
"480","—As to the food, I do not know what food they eat; I see very few of them takiug their food, but I know they are poorer in circumstances, for they are sunk in debt. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",480
"481","870. Do you remember the state of the people before the great potato loss in 1846 ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",481
"482","—Well, it is very little I mind of that. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",482
"483","871. But do you believe the condition of the people was much deteriorated by the disease in the potatoes?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",483
"484","—I believe it was. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",484
"485","872. Now, speaking of the cottars, labourers, what was the daily wage of the labourer thirty years ago?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",485
"486","—Working to the proprietors round about here they would get Is. a day; and in some times of the year, during the cutting of the hay and harvest, a man would get 2s. and a woman 6d. or 9d. At this moment a man gets 2s. from Skeabost, and a woman 1s. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",486
"487","873. Now, are the labourers and cottars worse off than when they got 1s. a day, or is it only the crofters that are worse off?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",487
"488","—They are worse off than when they got 1s. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",488
"489","874. What as to the cottars?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",489
"490","—As to the cottars, I cannot say much about them, but the only thing I can say is that the cottars are a burden on the crofters. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",490
"491","875. Have you any other observation you wish to make before you retire ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",491
"492","—I do not know of any observation I have to make. I have made the only suggestions I know of for improving our condition—that is, plenty of land and reasonable rent. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",492
"493","876. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",493
"494","—You talk about reasonable rents. You mentioned just now that you saw the large farmers all make money. Do you think the large farmers all pay reasonable rents ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",494
"495","—The large farmers have a better chance of making money than the small farmers, where they have great tracts of land well stocked. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",495
"496","877. But that is not the question. I am asking about the rent. What do you think a reasonable rent ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",496
"497","—I would think a reasonable rent for a croft capable of keeping five cows and a horse and between forty and fifty sheep should be about £7. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",497
"498","878. And if you put two of them together, what would you think a reasonable rent for the two of them? —Double that rent. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",498
"499","879. And you say the same thing if you put four together. You think four times the amount a easonable rent?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",499
"500","—Yes. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",500
"501","880. But now the large farmer pays a much bigger rent than that. How far would you go on at that rate of rent?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",501
"502","—Well, I do not know how far I would go on, but I would think that reasonable. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",502
"503","881. It is very much lower than the large farmer pays ?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",503
"504","—I know that people coming from better places buy land in the Highlands free for about twenty-five rents, and we are here after paying twenty-five rents for our land and we have to pay the same yet. ",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",504
"505","882. You don't pay the twenty-five rents in one year?",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",505
"506","—Not in one year.",13,"William Mclure","Skye, Skeabost",506
