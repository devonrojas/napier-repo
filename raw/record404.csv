"225","—No, I don't think I could.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",225
"226","23611. So that you could not make more money in a year out of it?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",226
"227","—No, I don't expect that.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",227
"228","23612. And you consider, since there is no possibility of improvement in that way, the rent is rather high?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",228
"229","—Yes, I do think that.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",229
"230","23613. Do you make butter and cheese or anything of that sort?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",230
"231","—No",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",231
"232","23614. And you sell no grain?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",232
"233","—No.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",233
"234","23615. Just the outcome of the stock?-",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",234
"235","—Just. ",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",235
"236","23616. The people of the parish are much about the same way. What do the young people do when they leave school ?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",236
"237","—Go to service chiefly. ",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",237
"238","23617. In the place?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",238
"239","—Some in the place and some out of the place; some in the island and some leave the island. ",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",239
"240","23618. Do you think it would be difficult if a sufficient wage was given, to get among the people of the island labour enough for the big farms?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",240
"241","—I could not say; I think so.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",241
"242","23619. Where do the people come from—the bowmen—do they belong to the place?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",242
"243","—Some belong to the place and some to other islands.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",243
"244","23620. Is there always a sufficient supply of them?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",244
"245","—There is.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",245
"246","23621. What do their families betake themselves to?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",246
"247","—Service.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",247
"248","23622. In the place or out of it wherever they get it best?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",248
"249","—Yes.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",249
"250","23623. So that, in such a populous place you don't see any difficulty, if sufficient wages were given by the big farmer, why they should not get the service they want?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",250
"251","—Yes.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",251
"252","23624. Do you see any difficulty about it?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",252
"253","—I don't complain about the wage so much.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",253
"254","23625. But so far as people are available for service, do you see any reason why there should be forced labour in connection with the farms? If a better wage was given for labour you think there would be enough men and women?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",254
"255","—Yes.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",255
"256","23626. What is your objection to having big farms on the property?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",256
"257","—Because I think if there were not big farms, we of the poorer class would be more comfortable than we are, and I think we would have no paupers to keep up, for every person could support their own.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",257
"258","23627. Is it off the big farms that pauperism comes?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",258
"259","—I think so, because we are not fit to support the poor.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",259
"260","23628. I suppose very few of the substantial crofters of the place become paupers in their old age?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",260
"261","—-Oh, yes.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",261
"262","23629. Very rarely?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",262
"263","—Oh yes, many of them do; those who have not children fit to support them must become paupers.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",263
"264","23630. Those who have occupied a good croft like your own in their lifetime, is it not a thing of rare occurrence to find them falling to be supported by the rates in old age?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",264
"265","—No, it is not a rare occurrence; it often happens. [See Appendix A. LIX]",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",265
"266","23631. And do you think that also might be relieved if there were fewer large farms?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",266
"267","—Yes.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",267
"268","23632. How would that be brought about ?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",268
"269","—If I had more property to support my parents or whatever it is.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",269
"270","23633. Or to lay by something for your old age?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",270
"271","—Yes, so that I would not become a pauper myself; and I think that is the idea of others besides me.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",271
"272","23634. You would be quite ready to take a larger place if you got it ?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",272
"273","—A little more, but not very large.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",273
"274","23635. Do you think it is a bad thing altogether to have a big farm now and again in the place?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",274
"275","—I don't mean to say every one should be equal in size; but one man to have a 1000 acres and another only two, I don't think it is equal.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",275
"276","23636. You would not like to see crofts all of the same 6ize?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",276
"277","—Yes, I would like to see farms about the same size.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",277
"278","23637. But you have about this place too many big farms?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",278
"279","—Yes.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",279
"280","23638. They are too many and too big?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",280
"281","—Yes.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",281
"282","23639. What other advantage in addition to reduction of the rate would you expect by breaking up the big farms into smaller holdings?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",282
"283","—Comfortable living to those who have small ones.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",283
"284","23640. By giving them increased holdings?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",284
"285","—Yes, and by making them more equalised.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",285
"286","23641. So far as you can go back to the past, do you find the holdings are getting larger or smaller in the district ?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",286
"287","—-In the parish I live in there is not much difference; but I know other places where the holdings are",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",287
"288","getting larger.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",288
"289","23642. Do you consider tint a good thing?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",289
"290","—No, I consider it a bad thing; the big farms are getting larger.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",290
"291","23643. But do you consider it a good thing that the crofts should be getting larger?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",291
"292","—Yes.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",292
"293","23644. And that the big farm should get less?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",293
"294","—Yes, but I don't mean to put every one to a level.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",294
"295","23645. Is it within your own recollection that crofts are getting bigger?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",295
"296","—No, I don't think it.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",296
"297","23646. Are they getting fewer?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",297
"298","—In some cases they are in my recollection.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",298
"299","23647. I suppose you don't approve of that?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",299
"300","—No.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",300
"301","23648. Would you rather that the crofts should get more in number and bigger, and that the farms should get fewer and smaller?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",301
"302","—Yes.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",302
"303","23649. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",303
"304","—If you add taxes to your rent you are paying not much short of £1 an acre ?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",304
"305","— Very nigh that, but not altogether.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",305
"306","23650. And you have nothing outside that?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",306
"307","—Nothing.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",307
"308","23651. Are you acquainted with the rental in various parts of the Highlands?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",308
"309","—No, I am not.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",309
"310","23652. You don't know that £1 an acre is considered there a good rent?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",310
"311","—It depends on the soil.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",311
"312","23653. Mr Cameron.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",312
"313","—Do you think they ever get £29 in the Highlands for two beasts?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",313
"314","—Why not? I think so, surely; it depends on the quality.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",314
"315","23651. Two years old?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",315
"316","—Yes, it depends on the quality.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",316
"317","23655. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",317
"318","—Do you get as good a price for beasts as the big farmer?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",318
"319","—I think so.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",319
"320","23656. And so far as you have got stock, it is as good as that of the big farmer?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",320
"321","—Yes, as far as I can make out.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",321
"322","23657. Has the big farmer done anything else improve the breed?",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",322
"323","—Oh, yes.",404,"David Wallace","Orkney, Sanday",323
