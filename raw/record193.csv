"1","DONALD MACDONALD, Crofter, South Boisdale (71)—examined.",193,"Donald Macdonald","South Uist, Lochboisdale",1
"2","11237. The Clurirman.—Have you a statement to make to the Commission?",193,"Donald Macdonald","South Uist, Lochboisdale",2
"3","—Yes. It is as follows:—' Statement of the Tenants of South Boisdale. Before two Frobost's and Kildonan's people were removed we were better off than we are at present, as we were overcrowded by them. We suffered by their coming among us, and they suffered as much by being forced to come, and their holdings given to tacksmen. There are nineteen crofts in South Boisdale, and there are twenty-nine families on the nineteen. Six cottars are on our common ground ; two of them pay some rent to the factor, though we are under their damage. Four paupers have houses along with them, and they are very destructive to our crops, besides what they have of our land. The common ground was our best arable land; we took it in ourselves, and improved it. The rest of our land is very stony, excepting bits of macher we have. So it was from the common ground we would get the best of our crop in potatoes, and corn, and grazing, were it not for them aforesaid destroying it. About thirty years ago Boisdale was lotted longways ; nine of our crofts was cut across, and put in a lot to Boisdale. We got a gusset of land for what we lost, though not half so good; but five or six years afterwards the ground officer came to us with a paper to sign, to clear ourselves of that gusset; and he said, "" Any of you that will refuse to sign will be removed."" We were promised a reduction in rent We signed for fear of being removed, but no reduction as yet. There is no fishing of any kind going on in our township. We all depend on the land, and in a bad year of this kind on Messrs D. Ferguson & Co. ; and were it not for them, the most of us must have starved this year, and his account will show so. If all our debt was paid very few of us would be left a horse and a cow of his own. A few years ago we were forced to make potatoes for the proprietor; for fear of vengeance we submitted. The people of four townships made them on our peat ground. That park is out of crop this year, and the grazing let to two men unknown to the rest; and we consider that unfair, as the whole township stands in need of it. Our rent was not raised, only we lost the good of our common ground; but we consider our rent too high by cash, as this place was rented when kelp was in demand; with a promise to reduce it if comes any failure in the kelp. Kelp is of no use now, and it is very little work of any kind that is to pay anything. If South Boisdale was tenanted as formerly— one tenant on each croft and the common ground clear, as it was twenty-eight years ago—with the liberty our forefathers have had on the hillpasture, and the rent reduced, or the kelp raised to the price it was drawing when the land was rented according to the price of kelp, we would be better off than we are. At last Martinmas there was a general change to be on the crofters ; but Mr Macdonald, the chief factor, gave us the situation we have. He said as the township was so small, and the people so numerous, and land so scarce, that he would let us be as we were, though there is land which our forefathers have had in Uist. But within five months afterwards the ground officer marked out a piece of our common ground to a cottar. When we saw the promise broken in such a short time, we gathered together, and told the cottar to stop work on our land for two days, till we would get the case settled at the factor's; but he did not heed us. That shows the cottars have more liberty than the tenants, but we know why, because they are only troubling the poor tenants. We pay very high for poor rates and school dues. We will get notice very clever now how much is to pay, but no account of how that money is used.'",193,"Donald Macdonald","South Uist, Lochboisdale",3
