"1","WILLIAM HUGH MACKAY, Tailor, formerly Fisherman, Insheigra (61)—examined.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",1
"2","26671. The Chairman.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",2
"3","—Have you got any statement to make?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",3
"4","—I would like to speak of the condition of the poor fishermen in the district. In the first place they have bad boats; and they have no lines nor herring nets, so as to pursue the fishing with success. The harbour is bad and the land is bad. Many a time the people could work perfectly at sea when they could not come ashore, the coast is so rocky. If we had a ready market for the fish, the people could get a little money, which they cannot get at the present time, for their families and themselves. If the railway was extended to the head of Loch Laxford, it would form an admirable centre for the districts of Durness, and this parish of Eddriachillis, and so the people would be able to send their fresh fish to the market. That is about all I have got to say.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",4
"5","26672. If some fish-curer from the east country would send a good decked boat over here, would you be able to supply a crew?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",5
"6","—Yes, as good a crew as is to be had in the north of Scotland.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",6
"7","26673. Have your ever thought of sending one of your own number over to ask one of the fish-curers to begin a business here of that kind?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",7
"8","—There was a curer who came here different times, but because there was no suitable landing place and no suitable boats that could pursue the fishing with success, the scheme did not succeed.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",8
"9","26674. But do the crew themselves not hire the boats?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",9
"10","—Some do. I tried myself the fishing in that way, but when I got into the curer's debt, then the price of the fish was reduced, and having to get supplies all the same, that put an end to that state of matters.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",10
"11","26675. If a curer brought round a large decked boat to this country, would it not be able to lie quite safely in this place?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",11
"12","—Yes it would, within the loch; but the loch is very far inshore and distant from the fishing grounds.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",12
"13","26676. Where would you propose to make a shelter for such a boat on the coast here?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",13
"14","—At Old Shore; but it would be very expensive. A very suitable place could be erected at  Kinlochbervie for a moderate amount of money.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",14
"15","26677. Who were your partners in the boat when you were in debt to the curer?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",15
"16","—-Three or four of my neighbours.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",16
"17","26678. What size of boat was it?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",17
"18","—A boat of thirty feet keel.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",18
"19","26679. Was she a decked boat ?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",19
"20","—No.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",20
"21","26680. What was the number of her crew?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",21
"22","—Five.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",22
"23","26681. Was she fit to go outside to the banks?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",23
"24","—At times she was ; but of course a decked boat could go oftener to the banks than she was",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",24
"25","able to go.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",25
"26","26682. You said that when you were in debt to the curer the prices fell. Do you mean that the curer made his prices lower than the market price?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",26
"27","—He used to give less for fish to those who were in his debt than to those who were not.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",27
"28","26683. Was he an east coast curer?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",28
"29","—Yes, from Wick and Stornoway.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",29
"30","26684. Is it not common for the men on the east coast and the Orkney and Shetland Islands to start as fishermen in debt to the curer?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",30
"31","—Yes, but herein is the difference; the people upon the east coast get their supplies for perhaps about half the price that we pay for them.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",31
"32","26685. What supplies do you refer to?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",32
"33","—Our lines and nets and every thing we need; it is so difficult to bring things here.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",33
"34","26686. But when the boat would go to Stornoway and Wick fishing? could they not supply themselves?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",34
"35","—Yes. It was there we used to buy them, but we only bought them upon the curer's line",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",35
"36","—by the curer giving us an order—and so advantage was taken of us by means of this line that the curer cave us. ",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",36
"37","26687. Does not the same difficulty meet the east country man who has to get his supplies by means of the curer's line?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",37
"38","—No, because there is a moderate number of wealthy people round about him, who would give him ",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",38
"39","assistance to buy his boat and material may be with ready cash. ",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",39
"40","26688. But is it not the case that the east coast people succeed who do not pay with ready cash, but start in debt to the curer?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",40
"41","—Yes; but we have not the boats. They were not fishing with the same kind of boats when I went to the east coast fishing that they have now; they are much larger now. Again, they go further out fishing, and they require a bigger class of boat.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",41
"42","26689. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",42
"43","—Are you the only tailor named Mackay in this district?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",43
"44","—There is one in Scourie, but none in this place.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",44
"45","26690. You live in Kinlochbervie?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",45
"46","—Between here and the end of the loch.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",46
"47","26691. Have you been here all your days'?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",47
"48","—No, not altogether.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",48
"49","26692. Where have you been?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",49
"50","—Caithness.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",50
"51","26693. Carrying on your business?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",51
"52","—At times.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",52
"53","26694. Did you know that a great number of people from Kinlochbervie district were sent away by a former Duke of Sutherland after the potato famine?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",53
"54","—I could not say if they were sent away, but I knew they went away.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",54
"55","26695. Were their passages paid for them?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",55
"56","—I believe they were.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",56
"57","26696. What became of the lands from which they went; who got them?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",57
"58","—I could not say exactly; I do not wish to interfere with the like of that.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",58
"59","26697. Do you wish to speak upon the fishing alone?",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",59
"60","—Nothing else but the fishing.",450,"William Hugh Mackay","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",60
