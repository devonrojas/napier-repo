"1","DONALD M'QUEEN, Crofter, Conista, Kilmuir (49)—examined. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",1
"2","1986. The Chairman",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected to be a delegate ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",3
"4","— Yes.",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",4
"5","1987. You have a statement to read to the Commission?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",5
"6","—Yes. Kilmaluag, Isle of Skye, 9th May 1883. To H.M. Commissioners, Uig, Skye. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",6
"7","GENTLEMEN, —A Royal Commission having been appointed to inquire into the position of the crofters, we, the undersigned, humbly beg to state our case to you for the consideration thereof. We beg to submit to you that our holdings are too small —some of us having only the name of a croft, and quite inadequate to support human life. Our holdings also are too dear. We, as a whole, would wish more land at reasonable rent. The smallness of the crofts renders it imperative on us to till the whole of our round from year to year, and by so doing the land is growing inferior and less productive. Should we have more land we could work it by rotation, and, by so doing, have the benefits of improved cultivation. We would also desire the hill pasture taken from us to be restored. We also would wish compensation for improvements on our land, and fixity of tenure; by having such, we would have some encouragement to improve, take in, and drain our land, and also to make our houses and surroundings more satisfactory than they are. We would also desire a right to cut sea-ware as a help to the manuring of our crofts,—not as a favour, as we now have it. We consider the land laws unsatisfactory, both to landlord and tenant, and hope that you will commiserate our case by calling the attention of Parliament to it. Should we get our grievances redressed, we are certain that there would be less ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",7
"8","of real pauperism and poverty amongst us; but in the present position of matters we are unable to support ourselves, but are drifting year after year deeper into debt, and all sorts of difficulties. We, the undersigned beg, in conclusion, to hope that you as H.M. Commissioners will give our case your careful consideration, and your efforts on our behalf will be gratefully acknowledged by your humble servants,",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",8

"12","1989. The Chairman.",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",12

"19","1992. How often, and to what extent, have your rents been increased1? ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",19
"20","—Our rents are now double what they were in Lord Macdonald's time. They were raised four times. I cannot tell the first rise that took place in my rent, but in Lord Macdonald's time my rent was £6, 5s., and now I pay £13, including rates. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",20

"22","—Our rents were reduced two years ago. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",22

"26","—About £11, including rates. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",26
"27","1996. Is it a permanent reduction ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",27
"28","—That was not promised. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",28

"48","2006. How soon after that was the rent raised upon you ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",48
"49","—Immediately on our being deprived of that part of hill pasture the rents were raised. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",49
"50","2007. Did the crofters make no remonstrance or complaint ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",50
"51","—We did not complain to the landlord, but we complained to the factor. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",51
"52","2008. What did the factor say ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",52
"53","—The factor told us that if we were not willing to give that rent for it to leave it, and that he had one who would be very glad to take it. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",53
"54","2009. What remedy would you suggest now for the state of things which exists ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",54

"64","2014. Is that not enough to support your family?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",64
"65","—It was enough at one time, but not now. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",65
"66","2015. Why not?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",66
"67","—Bad seasons, and our crop is not what it used to be. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",67
"68","2016. Do you get any work?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",68
"69","—Not in this country. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",69

"73","—Some of us are seeing ourselves as needful of help as any. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",73
"74","2019. Do you think that your croft is not rather above the average of crofts in Skye in regard to size ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",74
"75","—In some places. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",75
"76","2020. Have you sea-ware in the township you are on ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",76

"78","2021. Are you on the shore ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",78
"79","—No. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",79
"80","2022. When a township has the sea-shore does the right of sea-ware go with it ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",80
"81","—Yes. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",81
"82","2023. You ask for compensation for improvements and fixity of tenure, in what form would you wish that compensation for improvements?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",82
"83","—Payment for our work; if we would get paid for our work upon our crofts. We have no great encouragement for improving our crofts in the position in which we are. We don't know how long or how short we may be left in them. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",83
"84","2024. And if you were assured you would not be turned out, you would not expect compensation ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",84
"85","—If we were sure we would not be removed, and got the kind at a fair rent, we would consider that efficient. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",85
"86","2025. You want more land than you have got ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",86
"87","—My neighbours want more land, though I might do with what I have. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",87
"88","2026. That land would have to be got from the tacksmen's land, would it not ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",88
"89","—If got at all it would need to be taken out of the tacks. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",89
"90","2027. Would you need to pay the same rent that the tacksmen pay for that land?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",90
"91","—I don't think any one is so able as the tacksmen ; they take the rent out of the ground. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",91
"92","2028. Then you think the rent the proprietor now gets would not be a reasonable rent for you to pay ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",92
"93","—If we could not take the rent out of it, it would be to the loss of the landlord. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",93
"94","2029. Sheriff Nicolson.",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",94
"95","— Why was the pasture taken from you ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",95

"99","2031. Did Duntulm complain that he had too little land, do you know ? ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",99
"100","—He was taking the smallest lots he could get. He has a croft still in Solitote—among the smallest crofts in the place.",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",100
"101","2032. Does he keep stock upon that separate from the rest of the farm ? ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",101
"102","—There is no stock upon it. It is too small to have stock. It was the skipper of his boat who used to live upon it. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",102
"103","2033. The Chairman.",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",103
"104","—When you say that the crofters require more land, do you mean by that more arable laud and more hill pasture ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",104
"105","— Doubtless.",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",105
"106","2034. But if they cannot get both, would it be more important to them to get the hill pasture than to get the arable land ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",106
"107","—I cannot say. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",107
"108","2035. Sheriff Nicolson.",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",108

"113","2037. Is there any long line fishing?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",113

"115","2038. Do they make a good thing of the lobster fishing ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",115
"116","—Yes. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",116
"117","2039. Who takes them from them?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",117

"119","2040. What part of the year do they prosecute the lobster fishing ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",119
"120","—In the end of October up to the middle of spring. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",120
"121","2041. What price do they get for theni?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",121
"122","—I am not sure, but some of the men are here to-day who can tell. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",122
"123","2042. I suppose there is no herring fishing there ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",123
"124","—No. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",124
"125","2043. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",125
"126","—Where are the cod fish cured ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",126
"127","—In our own houses. I never saw buyers coming our way.",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",127
"128","2044. You sell them cured ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",128
"129","—We don't sell them. We use them for our own families. We were fishing but very little. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",129
"130","2045. Did your boats get destroyed in the storm the year before last ? ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",130
"131","—Yes. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",131
"132","2046. Did you get new ones for them ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",132
"133","—Yes, those who had boats got help. ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",133
"134","2047. The Chairman.",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",134
"135","—Have you any further remarks to make before you retire ?",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",135
"136","—No, there are two other delegates.",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",136
"137","2048. Professor Mackinnon.",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",137
"138","—Are they older than you ? ",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",138
"139","—Yes.",32,"Donald Mcqueen","Skye, Uig",139
