"1","RONALD M'FIE, Crofter and Fisherman, Lusta (46)—examined. ",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",1
"2","3234. The Chairman.",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",2
"3","—Do you come as a delegate from Loch Bay, or or have you come to state a special grievance?",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",3
"4","—Both. ",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",4
"5","3235. Will you state your special grievance ?",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",5
"6","—That I am, for the past twenty-two years paying rent on this estate, and that I have not seen the mill yet, and I do not know where it is, and that I have to buy all the seed that my ground requires every year. And I think there is no remedy for that, but to give the land at its value. £7 is my rent, including rates. £6, 2s. 6d. is my rent. I can keep two cows, but I have to buy from £2 to £ 3 worth of food for them, and I myself spent between £25 or £30 for food for my family.. I think the only remedy is to give us land at a fair rent, sufficient to keep us comfortable. I cannot get return from my land of more value than £5. I have a stirk, and if I feed it well I may get £ 3 for it, and if it is not well fed I cannot get the half of that. I have about fourteen sheep, off which I make from 30s. to £ 2 per annum, and the most of the crofters in my township are in the same condition. The fishing has been bad for the past few years, so that there is no way for people to live unless they get help or land cheap, and if the following year would be as bad as the present the strongest would be uppermost— the weak ones would go to the wall. I have nothing further to say. ",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",6
"7","3236. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",7
"8","—You don't look very well? Are you in good health?",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",8
"9","—I have not much reason to complain. ",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",9
"10","3237. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",10
"11","—You spoke about the mill. Do you mean there is no mill on the property ?",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",11
"12","—There is a mill on the property. ",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",12
"13","3238. You mean you do not go to it ?",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",13
"14","—I had nothing to take to the mill. ",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",14
"15","3239. Did you give the grain to the cattle?",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",15
"16","—No, I do not give it to them every year. ",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",16
"17","3240. What became of the grain ?",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",17
"18","—It is not growing",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",18
"19","—the place is so bad. The rain has denuded the soil, and exhausted it so, that it does not yield crop. ",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",19
"20","3241. If that is the case, why do you sow corn ?",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",20
"21","—We get a little return which is of use in feeding the cattle. ",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",21
"22","3242. Would it not be better to sow grass seed instead of corn?",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",22
"23","—The grass itself would not grow. That would not feed our cows in the winter, though it might be of service in summer and autumn. ",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",23
"24","3243. Do you get anything but straw from your corn crop?",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",24
"25","—No. ",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",25
"26","3244. Then why could not you try the grass? Would you not have a large amount of grass?",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",26
"27","—I do not think I could. It is only peat soil. It is but 1 inch or 2 inches in depth of peat over gravel. ",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",27
"28","3245. Mr Cameron.",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",28
"29","—Do you work it with the cas-chrom?",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",29
"30","—Yes, I was trying it first with the plough. ",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",30
"31","3246. Do you ever try the spade?",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",31
"32","—Yes. ",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",32
"33","3247. Surely you get below 2 inches of moss with the spade ?",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",33
"34","—Yes, but it is getting shallower every year. ",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",34
"35","3248. The Chairman.",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",35
"36","—Do you ever use a pick here to break up the ground ?",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",36
"37","—No, it is not so hard as that.",54,"Ronald Mcfie","Skye, Waternish",37
