"1","ALEXANDER MURRAY, Merchant, Stornoway (46)—examined.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",1
"2","17177. Mr Cameron.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",2
"3","—Whom do you represent?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",3
"4","—Parties who have Murray. grazing lands outside the boundary of Stornoway.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",4
"5","17178. Have you any statement on the subject?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",5
"6","—Yes.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",6
"7","17179. Will you kindly make it?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",7
"8","—Under the Seaforth family the town had from 80 to 100 head of cattle and about two square miles of moorland to graze them on. This moorland extended almost in a straight line from the Stornoway mill to the Creed river, north and south of the Lochs road. That portion of the moorland to the south was used for",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",8
"9","wintering, and that to the north for summering. The rent was 10s. per head of cattle, always paid in advance. The townspeople had arable ground in Goat-hill rented to them in rigs or acres at from £ 2 , 6s. to £6 sterling per Scotch acre. Dykes were made by the tenants. Some of the townspeople had three head of cattle, and a goodly number had two. These having lands used to have potatoes all the year round, grown on their own lands, besides some oat and barley meal. The people were comfortable and well to do. There was no poor rate, or its demoralising tendencies; good schools and good scholars, without an expensive and cumbersome School Board system; no police and no police rate; only one lawyer in the Lewis, and he not overburdened with work. Until recently, we always had a Gaelicspeaking sheriff. The Lewis under the Seaforths was happy and contented, —well fed, well clothed, and imported little if any meal or food of any kind. The old potatoes saw the new in; the surplus of grain they were able to sell was sufficient to keep a large distillery going in Stornoway and no small number of illicit stills, and every man made his own home-brewed nutbrown ale. The legal and illicit stills are gone long syne, and poverty has made the crofters forego their nut-brown ale. Tradesmen and crofters put aside each year their winter stock of beef and mutton. The crofters were able to sell in town their own butter. Neither butter nor cheese was imported, the island producing sufficient for its wants. They did not know what it was to want. In those days the few poor were as well fed and clothed as their neighbours, who from their own fulness supplied those who were indigent. There was no word in those days of the lazy Lewisman. They got sufficient land to keep them employed, and sufficient returns from it to keep them out of debt. No wonder that the past generation spoke of the Seaforth family with affectionate reverence. The late Sir James Matheson bought the island of Lewis in June 1844, and in November of the same year deprived the townspeople of all their summer grazings, and began to enclose the same and to plant it with young wood. This portion is now called Lewis Castle policies. The town being now confined to their summer grazings, the inhabitants saw it was hopeless to keep on their stock, and gradually began to sell them off. A few years thereafter the Goat-hill lands were gradually taken from them, park by park, until about 1854 they had no arable land on Goat-hill. No compensation was given for dykes or improvements. All that the townspeople have now are two parks in Goat-hill for grazing. One park of about 5 acres paid a rent of £20, which this year was reduced to £15,—the other park, of 6½ acres, paying £22, 10s, The number of cattle on these parks is fifteen. The Goat-hill lands were attached to the Manor farm and to the Goat-hill farm. About 1869 the estate took Goat-hill farm into their own hands and turned it into a dairy farm, and shortly after raised the price of milk. The price of milk all the year round prior to 1869 was fourpence per half gallon. In 1869 the price was raised by the estate management to sixpence per half gallon from November to May, and back to fourpence from June to October. The milk supply comes now from the farms of Goat-hill, Melbost, Holm, and Stoneyfield. Goat-hill since 1869 is in the hands of a tenant. As regards evictions, the last of them occurred about five years ago in widow Park. I shall also ask leave to call attention to some remarks made on the crofting system, which has never been properly handled by any one.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",9
"10","17180. We do dot wish your own views of the crofting system, because we have not time to go into it. If any witness has stated facts which you wish to dispute you may do so?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",10
"11","—The total area of the Lewis is 417,460 acres.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",11
"12","17181. We have evidence from the Ordnance Survey map, and we cannot go into that. If you will answer any question on the subject of want of milk, or the taking of pasture lands from Stornoway, we shall be satisfied. Who exactly are the people of Stornoway whom you represent ?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",12
"13","—The inhabitants of the town.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",13

"16","17183. Were they crofters ?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",16

"18","17184. Sheriff Nicolson.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",18
"19","—How did they make their living? Did they ever make their living by the land ?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",19
"20","—They were tradesmen, and the lands were a help to them; and they feel the want of them now.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",20
"21","17185. Then they were deprived of those lands by Sir James Matheson ?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",21
"22","—Yes.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",22
"23","17186. And he took the ground into his hands for the purpose of making a park ?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",23
"24","—For the purpose of making parks, and he lotted it into farms. Part was given to the Home farm, and part to the Goat-hill farm; the remaining three parts were given to the townspeople.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",24
"25","17187. Is Goat-hill let to a tacksman ?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",25
"26","—Part of the hill is attached to the Goat-hill farm, and part is attached to the manor farm. Three parks are held by parties in the town for grazing purposes—at least two for grazing purposes, and one is arable.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",26
"27","17188. Are they parties who had not any of these lands before?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",27
"28","—They had not any of these lands before.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",28
"29","17189. Has the rent of the portion given to these three persons been increased ?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",29
"30","—Yes.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",30
"31","17190. Do they keep cows upon these parks ?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",31

"33","17191. And supply the town with milk ?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",33
"34","—Some families don't use all  the milk; they sell the surplus.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",34
"35","17192. They are not dairy farmers?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",35
"36","—No.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",36
"37","17193. Are there still a few people in the town who have grass for a cow ?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",37
"38","—There are fifteen cows belonging to the town in those parks.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",38
"39","17194. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",39
"40","—I understand your grievance to be this, that the moment Sir James Matheson bought the property, some crofters and other people who were paying small rents outside the burgh boundaries for grass for their cows were dispossessed, and have thereby suffered very great inconvenience ?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",40
"41","—That is so.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",41
"42","17195. And not only so, but detriment to the younger members of their families in the want of milk ?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",42
"43","—Yes.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",43

"45","—No reason alleged.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",45
"46","17197. Of course, the taking away of the ground and adding it to the policies may be some reason, but there was no reason for giving it to tacksmen ?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",46
"47","—There was no reason for taking it for the use of the policies, or giving it to the farmers. The ground was well tilled.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",47
"48","17198. Were remonstrances made at the time or at any other time?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",48
"49","—I do not think there was much use in doing so.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",49
"50","17199. But under the present chamberlain, when any of those leases fall out, would it not be wise for the people to apply to him, and offer at least some rent?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",50
"51","—It would be very wise, if there was any chance of getting it.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",51

"53","—I think so.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",53
"54","17201. What is the value of this land, in respect of being in the neighbourhood of the town, for dairy purposes?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",54
"55","—It used to be rented to the township at from 37s. to 48s. per imperial acre.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",55
"56","17202. What would be the value of it now, considering its situation in regard to the town, for dairy purposes ?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",56
"57","—As to the parks that are already let, one is let at £ 2 per acre, the other at about £3, 15s. ",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",57

"61","—Some families have two cows.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",61
"62","17205. Supposing the chamberlain were willing to let the people of Stornoway or the crofters have moorland, where could that land be obtained ?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",62
"63","—It could be obtained on the ground which is in the hands of the estate.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",63

"68","17208. Don't they keep cows?",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",68
"69","—Not that I am aware of. The Goathill farm is in the hands of another tenant. That farm still sends milk into the town.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",69
"70","17209. Sheriff Nicolson.",309,"Alexander Murray","Lewis, Stornoway",70
