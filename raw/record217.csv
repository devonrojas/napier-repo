"1","JOHN MORRISON, Crofter, Loch Eport (60)—examined.",217,"John Morrison","North Uist, Loch Eport",1
"2","12437. The Chairman.—You have a statement to lay before the Commission ?",217,"John Morrison","North Uist, Loch Eport",2
"3","—Yes. ",217,"John Morrison","North Uist, Loch Eport",3
"4","We, the crofters of Loch Eport, beg respectfully to take advantage of this opportunity which is now afforded us of laying the substance of our grievances before the Royal Commission, which may be briefly stated as follows :—Among the many clearances which took place in the West Highlands, the "" Sollas evictions "" rank so prominently, both for cruelty and injustice, and are so well known to the public, that we need hardly now refer to them; but perhaps as the remnant of the sufferers of those cruelties are now living in the country, it may not be out of place to mention some of the hardships and privations to which we were exposed in consequence. About thirty-two years ago we were evicted from the district of Sollas, a fertile part of this parish. There we lived in ease and plenty, in a happy and prosperous condition, until we became the objects of the covetous eyes of the land-grabbing and aggrandising powers that be, and we soon realised that might was right. The first indication of this was the depriving us of a large portion of our grazing and arable land,",217,"John Morrison","North Uist, Loch Eport",4
"5","which was added to another farm, as well as other hardships, which reduced us in our circumstances, until at last we were finally evicted about thirty-two years ago, as we have mentioned. Those evictions rank among the most notorious which have taken place in the Highlands, being now handed by posterity under the  appellation of "" Blar Shollash,"" or the ""Battle of Sollas."" To this engagement was attributed the death of at least one individual, the permanent disablement of others, the imprisonment of some, and the great loss to  many of their personal property. It resulted of course in a victory for the nobles, and the defeat and utter discomfiture of the peasantry. As is always the case, this battle was fruitful of immense sufferings, hardships, and loss to the defeated. Many of them were compelled to emigrate to the colonies, but fresh trials awaited them before getting to their destination. A deadly case of fever broke out in the "" Hercules "" (the vessel which conveyed them), to which the most of them succumbed. Some were buried in Ireland, others were committed to a watery grave ; thus the survivors had, together with all their hardships, to mourn the loss and untimely end of some of their nearest and dearest relations. Others who remained got corners in other parts of the country,",217,"John Morrison","North Uist, Loch Eport",5
"6","whilst the remainder, who have now the honour to address you, were pitied by the ""Highland Committee,"" and were supplied with labour to keep them alive, until finally sent to Loch Eport, where they still struggle to exist. The hardships to which we were exposed in the interval between our being evicted and our translation here are beyond description. The severities of a winter, living in rude turf huts, and without fuel except what we had to carry twelve miles, told on the health of many. The inferiority of the soil of the place we live in, and its unsuitableness for human existence, is indescribable. When we were sent here, it was, with the exception of two spots, a wild, bleak, barren, mossy heath, numerously intersected by rainfurrows. There we had to build huts in which to live, and try and improve the waste as well as we could; and notwithstanding that we have laboured for the last thirty years, our crofts will not yield us to-day as much food on an average as will support our families for two months of the year. The ground is of such a nature that it can scarcely be improved, and the soil so much reduced by continual cropping that it is almost useless. The place is overcrowded; there being thirty-four crofts, on which live forty families, where formerly there were only three. Our common pasture (if it can be called by that name) is extremely bad, so much so that in winter, those of us who have cattle must keep constant watch else they will stick in the bogs. Human beings cannot travel over portions of our crofts in winter. There is no fishing or industry of any other kind in the country, from which we can derive any support. Formerly we derived some benefit from the manufacturing of kelp, but now we are deprived of even that. All who are able leave in the beginning of summer to earn their livelihood as best they may by sea and land, and thus help to improve the condition of their families whom they leave behind. Finally, we must admit that we are in poverty, and suffering privations and inconveniences of a nature to which the bulk of our countrymen are strangers. We most earnestly pray that the Commission will recommend our removal from this place to some other, where we can live by the productions of our labours in the soil.'
