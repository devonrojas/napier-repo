"4","—Yes.",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",4
"5","25105. Will you make your statement?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",5
"6","—I was born and brought up in the Linehouse in the parish of Walls, and I was there only two years",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",6
"7","when my house was set to another person and I was turned out after I had put about £200 of improvements on a piece of common on the ground. I asked the laird for compensation, but got no answer.",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",7
"8","25106. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh:",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",8
"9","—Who was the laird?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",9
"10","—Mr Heddle. I had to leave there and there was nothing done, and I came away to Rendall and got a small place there, and I am staying there now.",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",10
"11","25107. Is that the grievance you had?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",11
"12","—Yes.",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",12
"13","25108. Had you any lease or any promise that you would get value for your buddings?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",13
"14","—None. Of course I had a promise from the factor but he was not long there; he was turned out too. I put up a new house and the laird was to spend the one-half and I the other. Of course he charged me interest for his one-half, and I paid the other. He charged five per cent, and he turned me out after I put £30 on the house.",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",14
"15","25109. How many years were you paying rent?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",15
"16","—I am not rightly sure. First when I commenced to work on the croft I made my living by fishing, and when I was not fishing I worked on land, and as soon as I got a cow's keep there was thirty shillings put upon me. I went to the factor about it and he said he would put no more rent on in his time; but his time, poor man, was not long. The old house was not worth this, and I went to the laird and he consented to do one-half in erecting a new house. I had to go to work as a cottar for little or no wages or to bind myself down as a slave, or else walk.",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",16
"17","25110. What was the amount of the last rent you paid?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",17

"19","25111. Do you know what the person who got your place is paying?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",19

"21","25112. Has she got the croft you had?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",21
"22","—-She was not long in it; she died a year after.",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",22
"23","25113. What is the present occupant paying?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",23
"24","—It is the orphans who are in it just now. I don't know what they pay. I think about fifteen crofts were made into a big farm, and I think my rent was to be £ 1 , and I was to get a shilling a day for working.",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",24
"25","25114. What was the name of the place upon Mr Heddle's estate?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",25

"34","25118. It is a calculation of the day's labour you put upon it?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",34
"35","—Yes.",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",35
"36","25119. How much do you think you expended in money?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",36
"37","—I was always expending; but what I did was value for that money I think.",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",37

"50","25126. And you paid for the walls?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",50

"60","25131. But you hoped to be allowed to remain?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",60
"61","—I did.",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",61
"62","25132. Did you give any cause of offence by your conduct in any way?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",62

"64","25133. What was the nature of the complaint made against you?",420,"Alexander Wilson","Orkney, Kirkwall",64
