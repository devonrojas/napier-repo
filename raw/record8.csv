"3","—Are you acquainted with the circumstances under which the crofters were removed from Sconser for the purpose of forming a deer forest ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",3
"4","—I was born in Sconser. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",4
"5","420. How long is it since the deer forest was formed ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",5
"6","—There was a deer forest before I was born. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",6
"7","421. How old are you?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",7
"8","—I am fifty-seven. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",8
"9","422. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",9
"10","—What place are you in ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",10
"11","—Tormichaig. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",11
"12","423. The Chairman.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",12
"13","—Did deer forests exist there in ancient times ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",13
"14","— I cannot say, but it was there in my earliest recollection. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",14
"15","424. When you first remember the deer forest were the crofters living in it and near it ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",15
"16","—Yes, I remember the people of three townships being removed for the purpose of their land being added to the deer forest ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",16
"17","425. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",17
"18","—Name the townships?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",18
"19","—Aracharnoch, by the side of Loch Eynort, Moll, Kenchreggan, and Tormichaig. The township in which I was born was the fourth township.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",19
"20","426. The Chairman.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",20
"21","—Can you state approximately about how many families there were in the four townships who were removed?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",21
"22","—I am not sure; there were two families in Aracharnoch, eight families in Moll, and four in Kenchreggan. There were twelve of us in Tormichaig paying rent, and besides these there were cottars. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",22
"23","427. Then there were twenty-six families, besides cottars. When these families were removed, was no payment made to them by the landlord in consideration of the loss to their houses and building, and for their loss by disturbance ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",23
"24","—I have not heard that there was any such allowance. Some of them went to America. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",24
"25","428. Did the landlord assist them on their passage to go to America ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",25
"26","—I do not know. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",26
"27","429. What became of the remainder of the families ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",27
"28","—They were placed in other townships, as the factor saw fit. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",28
"29","430. Was any assistance given to them to build their new houses in the other townships ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",29
"30","—No, I do not believe there was ; we did not get any at any rate. The ground officer valued the houses which we were leaving, and the houses into which we were entering. Our new places were also valued. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",30
"31","431. Who built the new houses?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",31
"32","—I built my own house. It was only a barn that I got when I went to my new lot; I built a new house, and bought the timber for it. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",32
"33","432. Then when the other crofters moved into the new houses, were these existing houses ? or did they build their own new houses ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",33
"34","—That is so. When two families of us would be entering a lot on which there was only one house, one of the families had to build a new house. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",34
"35","433. When you were moved into the new place, were you given new land which you took in, or were you put upon old crofts already cultivated ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",35
"36","—They were old lands which we got.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",36
"37","434. Was there much hardship and sorrow connected with the removal of the people from the deer forests to the place?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",37
"38","—Of course there was. There were no new places ready for us, and the factor was threatening he would cut the couples from above our heads if we would not quit. Mr Ballingall was the factor.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",38
"39","435. When the deer forest was extended and improved, was it then reserved in Lord Macdonald's hands, or was it let to a stranger ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",39
"40","—Lord Macdonald kept the deer forest himself. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",40
"41","436. Was there any common pasture on the deer forest as well as arable ground ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",41
"42","—Yes, we had grazing for our stock as well as arable land. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",42
"43","437. Why were the new houses which they left valued, and why were the new houses valued into which they came ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",43
"44","—The houses we were leaving were valued for the landlord, and as we were leaving them, and were refusing to leave unless we got value for them. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",44
"45","438. When the house which the crofter left was valued more highly than the house into which he moved, was an allowance made to the crofter in the payment of his rent for the excess of value of the old house?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",45
"46","— Yes. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",46
"47","439. And when the new house was more valuable than the old house, then had the crofter to pay the landlord the excess of value ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",47
"48","—Yes, that was the case. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",48
"49","440. Were the new houses generally more valuable than the old or less valuable ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",49
"50","—Yes, of course, the new houses we were entering into were worth more than the old houses which we left. Perhaps the house into which we might enter might happen to be worse than the house we had left. Generally speaking, the house which we got was worse than the house which we left. The barn which I left at Tormichaig was better than the dwelling-house which I got in the new township.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",50
"51","441. Then, had you an allowance made to you in the payment of your rent on account of the new house being worse than the old one ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",51
"52","—Yes, there was an allowance made. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",52
"53","442. How much ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",53
"54","—I cannot remember that very well, as it is thirty-one years since I was removed. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",54
"55","443. Mr Cameron.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",55
"56","—Do you know any case where the house that was left being worse than the house gone into, payment was made to the landlord ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",56
"57","—I cannot tell that, as the tenants have been scattered into every place. I can only speak with regard to the tenants who were located in the township in which I myself was located. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",57
"58","444. In that case was any payment made to the landlord ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",58
"59","—I cannot say. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",59
"60","445. What was done with the land that was taken and added to the deer forest ? Has it ever been cultivated since ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",60
"61","—It was put into grazing. It has not been cultivated since. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",61
"62","446. It was left in grass ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",62
"63","—Yes. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",63
"64","447. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",64
"65","—Was there a mutual valuation of the houses?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",65
"66","—It was a mutual valuation. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",66
"67","448. Sheriff Nicolson.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",67
"68","—Did the people who migrated get their stock valued, in like manner, and paid for?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",68
"69","—They made a roup of their stock. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",69
"70","449. The Chairman.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",70
"71","—Do you desire to make any further statement before you retire ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",71
"72","—I have to say that I have been put to disadvantage since I went to my present place. The rent has been increased on me, and the summing has been lessened. Ten shillings of increase was made on my rent, and the allowance to keep a horse was taken from me. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",72
"73","450. Do you mean the permission to keep a horse ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",73
"74","—Yes. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",74
"75","451. What stock do you now possess?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",75
"76","—Two cows. My summing when I entered my present lot was two cows, a two-year-old, fourteen sheep, and a horse. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",76
"77","452. How much do you now pay?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",77
"78","—I pay £5, 10s. of rent, and with other assessments I pay £6. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",78
"79","453. Mr Cameron.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",79
"80","—No horse ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",80
"81","—No horse. I have sheep. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",81
"82","454. The Chairman.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",82
"83","—How do you support your family ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",83
"84","—I have been for eighteen seasons going to the east coast fishing, and going south, besides, to work for wages. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",84
"85","455. Would you be better off without your croft, or are you better off with your croft ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",85
"86","—I would not be better off without the croft. I would rather have the croft. I would have no home without the croft. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",86
"87","456. Do you wish to state anything more ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",87
"88","—Nothing more. I consider it a particular hardship to have the rent raised upon me, and my summing lessened. We had great liberties when we entered our present township. Our horses could graze up to Sligachan. Our fallow cows and our horses could graze up to Sligachan. ",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",88
"89","457. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",89
"90","—Does your township make any claim to the grazing of Benlee ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",90
"91","—We never said anything about that, but we were claiming the right to it when we entered Camustionavaig. It was Corrie who was factor at that time, and when he saw how high our rents were, he pointed out a little spot on the hill, where we could graze our horses during the summer and harvest.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",91
"92","458. Sheriff Nicolson.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",92
"93","—Was that on Benlee ?",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",93
"94","—I do not say we had a right to Benlee, but that our stock had the liberty of grazing there.",8,"John Mcleod","Skye, Braes",94
