"2","(See Appendix A. XLIV.) ",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",2
"3","25736. The Chairman.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",3
"4","—Are you a delegate?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",4
"5","—I am one of three delegates from the middle district of the parish of Tongue, one of whom you have already heard, and another of whom met with an accident this morning, and is not able to be here. The one who is not able to be here sent me a statement which he had prepared to read before the Commission.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",5
"6","25737. You were elected a delegate along with two other persons, one of whom we have heard and another who is not able to attend?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",6
"7","—He met with an accident this morning, He handed me this paper (produces paper).",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",7
"8","25738. This statement is perhaps rather too long to read. Could you give us the substance of it in your verbal evidence, or is it desirable that we should read it?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",8
"9","—It is not my statement.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",9
"10","25739. Is this a statement on behalf of the people, or a statement referring to a particular personal case?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",10
"11","—It is both.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",11
"12","25740. I think we will take your own statement first. ",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",12
"13","—I was appointed delegate at a meeting held in the Free Church on Wednesday 20th June 1883, by the crofters of Coldbacke and Rhi-Tongue. In the district I represent there are eleven crofters, who  hold from one to five acres of arable land, and pay from 30s. to £7 between rent and taxes. Their common pasture is Cnocand Fhreiceadain (Sentinel Hill). ",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",13
"14","1. Rents.—",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",14
"15","The rents are considered high. Within the recollection of some of themselves their rents were doubled. Since the year 1808 the rises were ",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",15
"16","(1) a lot of 2½  acres was rented at 20s., which was considered a hardship at the time; ",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",16
"17","(2) the lot of 2½ was rented at £ 4; this was done after a southern sheep-farmer of the name of Clarke (and Anderson, factor) had moved Lord Reay to re-value the land;",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",17
"18","(3) 4s. added for road money and 6s. for work that was wont to be done by the crofters; the road-money had to be paid by every young man as well as old, and whether he held a croft or not; this was about thirty years ago. The 10s of additional rent were not taken off, though we pay road money now, and though we know and all acknowledge that to give labour or money in lieu of work to the laird, to whom a reasonable or rather unreasonable rent is at the same time paid, is wrong—most unjust. Still rents are raised as often as a change of tenant takes place. And three years ago there was an attempt made to raise our rents, which failed, for well-known reasons.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",18
"19","2. Houses. —",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",19
"20","Their dwellings contain two rooms and a closet. They were built and are kept in repair by themselves. They were built on certain conditions; these were—that if evicted within seven years two-thirds of their value was to be considered as belonging to the tenant; if within fourteen years one-third, and if after nineteen years nothing—the whole belongs to the proprietor. Some timber and lime were given by the Duke's agent for building them; six couples for a thatched house, which requires about fifteen; twenty couples for a slated house; and some tabling for the walls; but no doors nor windows. Three bolls of lime were given; and for outhouses, all of which were built by the crofter, permission at certain seasons was granted to cut down natural wood.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",20
"21","3. Stock :—",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",21
"22","An average of three head of cattle and six sheep. ",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",22
"23","4. Required:",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",23
"24","—We want re-valuation of our lots, larger holdings, security against evictions, and compensation for",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",24
"25","unexhausted improvements. ",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",25
"26","Coidbackie, in parish of Tongue.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",26
"27","—There are eleven crofters in Coulbackie and Rhi-Tongue district, viz.:—",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",27

"36","M’Kay having 2 ¾ acres and paying £0/0/0",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",36
"37","Sutherland, having 3 acres and paying £4/10/0",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",37

"39","25741. In the district you represent there are eleven crofts?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",39
"40","—There are.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",40
"41","25742. And each crofter holds from one to five acres of arable land?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",41
"42","—Yes",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",42
"43","25743. Their common pasture is called Sentinel Hill; is it a spacious and convenient pasture?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",43
"44","—It is.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",44
"45","25744. At what period was this little district formed? is it an old place? Have there been crofters there from time immemorial; or was the land lotted out at a recent period?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",45
"46","—I cannot answer the question with that exactness I should like, but I know that some of them are descendants of those who were evicted from Ribigill to make room for sheep.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",46
"47","25745. Where is Ribigill?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",47
"48","—To the west of the district, about four or five miles.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",48
"49","25746. Is it still adjacent to those crofters' lands?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",49
"50","—Not quite.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",50
"51","25747. Does it march with their hill pasture?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",51
"52","—I think so; that is my opinion.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",52
"53","25748. How long have you been acquainted with the district?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",53
"54","—Only three and a half years.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",54
"55","25749 Are the crofters at the present moment in a state of great depression and poverty?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",55
"56","—They are.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",56
"57","25750. Is it your impression that the rents as here stated are too high ; are they higher than the fair value of the land?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",57
"58","—It is my impression that they are high.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",58
"59","25751. They seem to have been raised at three or four different periods. Do you know whether any benefit was conferred upon those people in connection with their rents being raised, or any improvement made upon the lands by the proprietor?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",59
"60","—1 am not aware. I know that the proprietor has improved, but I am not sure that it was in connection with the raising of the rents, and I rather think not.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",60
"61","25752. Of what nature are the improvements on this portion of his property?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",61
"62","—He has given encouragement to them to build better houses.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",62
"63","25753. Has he done anything for roads?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",63
"64","—There is a road through to Coulbackie—a county road.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",64
"65","25754. Are there any other outlays the proprietor has made, in the way of draining and fencing for instance?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",65
"66","—I am not aware. Generally speaking the people themselves drain and fence and trench their lots.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",66
"67","25755. Are you cognisant of any case of eviction which has ever taken place in this township?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",67
"68","—No.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",68
"69","25756. When the tenants fall into arrears of rent are they proceeded against summarily, or is time given to them to pay up their arrears?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",69
"70","—There is time given to them—at least in some cases.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",70
"71","25757. Do you know of any case in which a removal has taken place on account of arrears of rent?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",71
"72","—Not within my district.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",72
"73","25758. Are the dwelling houses generally of a very mean character?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",73
"74","—No, they are better than the houses in the surrounding districts.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",74
"75","25759. Are they generally houses built with stone and lime?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",75
"76","—They are.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",76
"77","25760. Are they slated?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",77
"78","—Some of them; perhaps I should say most of them.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",78
"79","25761. Are they houses of two rooms?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",79
"80","—Two rooms and a closet.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",80
"81","25762. Have any houses of that kind been built since you came to the place?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",81
"82","—Yes.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",82
"83","25763. In your statement you say they were built and were kept in repair by the people themselves; but then it appears by the explanation that they are not built entirely at their own expense",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",83
"84","—Quite so; that is the general statement made by the people themselves at a meeting we had, at which I took down their statement. The proprietor did give some assistance.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",84
"85","25764. Have you heard it generally stated since you were here that the people were dissatisfied with the conditions on which the houses were built?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",85
"86","—Yes.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",86
"87","25765. I mean, not recently, since the present movement began; but did you hear so at a previous period?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",87
"88","—They have said so to me.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",88
"89","25766. From an earlier period?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",89
"90","—From an earlier period.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",90
"91","25767. The statement says that after nineteen years have elapsed the whole of the houses would then belong to the proprietor; there would be no compensation paid afterwards upon that?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",91
"92","—None whatever.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",92
"93","25768. Do you think that such a house would have any material value after the lapse of nineteen years, if it were kept in good repair? Would it still be a substantial house?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",93
"94","—I think so; I am sure it would.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",94
"95","25769. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",95
"96","—Have you got anything else to state on behalf of the people generally of your parish?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",96
"97","—I have to say that I know there are loud complaints that there is no encouragement given to the young people to stay at home, and to get lots to work; nor is there much encouragement given to those who do stay at home to seek employment. My meaning is that the young and able-bodied men have to leave the country during the larger half of the year to seek employment far from their homes. Consequently much of what they earn away from home is spent away from home, and they do not therefore benefit their families by their earnings as they might otherwise do if they were enabled to earn their bread at home.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",97
"98","25770. Are you a native of Sutherland?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",98
"99","—-I am not.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",99
"100","25771. Where did you come from?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",100
"101","—Tyree. I may say I come from Skye, but I happen to have been born in Tyree.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",101
"102","25772. Do you concur in what has been stated by some of the previous delegates, that there is a large field for young men in the county of Sutherland if it were opened up to them?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",102
"103","—I do.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",103
"104","25773. Do you think it would be useful and profitable for the county for the young men to get employment at home instead of going abroad?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",104
"105","—I think so.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",105
"106","25774. And there is nothing in your mind to prevent this to a great extent being developed in this county?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",106
"107","—No, not as far as I know.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",107
"108","25775. All that is necessary is the means and inclination?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",108
"109","—Yes.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",109
"110","25776. The hands are here to do it?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",110
"111","—They are when they are at home; but most of the people are away just now, earning daily bread",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",111
"112","in the rest of the country.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",112
"113","25777. But if encouragement were given all the year round would they prefer working at home in the country?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",113
"114","—During the winter season when they are at home a good deal could be done in the way of giving them employment, but I am sorry to say there is little being done.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",114
"115","25778. I am referring more to the opening up of big sheep farms, and forming a number of smaller farms within the reach of the people of moderate means; do you think that would be a wise thing to do?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",115
"116","—I do think so, and I think it is a thing our young men are looking for—it is what they would like.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",116
"117","25779. Although young men from Sutherland do go away, it is from want of attachment to their country that they do so?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",117
"118","—I believe it is not, I believe they are warmly attached to their native country. ",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",118
"119","25780. Is it from hard necessity that they are obliged to do it?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",119
"120","—It is.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",120
"121","25781. Do you suppose now that if a croft were enclosed to such an extent that it would really of itself support a family respectably, there would be any danger of the croft being subdivided?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",121
"122","—No, provided the proprietor gave new land to the young men who asked for it,",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",122
"123","25782. And so long as there was any land in the country do you think the proprietor ought to do so?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",123
"124","—I think so.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",124
"125","25783. Do you find the people in the place quite peaceable and industrious?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",125
"126","—Very quiet, very peaceable, very intelligent, and very orderly.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",126
"127","25784. Are there many inns or public houses in the parish?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",127
"128","—Only one.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",128
"129","25785. Where is it?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",129
"130","—At Tongue village.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",130
"131","25786. Are there any grocer's licences in the parish?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",131
"132","—Not one so far as I am aware.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",132
"133","25787. So far as your observation has led you, do you concur in what has been said, that there is a great want of harbour or quay accommodation in the whole north-west of Sutherland?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",133
"134","—I do; I know that it is very difficult, during the winter season especially, to prosecute any kind of",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",134
"135","fishing.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",135
"136","25788. And both in exporting and importing there is hardship and expense placed upon the people which might be avoided?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",136
"137","—There is; and I think the want of harbour accommodation is one of the great drawbacks of this coast.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",137
"138","25789. Are you aware if the attention of the proprietor has been drawn to the improvement of that?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",138
"139","—Often; I know that his attention has been directed frequently to it.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",139
"140","25790. Why does it come to nothing?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",140
"141","—That is what I cannot tell.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",141
"142","25791. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",142
"143","—Do you know the circumstances of the people of Tyree?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",143
"144","—No.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",144
"145","25792. Of Skye?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",145
"146","—I do, and also of Lewis and of the islands.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",146
"147","25793. You mentioned that the rents here seemed to you to be high; are they high compared with the rents in Skye and Lewis?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",147
"148","—In the district which I represent I think they are higher.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",148
"149","25794. Than in Skye or Lewis?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",149
"150","—It is difficult for one to speak for the whole island.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",150
"151","25795. You think they are high?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",151
"152","—I did not think of comparing them, but I know Skye pretty well, and Lewis, and I know that Coulbackie and Scullourie are more highly rented than some places I could mention on those islands.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",152
"153","25796. Do you think the people here are anxious to find work in the winter months?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",153
"154","—They say so to me, and I see no reason to doubt them.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",154
"155","25797. It is an old custom in the Highlands to lie on their oars from Christmas till seed time?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",155
"156","—Some of them do work when they can get it.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",156
"157","25798. Is the weather similar to what it is in Skye and Lewis?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",157
"158","—Not so wet",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",158
"159","25799. It is more suitable for outdoor work?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",159
"160","—It is.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",160
"161","25800. Has encouragement to build houses been given since ever you have been here?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",161
"162","—Yes.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",162
"163","25801. You have not noticed that the encouragement has been increased within the last few months?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",163
"164","—Yes.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",164
"165","25802. Mr Cameron.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",165
"166","—You have stated that you thought the rents were high, and you compared the rents with the number of acres of arable land at the same time you said that the hill pasture was good. Do you not think that the condition of the hill pasture ought to be taken into account in criticising the rents?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",166
"167","—Yes, I do.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",167
"168","25803. Supposing the crofters had arable land and no hill pasture; in that case almost any rent would be too high, would it not?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",168
"169","—It depends upon the nature of the soil. If there was very good soil, of course they could live on it without any hill pasture.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",169
"170","25804. You mean that hill pasture to a crofter in the Highlands is essential?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",170
"171","—It is.",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",171
"172","25805. And therefore ought fairly to be taken into consideration in judging whether the rent is a fair one or not?",431,"Rev John Ross Macneill","Sutherland, Bettyhill",172
