"2","27899. Mr Cameron.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",2
"3","—Have you any statement to make?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",3
"4","—Yes. ",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",4
"5","Petition of the Crofters residing in Altandu, in the Parish of Lochbroom",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",5
"6","—Unto the Royal (Crofters') Commissioners, humbly sheweth,",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",6
"7","That there are at present eighteen crofters and four cottars residing within the bounds of Altandu paying a rent of about £ 50 : that in our grandfathers' days the township only paid £ 7 , and was tenanted by five crofters, with much more pasture-land than we at present possess, part of which pasture-land is now under sheep and deer. That our arable land at present averages about three acres for each croft: that it has been tilled yearly for a great number of years, except what has been lately improved by ourselves, and that this improved land has been rented : and that some short time ago our rents were raised considerably. That as we are compelled to till our land yearly we can scarcely make half a boll of meal for every pound of rent we pay. That should we build a house at our own expense, if we leave or are put away we receive no compensation whatever : that we generally receive some lime and sticks for a house and then the whole house is claimed for their value. That at present some of us are so deeply in debt that it would take nearly all our stock to pay up the debts of merchants who have advanced meal and other necessaries of life to us. That some of us are compelled to go below tide-mark and gather whelks, &c., to eke out a scanty livelihood. That our chief manure is sea-weed, which we have great difficulty in getting ashore, owing to the want of any suitable landing-place, so much so that often our lives and boats are in danger, and that we have to carry this manure in creels on our backs from the shore to our crofts. That for every horse we keep we must pay £ 1 in addition to our rent: that we merely report we need the horse we must pay from that time although we may not have it for some time after saying we require it. That it is chiefly by means of the caschrom that our patches of arable land are cultivated from anions the rocks and bogs. That what we wish is more arable and pasture land, sufficient to keep ourselves and our families, say from ten to twelve acres in each croft, and for which we are quite willing to pay a reasonable rent; compensation for  improvements to our land ; abolition of the £ 1 charged for keeping each horse; small local harbours erected round the coast so that we may land fish, and the sea-weed required for manure; and that Government would advance boats and fishing material to those who have no land, and to the young men who are experienced fishermen.' ",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",7
"8","Statement from Coigach.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",8
"9","—The average size of our crofts is about three acres. The original size was much more than this but was reduced by subdivision. When Badentarbet and Achnahaird were turned into sheep farms, the hill pasture of Polbain, Altandu, and the township of Achnahaird was considerably diminished. We have to build our own houses, and only of late years do we get a little wood for roofing, but receive no compensation on removal nor for improvements we make on the lands. When any improvement is made on the lands our rents are immediately raised in proportion, and we therefore receive no benefit from them. We have also to pay for the seaware which we gather on the shores of Isle Ristol and Old Dornie. This island, as well as all the summer Isles, was once in the possession of the people, and taken from them about the same time as Badentarbet and Aucbinaird. We also feel that pauperism is greatly on the increase owing to the failure of the fishing, the unproductiveness of the soil, and the high rents—e.g., the rental of the district of Reef is about thirteen times what it was 100 years ago. If any crofter keeps a horse, he must pay £1 to the factor, even when the horse grazes on the crofter's own hill pasture. There is a patch of ground about twelve acres, in the very middle of the island of Tanera belonging to another proprietor. It is the best part of the soil, and should be given to the people. Being without a fence, the present tenant must be constantly driving away the people's sheep and cattle, so that they cannot get the good of the pasture for acres around this park. We should like, therefore, to have larger holdings, security against evictions, and raising the rents on improvements, assistance to build better houses, and to get better boats and nets, and that safe and proper landings be erected on our shores to enable us to prosecute the fishing.'",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",9
"10","27900. I understand this is a particular statement from your parish!",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",10
"11","—Yes.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",11
"12","27901. Who wrote the statement from Coigach ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",12
"13","—Our minister, Mr Finlayson.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",13
"14","27902. Did he compose it as well as write it ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",14
"15","—No.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",15
"16","27903. Who composed it ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",16
"17","—The neighbours.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",17
"18","27904. Did they appoint a committee to draw it up ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",18
"19","—Yes.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",19
"20","27905. And the committee met at the minister's house ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",20
"21","—No, at the church.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",21
"22","27906. How many members were there on it ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",22
"23","—I am not sure, a good many members.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",23
"24","27907. A dozen or twenty?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",24
"25","—Over a dozen I suppose.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",25
"26","27908. Were you one of the members of committee1?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",26
"27","—Yes.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",27
"28","27909. Did the committee suggest these statements to the minister, or did the minister first write the paper and suggest them to the committee ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",28
"29","—The committee first suggested them to the minister, and he wrote out what they suggested.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",29
"30","27910. Were there any strangers present besides the minister?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",30
"31","—I am not aware of any.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",31
"32","27911. It is stated in this paper that when any improvement is made on the lands your rent is immediately raised in proportion, and thus you therefore receive no benefit from the improvement : when was the last increase on the rent made ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",32
"33","—Three years ago.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",33
"34","27912. Do you remember when the previous increase was made ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",34
"35","—No, but there are those here who remember it.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",35
"36","27913. About how many years ago was it?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",36
"37","—About forty years.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",37
"38","27914. So that it has stood for forty years without the rent being raised ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",38
"39","—Not as far as I know, but there is another delegate here older than me.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",39
"40","27915. What is your own rent at the present moment?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",40
"41","—Over £4.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",41
"42","27916. How much over ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",42
"43","—£4, 8s.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",43
"44","27917. Without taxes ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",44
"45","—Without taxes.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",45
"46","27918. What was it three years ago?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",46
"47","—£3, 16s., only I was paying an extra pound, for keeping a horse.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",47
"48","27919. So that you were raised 12s. ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",48
"49","—Yes.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",49
"50","27920. In fact, after holding the croft forty years it was raised 12s. ",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",50
"51","—As far as I know.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",51
"52","27921. Will you explain about this horse—it is stated here that when a crofter wishes to keep a horse he pays a pound whether he keeps the horse or not?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",52
"53","—After I myself had improved the land I could not work the improved land without a horse. I trenched more than half the whole lot; 740 yards of stone drains I made myself. I made 365 yards of open drains in order to drain away the surface water. After I made this improvement, I could not work the place without a horse. I went to the factor and asked permission to keep a horse, and he was quite willing to give me the permission, only I would have to pay an additional pound for it. I had not the means to buy the horse at that time until after two years were due, and I had to pay the pound for the horse upon these two rents—that is, I paid for two years before I got the horse. And although we should provide summer pasture for the horse in a different parish, or even in a different county, still we would have to pay this pound additional for the horse. I myself in one of these years grazed a horse in a different place and I paid the pound.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",53
"54","27922. Did you ever represent this grievance to the factor?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",54
"55","—Yes, I made a complaint to the factor about it. When I paid my first rent after I got permission to keep the horse I told the factor then that I had not actually a horse at all. It was to Mr M'lver, the local factor, that I told this.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",55
"56","27923. What did he say?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",56
"57","—I put down the total rent—that is, the old rent that was paid, and the additional rent that was added on three years ago, on the table, and he shoved it to the other side of the table and said he could not accept it unless I paid the pound for the horse as well.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",57
"58","27924. When you complained to the factor about putting on the pound for the horse, what did he say in answer to your complaint, or did he say anything?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",58
"59","—He said that it was not he who prevented me from keeping a horse, and I replied that I was not able to purchase a horse although I got permission to keep it, and he said that was none of his business.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",59
"60","27925. Is that all he said ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",60
"61","—That is all, in addition to what I have stated already, that he would not accept the rent from me without the additional pound as well",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",61
"62","27926. What is the amount of the stock which you keep on the croft ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",62
"63","—A horse and three, four, or five head of cattle as the case may be,—sometimes the one and sometimes the other.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",63
"64","27927. Is the pound paid for the horse included in the rent you gave me just now ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",64
"65","—There is £ 1 , 8s. for the rent and a pouud for a horse whether I have it or not.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",65
"66","27928. Then what is your stock not including the horse ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",66
"67","—Three, four, or five head of cattle as may be, and a dozen sheep, more or less. I want to make a statement about the cattle. Although I and my neighbours keep a certain number of cattle, and although the factor allows us to keep them, the crofts will not support them.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",67
"68","27929. What do you do with the cattle in winter. Do you buy extra food for them?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",68
"69","—We buy food for them iu winter and spriug, if we can get it.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",69
"70","27930. Used you formerly to keep that number of cattle, or did you keep fewer ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",70
"71","—I never kept a larger stock than that, but my forefathers kept a larger stock when they had more pasture ground —ground which is now occupied by sheep and deer.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",71
"72","27931. Is it want of wintering that prevents you from keeping that number of cattle, or want of grazing ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",72
"73","—Both.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",73
"74","27932. Is there any hill grazing or arable ground adjacent to your croft, and which could be added to your croft with advantage ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",74
"75","—Plenty of it.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",75
"76","27933. Lying on the bounds of your croft—contiguous to it?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",76
"77","—Yes, land under sheep adjacent to our pasture land.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",77
"78","27934. If portions of that were added to your croft would it give you arable ground as well as hill pasture, or only hill pasture ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",78
"79","—-Certainly it would give us more arable ground and hill pasture as well.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",79
"80","27935. Has that land adjacent to your croft ever been under the plough?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",80
"81","—Yes, it has been under the cas-chrom.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",81
"82","27936. Is it of the same quality as that which is described as being so inferior that it can only be worked by the caschrom ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",82
"83","—Part of it is six times more value; because I have it from my father. ",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",83
"84","27937. But judging from your own eyes do you consider that the land would plough ? ",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",84
"85","—Yes, I have heard my father say that out of this land which I have spoken of he would take a creel of potatoes for every creel of seaware used in manuring it, and now I can only dig a creel of potatoes",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",85
"86","for every six creels of sea-ware out of the croft I have.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",86
"87","27938. In this paper it is stated that the crofters wish security against evictions; are we to understand by that, that there have been in recent times arbitrary evictions ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",87
"88","—I cannot say in quite recent times that there have been arbitrary evictions. Another delegate will tell exactly when the evictions took place; there were some.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",88
"89","27939. Within your own experience have there been arbitrary evictions ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",89
"90","—None in my neighbourhood within my recollection.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",90
"91","27940. Will you explain about the patch of ground in the small island of Tanera ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",91
"92","—Mr Bankes of Gruinard and Letterewe got a piece of ground called the Parks, which once belonged to the late Mr Macdonald of Tanera, and is now occupied by people from the other side of Loch Broom —from the Poolewe neighbourhood and district. They had no right to go beyond the dyke fences upon this cultivated portion to the pasture surrounding the place, but they are there for the last sixteen years, and, so far as I can hear from others, for a considerable number of years back. The fences are not well kept up so as to keep cattle in or out. Now these tenants of the late Mr Bankes chased their neighbour's stock with dogs. The cattle stray in and out, and those that are within, chase their neighbour's stock with dogs. People tell me they have complained to. The factors upon this property, and that they have got no benefit from that.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",92
"93","27941. You state here that you wish that the people could get better boats and nets, and that a safe and proper landing place should be put up upon the shores to enable them to prosecute the fishing ; and in the first paper you say you wish the Government to supply these nets ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",93
"94","—I would prefer that you would confine my examination to the first paper.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",94
"95","27942. Do the people fish much ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",95
"96","—Yes.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",96
"97","27943. Are they fond of fishing ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",97
"98","—Yes.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",98
"99","27944. They take naturally to it?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",99
"100","—Some of them; there are some without any land at all, and these go to the fishing.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",100
"101","27945. Are there many cottars ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",101
"102","—Yes.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",102
"103","27946. How many ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",103
"104","—Four in Altandu.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",104
"105","27947. Are they fishermen?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",105
"106","—Some of them.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",106
"107","27948. Are the people too poor to buy nets and boats for themselves?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",107
"108","—Much too poor. Could you expect anything else from those who make their livelihood from the whelks gathered on the sea shore?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",108
"109","27949. I suppose I may take it for granted that what the people about you really want are larger holdings, both arable and pasture, and assistance to enable them to prosecute the fishing ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",109
"110","—Yes, but they have no landing",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",110
"111","place, even supposing they had boats and nets.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",111
"112","27950. They also want piers ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",112
"113","—Yes; boats and nets and a pier for fishing. I have an additional matter to bring up if you give me the",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",113
"114","opportunity.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",114
"115","27951. The Chairman.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",115
"116","—Go on.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",116
"117","—The tenants of Achnahaird march with us on one side. Some of their pasture land is upon our march and some of their arable land is upon our march. These people had about a third part of their arable and pasture land taken from them and added to a neighbouring farm. Now this has thrown their burden upon us who march with them and is an extremely hard matter for us. It confines us very much. The one tenant cannot very well quarrel with the neighbouring tenant on the matter when the factor will not settle matters between us. In my father's time there were three tenants from our township transplanted into a part of our own hill pasture and settled there. They pay £ 10 of rent, and these three get a considerable portion of pasture land which property belongs to Altandu.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",117
"118","27952. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",118
"119","—You said that the person who put the pound on you was not the present factor?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",119
"120","—I didn't say that.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",120
"121","27953. Is that custom about the pound going on to this day?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",121
"122","—Yes.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",122
"123","27954. Had the people in your township horses of old?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",123
"124","—Yes, they had as many as they pleased, and they used to winter and summer in a place called Strath Polly, now under sheep and deer.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",124
"125","27955. Was it at the time that hill pasture was taken from them that the privilege of keeping horses was taken away ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",125
"126","—I believe it was, but I cannot be very well certain; an older delegate might speak better to that.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",126
"127","27956. Can you give any explanation why you are prohibited from keeping horses ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",127
"128","—No.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",128
"129","27957. Have you turned it over in your mind, over and over again to think what the reason could be ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",129
"130","—Yes, I have turned it over often enough in my head, but I could not make it out. Is it not quite manifest to any one when he has a pound to pay whether he has a horse or not, that all the estate managers want is money ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",130
"131","27958. Who is the tenant of Badentarbet just now?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",131
"132","—A Mr Cameron.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",132
"133","27959. Were there any crofters removed from that farm originally ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",133
"134","—Plenty of them.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",134
"135","27960. You stated that the farm of Baden Tarbet which was taken away was, according to the story of your father, six times as good ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",135
"136","—There wer three places —Old Dornie and Risdale and Baden Tarbet which were occupied by tenants long ago, and which were then worth six times the value of the places, I now work, according to my father's story.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",136
"137","27961. Was it your opinion from what you heard from your father, that it was because they were so good that they were taken away and put into a sheep farm ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",137
"138","—I could not say that.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",138
"139","27962. Why did they take that particular part?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",139
"140","—It is very likely that may be the reason, although I cannot say.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",140
"141","27963. And is it likely they left the bad parts because they were not worth taking ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",141
"142","—Yes, they were hardly worth taking.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",142
"143","27964. With regard to your improvements, you have told us you drained so much, both open and closed drains, and improved your croft altogether; what assistance did you get from the proprietor?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",143
"144","—Nothing. I got nothing, but it was the factor's people that measured the place four years ago, and I complained to him then that I had made a great deal of improvement upon the place, but he said nothing, I am in that respect in much the same condition as my neighbours who sent me here.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",144
"145","27965. Is it an encouragement to you and others to make improvements in these circumstances ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",145
"146","—How can it be an encouragement to make an improvement, when not only you get no compensation for making them, but the rent is increased ?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",146
"147","27966. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",147
"148","—Has any sub-division of crofts taken place in your life-time!",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",148
"149","—Not in my time, but there are two families living within the bounds of one croft as they were originally allotted.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",149
"150","27967. How did these other families get there?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",150
"151","—When a father died sometimes he left two sons and they would remain upon the land.",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",151
"152","27968. You mentioned that pauperism is on the increase, to what do you attribute that specially?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",152
"153","—The reason is, the smallness of the lots occupied by the people. The population is increasing and the amount of land occupied by them is getting less, getting worse, and getting dearer. ",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",153
"154","27969. Is it to the dearness of the land or to the smallness of the lots that you attribute this tendency to pauperism?",466,"John Maclean","Ross-shire, Ullapool",154
