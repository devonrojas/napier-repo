"1","ADAM HOON, Factor for Mr Hebden of Eday. residing at Carrick (59) —examined.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",1
"2","23734. The Chairman, ",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",2
"3","—You are not a farmer?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",3
"4","—In a small way for the last two years.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",4
"5","23735. Where is Carrick?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",5
"6","—At the north end of Eday.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",6
"7","23736. Were you present when some of the evidence was given about the island of Eday?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",7
"8","—I was.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",8
"9","23737. And you wish to make some statement?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",9
"10","—Yes, in regard to the peat-cutting by the people. I heard it for the first time that it was a grievance of the tenants to cut peats and dispose of them I have never heard such a statement made by the tenants until this day. We always considered it was a benefit for the tenants, as it brought in a lot of money to the island, and it has been continued for the benefit of the tenants more than that of the proprietor all along. The same remark applies to the kelp. It is not much of that we make, but we consider it is for the benefit of the tenants also, because many young and old people not fit to do much hard work make a little at the kelp-working, and it brings in a little money to enable them to pay their rent. In fact cottars could not pay their rent if it were not for the kelp.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",10
"11","23738. Are the tenants under an obligation to cut peats?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",11
"12","—No; they are under an obligation in this way, that they have been in the habit of doing it during, perhaps, a century, and have continued to do so, and we give them an order at the beginning of the season for the quantity and they endeavour to fulfil that. Most of them produce the quantity, and we dispose of them to the distillers; and the tenants undertake to cut a certain quantity, and prepare them and ship them on board ships.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",12
"13","23739. You pay them so much per quantity?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",13
"14","—Yes.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",14
"15","23740. What is the quantity, a fathom?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",15
"16","—Yes.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",16
"17","23741. How much do you pay per fathom?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",17
"18","—19s.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",18
"19","23742. Has that rate been increased of late?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",19
"20","—No, not within the last ten years; but before that it was.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",20
"21","23743. How much was it when you remember?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",21
"22","—15s.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",22
"23","23744. And it was increased to 19s?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",23
"24","—Yes.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",24
"25","23745. When a man is employed in cutting peats for 19s. a fathom, can he make as good wages as he would do if he were working for hire?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",25
"26","—It is considered that he does; and there is no other labour for him to do then; and it is at a season of the year when his croft is laid down and he is at liberty to work at this.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",26
"27","23746. How much per day can he make at it?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",27
"28","—That is difficult to say, but they have never complained with regard to the wages.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",28
"29","23747. Suppose a man said he would not cut peats, but would rather occupy himself otherwise what would happen to him?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",29
"30","—Nothing, because we have never had any difficulty in that way, we could always get another to do it.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",30
"31","23748. Do they sometimes refuse to do it ?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",31
"32","—They have never absolutely refused to do it. We have always sufficient people without any compulsion being used.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",32
"33","23749. Can you candidly state that if the people preferred not to cut a single peat they would be at liberty to abstain from doing it?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",33
"34","—I cannot say that, because I do not see how they could pay their rent if they did not cut peats. We have money to give them by this means at rent instead of getting money from them.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",34
"35","23750. Generally is there a balance in favour of the tenant?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",35
"36","—Very.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",36
"37","23751. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",37
"38","—What is the rental of Eday?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",38
"39","—The gross rental is about £1560.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",39
"40","23752. How much of that comes from tenants paying less than £20 a year?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",40
"41","—I should think about two-thirds —most of them are crofters.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",41
"42","23753. What is the amount of sales of peat?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",42
"43","—We sell about a 1000 tons to the distillers, and that comes to about 12s. a ton, and leaves 6s. after paying freight. We have always considered it a privilege to the cottars, there being so many upon the island, and their circumstances have been improved by it. I have been astonished by hearing it was a",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",43
"44","grievance, and that is why I have mentioned it. The people are allowed to cut peat and sell it to whom they like on paying the most money, and they do that to a considerable extent and we always took a larger quantity for shipping purposes. I wish to impress upon the Commission that it is no hardship to cut peats.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",44
"45","23754. The Chairman.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",45
"46","—Is there a vast quantity of moss unexhausted?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",46
"47","—A vast quantity.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",47
"48","23755. Do you find any wood in the moss?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",48
"49","—I do, down about 6 or 7 feet, such as birch and hazel.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",49
"50","23756. Are there any indications of these trees which you find in the moss having been cut?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",50
"51","—No they have fallen down, and the moss has grown on the top of them. They are lying flat, and the branches entire. The largest one I got was 3 feet in circumference—a Highland birch.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",51
"52","23757. It looks as if these trees had grown there at a period when there were no inhabitants. I mean there are no traces of the felling of the trees?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",52
"53","—No, they have not been felted, because the roots and branches are there. They seem to have fallen down, and the moss has grown over them.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",53
"54","23758. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",54
"55","—Is it on the crofter's ground that the peats are cut?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",55
"56","—No, there are hill dykes, and it is outside of these that the peats are cut. There is a large quantity cut upon the large farms, but that is one of the conditions of the lease.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",56
"57","23759. Is there any soil below the peat?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",57
"58","—Yes, there is a good sub-soil.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",58
"59","23760. Are you cutting it regularly so as to utilize that?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",59
"60","—Yes, we are laying down a surface.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",60
"61","23761. It would be a good thing, in that case if many parts were deprived of the surface, would it not?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",61
"62","—It would; and it is with that view that it is cut; the tenants work up behind.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",62
"63","23762. The Chairman. ",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",63
"64","—You have seen the sub-soil of the peat actually brought under cultivation?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",64
"65","—Yes, there are a great number of acres where peats have been cut which are cultivated.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",65
"66","23763. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",66
"67","—Who has got those acres?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",67
"68","—The small crofters, many of them, and the proprietor himself on the home farm; and some of the bigger tenants have it, in fact, all have it more or less, and excellent ground it becomes.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",68
"69","23764. Do you require any lime?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",69
"70","—Yes; it does very well indeed : it makes capital soil.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",70
"71","23765. Do you wish to make any other remark?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",71
"72","—That was the principal thing.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",72
"73","23766. Professor Mackinnon.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",73
"74","—Is it because the wives and children of the crofters take part in the peat industry that you are unable to state the wages that they can make?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",74
"75","—No, it is because it furnishes employment for people who are not at the fishing.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",75
"76","23767. But I suppose the women and children are able to do a great deal of the work of spreading and drying the peats?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",76
"77","—They do. Tie men cut them and work them, and drive them down in carts. It is useful employment for people who are not able to go anywhere else. In fact, we have always considered they could not get on without it.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",77
"78","23768. And it pays?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",78
"79","—I think it does. ",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",79
"80","23769. Is the work at the kelp compulsory as well as that at the peats? ",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",80
"81","—I understand it is.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",81
"82","23770. To what extent?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",82
"83","—That we expect they will work it as they have been in the habit of doing before.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",83
"84","23771. Do you consider that also is kept on as much in order to secure payment of rent as to make income?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",84
"85","—We do it for both purposes, and we consider it a better thing; it does not exhaust the raw material as the peat does. The proprietor's property is going away with the peat, but not with the kelp-making.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",85
"86","23772. You heard also about the grievance of the hares?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",86
"87","—Yes.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",87
"88","23773. Have you any remark to make about that?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",88
"89","—The only remark is that they are now strictly preserved; and in regard to the rabbits there is not a tenant injured by them. The rabbit warrens are upon the proprietor's own farms.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",89
"90","23774. Is it the case that the hares came there?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",90
"91","—They came there twenty-nine years ago—six hares.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",91
"92","23775. They must have increased immensely?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",92
"93","—They were well protected at first and they have gone over the whole island; there is a great crop just now.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",93
"94","23776. The crofters seem to consider them a very bad crop?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",94
"95","—But in the district from which the delegates come they are thinning them out very fast,",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",95
"96","23777. Are they at perfect liberty to do so?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",96
"97","—It was understood they were not to injure them at one time; but for some years back they have not been restricted, and there has been a great deal of poaching. But there is no rabbit damage done because the warrens are on the sheep runs.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",97
"98","23778. The delegate told us he was aware the law allowed him to kill a hare upon his croft?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",98
"99","—Yes.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",99
"100","23779. But if the proprietor does not allow him, when he has no lease the law fails?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",100
"101","—They have never got any intimation in any way for years about the hares; the thing was allowed to stand still, and the big tenants always had the right to kill the hares upon their own farms.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",101
"102","23780. And they did it openly?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",102
"103","—Yes.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",103
"104","23781. Did the crofters do it openly?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",104
"105","—-No.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",105
"106","23782. Does not that give an indication of their minds, that they were afraid to do it openly?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",106
"107","—Yes; they could not do it openly unless they had a gun.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",107
"108","23783. By snare?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",108
"109","—That would not be openly.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",109
"110","23784. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie,",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",110
"111","—By poaching you mean killing, not on their own farms, but on other people's?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",111
"112","—Yes.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",112
"113","23785. The account we got from the delegate showed that the crofts were pretty small?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",113
"114","—Yes.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",114
"115","23786. There is a very considerable number of small ones?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",115
"116","—Yes.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",116
"117","23787. A delegate appeared who had a small one?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",117
"118","—He has a large piece of hill which is not cultivated.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",118
"119","23788. Are the tenants fairly comfortable?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",119
"120","—I consider so; I consider they are very much improved.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",120
"121","23789. How many schools are there on the island?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",121
"122","—Two.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",122
"123","23790. Are they convenient for the population? Built for the purpose and efficiently worked?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",123
"124","—Yes.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",124
"125","23791. Male or female teachers?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",125
"126","—Male.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",126
"127","23792. Are the children pretty well kept to school?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",127
"128","—Yes, pretty well",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",128
"129","23793. I suppose it requires a good deal of attention?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",129
"130","—Yes; at certain seasons they attend fairly well.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",130
"131","23794. Has the education certainly improved?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",131
"132","— We had very good education before the Act.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",132
"133","23795. How were your schools supported before the Act?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",133
"134","—The proprietor built the schools and there was a Government inspector of schools, and we were as well situated then as now, only we have larger and more expensive schools.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",134
"135","23796. But still the schools are quite efficient?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",135
"136","—Yes.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",136
"137","23797. In that case both the oldest and youngest people are fairly well educated?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",137
"138","—Yes, I am sorry the representative to-day was not one of the best in respect of education.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",138
"139","23798. The Chairman.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",139
"140","—Do you feel yourself enabled to state at this moment, in unambiguous terms that may reach the crofters of Eday, that they are at liberty freely to kill hares upon their own crofts ?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",140
"141","—I have no authority to make any statement of that kind, because there never has been any conversation between the present proprietor and myself upon it. We have not talked it over yet.",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",141
"142","23799. I was anxious to hear that, because I was afraid some erroneous impression might reach the public?",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",142
"143","—There has been no conversation with regard to that since the Act came into force,",407,"Adam Hoon","Orkney, Sanday",143
