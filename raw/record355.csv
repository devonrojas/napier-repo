"68","20053. Were there many other people also removed at that time?",355,"Robert Robertson","Unst, Baltasound",68

"99","—Yes, I was very well off; it was the best place I was ever in.",355,"Robert Robertson","Unst, Baltasound",99
"100","20068. Was it not a very useful thing in the country to have a lot of the small Shetland sheep?",355,"Robert Robertson","Unst, Baltasound",100

"107","—I believe it is, because in Shetland people are all in the same way.",355,"Robert Robertson","Unst, Baltasound",107

"130","20083. I think I saw a lot yesterday?",355,"Robert Robertson","Unst, Baltasound",130

"136","20086. Were the people who were there well off?",355,"Robert Robertson","Unst, Baltasound",136

"140","20088. Do they keep any cows, or nothing but ponies there?",355,"Robert Robertson","Unst, Baltasound",140

"145","—They have complained very much indeed, because it put them to a great deal of trouble and a worse bargain than where they-were, and that was why they complained.",355,"Robert Robertson","Unst, Baltasound",145
"146","20091. Who is Mr Henderson?",355,"Robert Robertson","Unst, Baltasound",146
"147","—He does not belong to this island, but he has property in it.",355,"Robert Robertson","Unst, Baltasound",147

"152","20094. Are you complaining of your rents?",355,"Robert Robertson","Unst, Baltasound",152
"153","—Yes, I had been complaining of my rent, and he said he would come down somewhat, but he has not said what it was to be.",355,"Robert Robertson","Unst, Baltasound",153
"154","20095. Are your neighbours complaining of the rent?",355,"Robert Robertson","Unst, Baltasound",154
