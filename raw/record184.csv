"1","MURDOCH M'KINNON, Earsary (nearly 60)—examined.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",1
"2","10888. The Chairman.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",2
"3","Have you been freely elected a delegate ?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",3
"4","—Yes.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",4
"5","10889. About how many people were present when you were elected ?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",5
"6","—There are twenty-two paying rent in the place, and the greater part were present when I was elected.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",6
"7","10890 Have the twenty-two all got complete crofts, or are the crofts much subdivided ?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",7
"8","—There are four upon some, three upon others; two upon one croft, and seven undivided.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",8
"9","10891. Have you an undivided croft ?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",9
"10","—I have the fourth part of a croft.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",10
"11","10892. What stock do you keep yourself?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",11
"12","—A horse, a cow, a heifer, and a stirk, but the croft cannot maintain these. I purchase fodder for them. I gave over £2 worth of meal to them last spring, and I must now sell one of these to pay the rent.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",12
"13","10893. What is your rent?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",13
"14","—£2, 5s.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",14
"15","10894. Have you sold a stirk lately ?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",15
"16","—I have sold none for the last two years. I am keeping them in the expectation that we may get more land, and in the event of our getting it I would have some stock for it.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",16
"17","10895. How much did you get for the last stirk you sold?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",17
"18","—£2. It was over twelve months old.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",18
"19","10896. That was not a good price?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",19
"20","—Yery bad indeed. Unless beasts are well fed they will not fetch a good price.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",20
"21","10897. What did the stirks fetch last year?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",21
"22","—Off and on, about £3.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",22
"23","10898. Do you think £2, 5s. is too dear a rent?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",23
"24","—I have cultivated it for the last three years, and I have not taken £ 1 worth of meal out of it, and this last season I did not take out of it so much as would sow it. It was the factor who gave me seed.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",24
"25","10899. How many acres of arable have you got?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",25
"26","—Between l½ and 2 acres.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",26
"27","10900. How much would you consider a good croft fit for a family?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",27
"28","—I am fifty years there, and my father had the whole croft of which I now occupy the fourth part. My father kept six cows upon the croft, and never had to buy any provisions. He was taking his living out of the land.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",28
"29","10901. How many horses and sheep?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",29
"30","—Two horses and twenty ewes. ",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",30
"31","10902. How much rent did your father pay?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",31
"32","—£5. Five families had  the township at that time instead of twenty-two who are there to-day. There were no cottars. There are fourteen cottars to-day in addition to the twenty-two who hold land. The land is now exhausted. We till the same plot every year continuously, and the rain of winter washes the soil away. Although I took no crops out of it last year, I expect a better year this year, and it is necessary to turn it in order to provide some fodder for the cattle.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",32
"33","10903. Is there any good land near your place which might be used to make the crofts larger?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",33
"34","—There is a tack beside us, but perhaps it is too small for the man who holds it. ",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",34
"35","10904. What tack is that ?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",35
"36","—Oleas. If I had land that would yield half as much the amount as I pay for meal I would endeavour to make a living out of it. For eighteen years I paid on an average £20 to the merchant for meal and things to support my weak family. I was thirty-five years ago going to the east coast fishing. I believe I brought over £500 home. I spent the whole of that in meal and other things to support the family, all for want of land. If I had a good croft I would have some of that to leave to those I leave behind. If it were not for the local merchant here, who keeps us all in provisions, no person would be alive in this place at all, and all the stock in the country side is his if he chose to take possession of it—between himself and the proprietor. ",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",36
"37","10905. Is there only one merchant in the place ?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",37
"38","—There are two in Castle Bay, but it is with Mr M'Neill we deal. He is the more liberal to us. ",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",38
"39","10906. Do you pay ready money ?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",39
"40","—He gives us provisions and everything we require, in the expectation that we will get money to pay him for it. Everybody in our place is exactly in the same position as I am.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",40
"41","10907. Do you know a place called Bentangaval?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",41
"42","—Yes. ",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",42
"43","10908. Do you know that that farm was offered in small lots to crofters this year?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",43
"44","—Yes, but I think it would not provide arable land; it would only provide pasture land.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",44
"45","10909. Was it taken up by the people?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",45
"46","—I am not quite certain. I heard it was offered to them by the factor.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",46
"47","10910. If they had not taken it had they good grounds for not going into it ?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",47
"48","—I cannot tell the reason why they took it or why they did not take it.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",48
"49","10911. You yourself were not an offerer?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",49
"50","—No, I did not live in the neighbourhood at all",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",50
"51","10912. If you were complaining of want of land, why did you not come forward and offer for a piece of it?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",51
"52","—I don't think I could take my living out of it.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",52
"53","10913. Is that the reason why it was not taken up?—I believe it is not suitable to provide land that would yield crops: it would yield pasture. ",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",53
"54","10914. Was it made a condition that under certain contingencies the stock of Vatersay would be put upon them ?—I heard that the stock was to be kept upon it if they were able to purchase it, but those who live in",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",54
"55","the neighbourhood know more than I do.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",55
"56","10915. But my question was whether, in the event of the weather being very dry, or there being a scarcity of water or the pasture of Vatersay running short, the tenant of Vatersay would have the power of putting his",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",56
"57","stock upon this land that was offered to the crofters?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",57
"58","—I heard that as one of the conditions.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",58
"59","10916. Mr Cameron.—How far do you live from it?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",59
"60","—About five miles.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",60
"61","10917. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",61
"62","Are you a fisher?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",62
"63","—I always was a fisherman, but not of late.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",63
"64","10918. Whom did you fish for?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",64
"65","—I used to fish for Mr M'Neill, and I fished for a long time for a curer down in our own neighbourhood named M'Caskill.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",65
"66","10919. How are you paid by these curers?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",66
"67","—When we worked for M'Caskill we got 7d. for ling and 3d. for cod. This year ling is 11d . and cod 6d.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",67
"68","10920. Were you fishing for cod this year?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",68
"69","—Not this year. I fished for lobsters.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",69
"70","10921. For whom did you fish lobsters?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",70
"71","—Mr M'NeilL",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",71
"72","10922. What are you getting for lobsters?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",72
"73","—12s. per dozen.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",73
"74","10923. When do you get paid for these fish?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",74
"75","—When we settle up, perhaps at Martinmas next. I don't ask a settlement till the work of the year is over.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",75
"76","10924. Does Mr M'Neill give you credit up to the settlement?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",76
"77","—Yes, he always gives us credit till we make the settlement.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",77
"78","10925. Are you able to clear your account every year?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",78
"79","—We can pay in a good year and in a bad year we cannot, but he allows matters to lie over in the expectation that a good year will come next.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",79
"80","10926. Do you always allow matters to lie over, or if there is a balance in your favour do you get it ?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",80
"81","—Yes, if we have to get money we get it. ",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",81
"82","10927. Do you get it in cash ?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",82
"83","—Ready money in our hands ; but it is very seldom that the balance is upon our side. If our accounts were square we would only be glad. This year we are in great debt ",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",83
"84","10928. When you take goods on credit do you know the price, or is the price left over till the settlement?",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",84
"85","—We know the price when we get it.",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",85
"86","10929. Can you buy your commodities in any shop you like, or are you obliged to deal with Mr M'Neill? —We can buy where we like, if we can pay; Mr M'Neill cannot prevent us",184,"Murdoch Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",86
