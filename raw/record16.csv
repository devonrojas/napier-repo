"21","1049. Will you be so good as to make a statement ?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",21

"52","1064. Are you able to keep it satisfactorily in order?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",52
"53","—Middling well, but I am just doing all the best I can in hope my family will grow up to assist me to keep it in order afterwards; and we hope the Royal Commission would see good to give us some of that land that is wasting in the Isle of Skye to support us.",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",53
"54","1065. Was there a great crowding in of people from other parts into this property ?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",54
"55","—Yes ; as you have heard before. The grazing belongs to Bernisdale, and when Mr Macdonald came into the estate in 1830 he let these two places to tenants, and eight people came from Macleod's country—Roag and Harlosh. They came to the upper Glen, and some from Borve came to this estate, and they rather crowded it.",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",55
"56","1066. What was the reason he took more people in?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",56

"58","1067. Was there anything in this place that attracted the people more than other parts ?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",58

"63","1069. What are the wages which you receive from the proprietor?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",63
"64","— £18 a year and 6½ bolls of meal.",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",64
"65","1070. Do you pay any rent for your croft, or do you get your croft for nothing ?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",65

"67","1071. Have you any other wages besides the money wages and meal ?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",67
"68","— None, save one day of his horses in the spring time to plough my croft.",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",68
"69","1072. Going back twenty years in your recollection, what would have been your wages in the same position or for the same service twenty or thirty years ago?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",69
"70","—From £10 to £12, and perhaps £8.",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",70
"71","1073. With the same amount of meal?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",71
"72","—Yes.",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",72
"73","1074. Then, do you think that a man in your position is better off now than he would have been twenty years ago, or worse off?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",73
"74","—It is a hard question to answer, but I think they were every bit as good on the £10 at that time as they should be to day at £18.",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",74
"75","1075. Explain the reason of that?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",75
"76","—There is more extravagance going among people at this time.",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",76
"77","1076. Is there much tea consumed?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",77
"78","—A great deal.",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",78

"81","1078. Are the female members of the family more extravagant?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",81
"82","— Yes, two times. They require elastic-sided boots instead of laced boots.",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",82
"83","1079. You are a farm servant, or have you got labourers who work under you ? Are you a grieve?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",83
"84","—Just a servant.",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",84
"85","1080. There are no servants under you?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",85
"86","—No.",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",86
"87","1081. Have you anything more to say before you retire? Have you any suggestion to make ?",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",87
"88","—No, that is all we were talking of. That is all our complaint—the land is too little to support us.",16,"Finlay Mcinnes","Skye, Skeabost",88
