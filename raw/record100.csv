"1","JOHN MARTIN, Crofter and Catechist, Camuscross (60)—examined. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",1
"2","5257. The Chairman.",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",2
"3","—Are you a catechist in connection with the Established Church or the Free Church ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",3
"4","—The Established Church. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",4
"5","5258. Have you been freely elected a delegate?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",5
"6","—Yes. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",6
"7","5259. By a large number of people ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",7
"8","—Yes. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",8
"9","5260. The following is the statement from Camuscross:",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",9
"10","—'This seems to be one of the poorest of the townships. It was stated that all the land, both pasture and arable, which they hold, is less than one mile square. On this there are forty-seven families. The lots seem to be considerably smaller than in other townships, being not more than two acres in average. The soil, of course, in consequence is much run out. Only two lots are occupied by more than one tenant, the others being all held by one each; but, owing to their smallness, they are not able to keep any great stock of cattle. One particular case was mentioned, in which eight families had only four acres, and not a beast of any kind. The average rent of each of these is 9s., in addition to which they have to pay for ware, besides assessments of various knds. They have no horses or sheep, and they greatly need more land to enable them to keep these. It was explained that there was a lot for which rent is paid twice over by the holder, and the rest of the tenants. It was proposed and agreed to that John Martin and Lachlan Campbell be appointed delegates from Camuscross.' ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",10
"11","Have you any verbal statement to make in addition to that which has been put in on this occasion ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",11
"12","—Only that the place is so much confined. That is the particular complaint we have to make. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",12
"13","5261. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",13
"14","—You speak of one lot as twice paid for. What is the meaning of that ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",14
"15","—The lot was originally laid out the same as the other lots, and the man who got it did not take it, and the township took that lot again for a passage for the cows, and the rent was laid upon themselves. After that another man got the lot, and the rent was never changed, and the man who got that lot was paying it to the landlord. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",15
"16","5262. The rent of your lots is now 9s. What was it before they took this lot ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",16
"17","—I can only say that since that lot was taken from us, our rents were somewhat increased. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",17
"18","5263. What were your first rents?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",18
"19","—I cannot be sure; only that I know it was raised a little. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",19
"20","5264. How long is it since the lots were laid out?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",20
"21","—I cannot be very sure, but I think it is upwards of sixty years ago. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",21
"22","5265. What do the people of Camuscross live by, as it is evident they cannot live upon their lands?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",22
"23","—Their earnings. Every man is now in a hurry to get the spring work past to be off to his work—to be off to work on sea and land all through the kingdom; and when they return, if their earnings have succeeded well, they pay the shop, and the shopman supplies them on credit, as they require it. There is no doubt it has put them to very great inconvenience and hardship that their holdings were reduced, and the land was exhausted with constant cultivation during the past sixty years. The summing of our lots is two cows each, and the crop that grows upon our lots will not feed these two cows. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",23
"24","5266. Do you pay 9s. for your lot, and these two cows?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",24
"25","—These are small lots. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",25
"26","5267. What is the rent of a lot that whl support two cows ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",26
"27","—From £2, 18s. to £3, 10s. besides dues. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",27
"28","5268. Now, the people go away to work. What wages do they bring back to the country with them on an average ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",28
"29","—That is difficult for me to say—as Providence will deal with them. Some bring less or more than others. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",29
"30","5269. Can you name a sum that would be thought a large sum to bring home?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",30
"31","—I would think between £15 and £18. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",31
"32","5270. And how long has a man to absent himself from home to secure that1?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",32
"33","—From five to thirteen months. The one whose earnings did not succeed very well might only have to stay away four or five months. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",33
"34","5271. Now, as far back as you remember, when people used to go away did they bring back the same amount of money as they do now, or less money ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",34
"35","—It is getting slacker. It was at fishing that the people made most money, and now the fishing has got slack. They only fish on shares, and some of them in that way may only incur debts. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",35
"36","5272. What do you mean by fishing on shares?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",36
"37","—That the master is giving half the fishing to the crew, and they are paid according to the amount of fish, and if they don't make a good fishing they get nothing. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",37
"38","5273. This refers, of course, to the east coast fishing ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",38
"39","—Yes, and to the south country and everywhere else. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",39
"40","5274. Have any of the people here boats and nets of their own?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",40
"41","— Very few. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",41
"42","5275. Have those who have boats of their own been doing well of late years ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",42
"43","—Middling. The fishing about here during the past two years was not very good, except on two short occasions. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",43
"44","5276. But do the men with boats and nets not go away to Barra, Stornoway, and the north coast fishings or Irish fishings ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",44
"45","—Yes. They go with their own boats to these fishings. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",45
"46","5277. Have they done pretty well of late years?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",46
"47","—Very middling. They did not succeed very well. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",47
"48","5278. You have said that those who go as hired hands, and are paid by shares, have not done so well of late years. Would they have done better if they had had boats and nets of their own ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",48
"49","—That is my opinion, that they would do better if they had fishing appliances of their own. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",49
"50","5279. What would be the cost of a proper boat and nets for a crew of five men ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",50
"51","—I cannot very well speak about that, for it is not my work, but there are some fishermen here who can tell."" ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",51
"52","5280. Have you been long at Camuscross ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",52
"53","—I was there ever since I was born. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",53
"54","5281. Do you notice much difference in the condition of the people there from what it used to be ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",54
"55","—I know that in times gone by it was easier for people to come through than to-day. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",55
"56","5282. Do you think that they are better clothed and better shod than in the times gone bye?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",56
"57","—The clothing and shoes of to-day may be quite as good as the clothing and shoes of my early days, for at that time people were not earning the wages they are now, and the merchants are giving such extensive credit to the people now that the merchant with whom we deal is dealing very freely indeed with the people. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",57
"58","5283. Do you think the people spend more money now-a-days than they used to do when you were young ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",58
"59","—I know that they do. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",59
"60","5284. May that not contribute to the poverty which prevails?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",60
"61","—In the way the people were in my early recollection, the people had to live on whatever they could grow out of their own holdings. Since that time crops began to go back, and then, of course, when they had to buy from the merchants, it must be heavier on them than before. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",61
"62","5285. But had they not a considerable amount of potatoes cultivated in olden times'?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",62
"63","—Yes, in my early recollection. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",63
"64","5286. Is not the meal they have now better food than the potatoes ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",64
"65","— We don't make meal at all now. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",65
"66","5287. But you eat it ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",66
"67","—Yes, when we buy it. We do not grow it. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",67
"68","5288. Did you ever grow any great amount of meal here ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",68
"69","—Yes; but the ground has become so slack that the corn crop has to be used for feeding cattle unthrashed. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",69
"70","5289. Have you about two acres of land yourself ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",70
"71","—Yes. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",71
"72","5290. What is the most meal you can recollect having made off it in one year in byegone times ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",72
"73","—I eannot make that out, the time is so long since I did make meal of it. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",73
"74","5291. Would you make four bolls out of it in the olden time?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",74
"75","—No. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",75
"76","5292. What is your consumption of meal at the present day ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",76
"77","—Three to four individuals, I think, will consume a boll of meal in twenty days, and that will amount to a considerable quantity. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",77
"78","5293. Sixteen bolls in the year ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",78
"79","—Yes ; and sometimes in harvest time they may have some potatoes. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",79
"80","5294. Therefore, even according to the former state of fertility, it would not supply them at all with the amount of meal they need ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",80
"81","—No. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",81
"82","5295. And you need larger crops ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",82
"83","—Yes, but I know that it is the smallness of the holdings of the people that has caused a great deal of the poverty; and if our holdings were somewhat larger we would be more able to stand our credit, and we would be very much the better of it. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",83
"84","5296. How would you propose to enlarge the crofts'?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",84
"85","—That cannot be done without breaking in upon land in the occupancy of others. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",85
"86","5297. Mr Cameron.",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",86
"87","—Has there been much subdivision among the crofts in your township ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",87
"88","—No, our crofts are so small already. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",88
"89","5298. They never were subdivided in old times'?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",89
"90","—No. The land is so sniall that when it happens the son comes to years, he has to go elsewhere. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",90
"91","5299. Are there the same number of crofters that there were ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",91
"92","—Yes, for the past sixty years. I think there are only two lots on which there are two families each, and that is all the difference. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",92
"93","5300. Sheriff Nicolson.",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",93
"94","—You are a native of this parish?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",94
"95","—Yes. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",95
"96","5301. How long have you been a catechist?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",96
"97","—About nineteen years. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",97
"98","5302. I suppose you go up and down regularly through the parish, and are well acquainted with all the townships?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",98
"99","—Yes. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",99
"100","5303. You have heard all the statements that were made to-day? ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",100
"101","—Yes. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",101
"102","5304. So far as your knowledge goes of the circumstances of the people, do you agree with the statements that were made ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",102
"103","—Yes. There may be part of what was said to-day that I may not be very well up in. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",103
"104","5305. Was the condition of the people very bad this winter?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",104
"105","—Yes; They were under great hardships. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",105
"106","5306. Do you know many cases of families here in want of food ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",106
"107","—Yes, some of them, but the merchant here was very favourable to them. I never saw him taking advantage of the people; when they would be hard up he would relieve them. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",107
"108","5307. They got all their meal from his shop, I suppose ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",108
"109","—Yes. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",109
"110","5308. What is the price of it?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",110
"111","—A guinea a boll; that is the credit price. ",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",111
"112","[Transcriber's note: Questions 5309 through 5328 not present]",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",112
"113","the facility of obtaining peats ?",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",113
"114","—Every other township has peat mosses close to them on their own ground. The township in which I am is most inconvenient in that way to the whole of them.",100,"John Martin","Skye, Isle Ornsay",114
