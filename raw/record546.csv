"1","DONALD FRASER, Schoolmaster and Inspector of the Poor (50)—examined.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",1
"2","32480. Sheriff Nicolson.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",2
"3","—How long have you been resident here?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",3
"4","—Twenty-two years.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",4
"5","32481. As a teacher and inspector of poor?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",5
"6","—Yes.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",6
"7","32482. I suppose you are registrar also?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",7
"8","—I am.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",8
"9","32483. You are well acquainted with the people and their way of living?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",9
"10","—Yes, I go occasionally through the parish in the discharge of my duties.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",10
"11","32484. Have you any particulars to tell us in addition to what has been already stated?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",11
"12","—No, I think you have got pretty full statements.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",12
"13","32485. You have heard all that has been said to-day?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",13
"14","—Yes.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",14
"15","32486. So far as you know, have the statements been correct?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",15
"16","—I think they have been pretty correct, on the whole.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",16
"17","32487. Without exaggeration?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",17
"18","—Yes, I think so.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",18
"19","32488. Has the condition of the people improved since you came here?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",19
"20","—I think it is rather the reverse. I find that we require to give a larger allowance to our paupers than when I came here. They live very largely upon their neighbours —the crofters —who are not in a position to assist them.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",20
"21","32489. What is the expense of keeping a pauper now compared with what it was at first?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",21
"22","—When I came here first the aliment for an old woman was about 6s. a month, but I find that we pay about double that sum now, besides clothing and shoes and that sort of thing.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",22
"23","32490. Is there a large number of paupers in the parish?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",23
"24","—We have just about 5 per cent, of the population; about 75 paupers to the population of the parish, which is a little more than 1600.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",24
"25","32491. The Chairman.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",25
"26","— What is the rental of the parish?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",26
"27","—£9700, gross rental.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",27
"28","32492. Sheriff Nicolson.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",28
"29","—Has the average number of paupers increased in accordance with the population?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",29
"30","—No, I think not.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",30
"31","32493. Has the population of this parish decreased considerably?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",31
"32","—It decreased about 200 between 1871 and 1881. I had the charge of the taking of the census on both occasions, and before 1871 it was 1843, whereas at present it is a little over 1600.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",32
"33","32494. Did it decrease in the decade before that?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",33
"34","—Yes, it was going on decreasing.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",34
"35","32495. What has been the cause of the decrease?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",35
"36","—You have heard to-day that a good many were put out of their holdings, and that they left the country; and I suppose that has been going on.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",36
"37","32496. Has there been any voluntary emigration to the south of Scotland?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",37
"38","—Not very much in my time.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",38
"39","32497. And notwithstanding the decrease of the population, the condition",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",39
"40","of those who remained has not improved?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",40
"41","—I don't think so.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",41
"42","32498. What is the reason of that?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",42
"43","—Well, in a part of the parish they are very dependent upon the fishing of Loch Hourn ; and, as they have no land, when the fishing fails them they must necessarily be very poor.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",43
"44","32499. How do you maintain the paupers here ; you have no poorhouse?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",44
"45","—We have some accommodation in the Oban Poorhouse as a test. We don't send paupers there, but we use it as a test. We just give them cash; that is the pauper relief.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",45
"46","32500. You don't make much use of that test?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",46
"47","—We use it in some doubtful cases, not in the parish, but principally for applicants chargeable",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",47
"48","in the south. We use the poorhouse as a test for them ; but we don't send any out of the parish.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",48
"49","32501. Are you satisfied with the educational administration of the parish?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",49
"50","—Oh, yes.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",50
"51","32502. Who are the members of the School Board?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",51
"52","—Mr Macdonald, who was examined to-day, Mr Mundell, Mr Miller, Mr Mackintosh, the hotelkeeper, and Mr Walker, the priest in Morar.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",52
"53","32503. Who are the members of the Parochial Board?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",53
"54","—Much the same. Of course we have all the proprietors as members, and some elected members. Mr Mitchell, who was here, is an elected member, and Mr. Moffat, another large farmer.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",54
"55","32504. Do they hold regular meetings?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",55
"56","—We have just the two statutory meetings, and other meetings as there is cause for them.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",56
"57","32505. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",57
"58","—I believe you are an evicted crofter?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",58
"59","—Yes, I got a croft when I came to Glenelg.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",59
"60","32506. Apart from your own personal matters, can you say that the local administration of the estate for many years has been unsatisfactory to the people of the district?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",60
"61","—I think the local administration has been very unsatisfactory for the last fourteen years or so.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",61
"62","32507. May I say that nothing has been done, directly or indirectly, for the amelioration or benefit of the poorer class of the people, but rather the reverse?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",62
"63","—I am not aware.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",63
"64","32508. There is nothing in the position of Glenelg, so far as the quality of the soil is concerned, or the habits of the people, to prevent them from being very comfortable if the administration were different?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",64
"65","—Quite the reverse, for the soil is very good.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",65
"66","32509. And the people?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",66
"67","—They are very industrious, but there is no work in the district, and that is a drawback too.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",67
"68","32510. It may be said, then, that not only has nothing been done for them, but the local administration has been against them?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",68
"69","—Very much.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",69
"70","32511. Supposing that the administration had continued, what would the result have been?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",70
"71","—It is hard to say.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",71
"72","32512.. Still greater poverty?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",72
"73","—No doubt of it.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",73
"74","32513. And still greater discontent?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",74
"75","—Certainly.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",75
"76","32514. From what we have heard to-day, and what you yourself know, does there appear to be a prospect, in the altered circumstances, of a more pleasant state of matters in the future?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",76
"77","—The people hope so, as the young proprietor is likely to come a good deal amongst the people. The late proprietor was only here once, and that was twenty years ago.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",77
"78","32515. Among other things in connection with the local administration, had it not a tendency to encourage litigation?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",78
"79","—Greatly.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",79
"80","32516. Into which the people were drawn unnecessarily ?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",80
"81","—Yes.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",81
"82","32517. Did you yourself converse with the new proprietor when he was here?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",82
"83","—I did, a little.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",83
"84","32518. Had you any opportunity of representing matters to him ?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",84
"85","—I made no representation whatever to him. I only saw him for a few minutes. He was going away when I happened to meet him at the hotel.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",85
"86","32519. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",86
"87","—You mentioned that the poverty of the people had increased since you came here twenty-two years ago?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",87
"88","—Yes.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",88
"89","32520. And you said you thought it was partly due to the administration of the estate?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",89
"90","—Yes, because the people get no work to do.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",90
"91","32521. Was there any alteration generally in the size of the holdings?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",91
"92","—No, no great alteration; only some people were deprived of their lands, which were taken possession of by the local factor.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",92
"93","32522. That has not been to any great extent?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",93
"94","—Not to any great extent.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",94
"95","32523. It is only rated at £ 10 a-year?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",95
"96","—But he had the value of £30.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",96
"97","32524. In a large estate that is not much. You said you partly attributed the poverty of the people to the bad fishings, has the fishing in Loch Hourn been bad?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",97
"98","—It has been remarkably good for the last two years, but for a series of years prior to that it was very poor.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",98
"99","32525. Do you remember its being better when you first came to the country?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",99
"100","—It was pretty good for some years.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",100
"101","32526. How many years did it remain so?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",101
"102","—They always got a few herring, but for several years only a very small quantity.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",102
"103","32527. And you think it is principally owing to that that the poverty of the place has increased?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",103
"104","—I think so.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",104
"105","32528. And you think also that the want of the rental of the estate being spent on the property has had much to do with it?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",105
"106","—Yes.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",106
"107","32529. Professor Mackinnon.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",107
"108","—Is this local factor, of whom we have heard so much, in the country now?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",108
"109","—No ; he has, fortunately, gone.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",109
"110","32530. Where is he?",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",110
"111","—I don't know.",546,"Donald Fraser","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",111
