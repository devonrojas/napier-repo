"3","36254. Professor Mackinnon.",600,"Malcolm Mclachlan","Argyll, Lochaline",3
"4","—Have you a statement to make for the place which you represent?",600,"Malcolm Mclachlan","Argyll, Lochaline",4
"5","—I have.",600,"Malcolm Mclachlan","Argyll, Lochaline",5
"6","—Barr. The crofts of Barr are situated on the western shore of Lochteagus, an arm of Lochsunart, which penetrates about three miles inland in a southerly direction. These crofts are on the estate of Glenmorven, now in the hands of Miss Beattie's trustees. The whole of this estate, with the exception of a few worthless patches held by crofters, is one large sheep farm, presently occupied by Captain Shaw, son of Sheriff Shaw of Lochmaddy. Our grievance is that the small spots of arable land held by us is becoming quite worthless through overcropping. It is now about eighty years since our fathers settled in this place, whither they were removed from good land to make room for sheep. They reclaimed the land, such as it is, from being a miserable patch of bog. The water is carried away by open drains, which must be dug very deep. We would improve the land by stone drams, but, as we are tenants at will and can be removed at any tune, we are prevented from making many improvements. Our summing is two cows with followers, and we pay a rent of £ 7 sterling for that and our miserable patches of land. The produce of our crofts will not feed us more than three months of the year. We plant five barrels of potatoes and four bushels of corn; but the land is so much exhausted that it will not yield a good crop. We want to get as much land as we can make a living by, which if we get we are able to stock. There is nothing to be made by herring fishing in this district now, as owing to the way the fishing is prosecuted on the west coast it never comes into Lochsunart. We get work for about fifty days throughout the year from Captain Shaw the farmer; we are paid at the rate of two shillings a day. We have also to complain of having to live in very bad houses, which if we are to live here any longer we should like repaired or rebuilt. We consider our rent is excessive, and would beg respectfully to draw the attention of the Commission to the rents we pay and to our summing, which, taken along with the quality of the arable land we hold, we consider that no capitalist farmer in the Highlands pays the same rent in proportion.",600,"Malcolm Mclachlan","Argyll, Lochaline",6
