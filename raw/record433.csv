"1","Rev. THOMSON MACKAY, Parish Minister, Tongue (35)—examined.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",1
"2","25884. The Chairman.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",2
"3","—How long have you been minister in your present charge?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",3
"4","—For seven years. ",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",4
"5","25885. Were you here yesterday?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",5
"6","—I was.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",6
"7","25886. Did you hear the evidence that was given?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",7
"8","—Every word of it.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",8
"9","25887. Would you be so kind as to make any remarks which occur to you in connection with the evidence?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",9
"10","—I may remark that I have not been appointed a delegate, but in respectful obedience to the Commission I am willing to give any information I can. With respect to the evidence, I think the holdings are too small as a rule. Through the constant application of sea-ware the land is exhausted. They must use the sea-ware. If a larger holding could be given to the crofters whereby parts of the land could get rest, the people would be in comfort, but the land is exhausted every year with sea-ware. I am of opinion that the less sea-ware they would use the better, but in present circumstances they must use sea-ware to force a crop out of the land.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",10
"11","25888. We heard a good deal stated about the effect of the wind upon the crofts, and the loss of crop by wind and stress of weather. Is that the case in your neighbourhood?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",11
"12","—It was the case last year.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",12
"13","25889. Is it frequently the case?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",13
"14","—Not in the Tongue district, with which I am best acquainted.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",14
"15","25890. The smallness of the croft is a disadvantage?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",15
"16","—I think so.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",16
"17","25891. What do you think of the facilities that exist for enlarging the area of crofts—could that be done in your district?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",17
"18","—It could not be done without taking the landlord's interest into consideration.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",18
"19","25892. Could the crofts be enlarged by adding to them on their own borders from other lands; or would it be necessary to take the people and transplant them elsewhere?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",19
"20","—It would be necessary to transplant them elsewhere.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",20
"21","25893. What do you think about the scale of rental?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",21
"22","—I have been a minister in Argyleshire for half a year, in the island of Ulva, and I was a student missionary in the island of Tyree, and also assistant to the late Rev. John Macleod of Morven, and I consider that the rents of the crofters in Argyllshire are much higher than the rents of the crofters in the Reay country. But the Argyllshire men on the other hand have steamboat communication, and can send their produce direct to the market; any produce in the shape of eggs and dairy produce they can send to the best markets in the south, We have no steamboat communication in the north.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",22
"23","25894. Comparing the stock kept by the crofters in the two countries, is the stock here superior or inferior?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",23
"24","—The breed here is inferior, but the people have more cattle.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",24
"25","25895. Do you see any improvement in the breed since you came here ?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",25
"26","—Not much.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",26
"27","25896. We heard yesterday that the Duke was in the habit of keeping a good bull or bulls for improving the breed?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",27
"28","—I do not think there is one of that kind in my neighbourhood.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",28
"29","25897. Do you think the accommodation in the houses is such as to be prejudicial to the health or morals of the people; or are they sufficiently and decently housed?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",29
"30","—They are sufficiently and decently housed.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",30
"31","25898. Better than in the Western islands?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",31
"32","—Yes.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",32
"33","25899. Mr Cameron.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",33
"34","—What is the general condition of the crofters in your district as to means of comfort?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",34
"35","—On the whole with the most of them it is a struggle for existence.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",35
"36","25900. Do you find some of them are poorer than others, or are their means pretty much the same?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",36
"37","—They are poorer, but there are degrees of poverty amongst them.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",37
"38","25901. Do you find that those who are comparatively well off are willing to assist their poorer neighbours in times of distress?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",38
"39","—Yes.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",39
"40","25902. How many of the people have got relations in the colonies?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",40
"41","—Not many in the colonies. There are some, but not many.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",41
"42","25903. Did many of the people emigrate to America?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",42
"43","—A few, but not very many.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",43
"44","25904. What class of people chiefly emigrate?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",44
"45","—Chiefly young men.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",45
"46","25905. Are they generally dissuaded from doing so by their parents, or do their parents encourage the ideal?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",46
"47","—There is a tie of natural affection between mother and son; she is unwilling to part with her son.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",47
"48","25906. And does she push it to the length of preventing young men from going abroad to better their position; or is it simply an expression of natural affection?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",48
"49","—The expression of natural affection.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",49
"50","25907. You state that the lands on the borders of the crofts would not be available for enlarging the area of the crofts; what is the nature of the lands on the borders of the crofts—in whose occupation is it ?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",50
"51","—Sheep farms.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",51
"52","25908. Why in your opinion would it not be suitable for enlarging the crofts?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",52
"53","—The present interests are concerned, it would be a matter of time.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",53
"54","25909. But if the Duke chose when the leases of these farms are out, could he not take, with advantage to the crofters and without any great disadvantage to himself, a portion of these farms so as to enlarge the holdings of the crofters?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",54
"55","—The question of rents comes in there.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",55
"56","25910. Have you ever considered the question of comparing the rents paid by crofters with the rents paid by large sheep farmers for a similar quality of ground?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",56
"57","—No, I have not studied that.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",57
"58","25911. Then you are not in a position to give an opinion as to the rents paid by one class as compared with the other. Do you think that the crofters pay on an average as high rents for a similar quality of land as the large sheep farmers do?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",58
"59","—Yes, I think that.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",59
"60","25912. Then, in that case, the Duke would not be a loser, would he, if he let a portion of these farms to the crofters?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",60
"61","—I do not think so.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",61
"62","25913. Have you ever had any conversation with the large farmers themselves on the subject?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",62
"63","—I have.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",63
"64","25914. What do you find their opinion to be about it? Do they, in conversation with you, think it possible that without altogether spoiling the remaining portion of the large farm, some of it might be added to the crofters' lots as opportunity offers?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",64
"65","—Not as a rule; they do not think so. They think it pays the Duke better to have large farms. ",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",65
"66","25915. I am not so much referring to that as to whether in their opinion the occupation of the large farm could be carried on profitably by them as tacksmen if a portion were taken away and added to the adjacent crofts?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",66
"67","—I do not think that they would approve of that.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",67
"68","25916. Do you know on what account ?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",68
"69","—Probably on the grounds of selfish interest.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",69
"70","25917. Have you ever heard it stated that one difficulty in the way might be—I am talking of the country which you know and I don't —that it would be difficult to keep the sheep on the upper or higher lands if the low grounds used for wintering were devoted to other purposes ?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",70
"71","—I have never heard the question put in that shape.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",71
"72","25918. Do you think from the nature of these large farms in the vicinity of Tongue, that a portion might be allotted to crofters and yet leave a sufficient portion available for wintering so as not altogether to interfere with the proper working of the large farm?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",72
"73","—I do not think that could be carried out if the sheep farming system is to be continued; they must have low and high ground, and if the crofter system is to be continued they must have the same.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",73
"74","25919. Could these large farms in the vicinity of Tongue be so redistributed so that a portion of the high ground and a portion of the low ground could be left with the farmer, and a portion of the high ground and a portion of the low ground given to the crofters—could that be worked?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",74
"75","—I think so.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",75
"76","25920. In that case would it not meet the objection which you stated to the Chairman that the lands adjacent to the crofts were not available for adding to the crofts?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",76
"77","—Yes.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",77
"78","25921. What I mean is this —are the large farms so situated that they might be divided longitudinally, reducing the size, but giving a proportion to the crofters, and not taking away merely the low ground and adding that to the crofter, and leaving the high ground without anybody to occupy it?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",78
"79","—I think the two would be mutually exclusive. I think it must be either a sheep farm entirely or a croft entirely— a fairly large holding.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",79
"80","25922. I understand you to mean that if anything was done by the Duke in the direction asked for by the people, he would require to take the whole of the large farm adjacent and devots it exclusively to crofting; it could not be left partly in a large farm and partly given to a crofter?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",80
"81","—It would be a difficulty, whether large farmers would come forward and bid for holdings of that kind, if the large farms were divided. It would interfere with freedom of contract.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",81
"82","25923. I am talking about what in your opinion the Duke might do voluntarily of his own accord. Supposing you were in the position of the Duke, do you think, from your knowledge of the country, that a re-arrangement might be made so as to afford satisfaction to the people without any considerable sacrifice of rent on the part of his Grace?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",82
"83","—As a question of rent I could not give au exact answer.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",83
"84","25924. In your opinion, if it were done at all the large farms should b3 altogether devoted to crofters or left as large farms?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",84
"85","—Quite so.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",85
"86","25925. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",86
"87","—You spoke about young men emigrating from the neighbourhood, is there really any prospect in the parish here for an active young man, a member of a crofter's family?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",87
"88","—In present circumstances I could not conscientiously advise young men to remain in this north country.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",88
"89","25926. There is no prospect for them in their own country at present?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",89
"90","—I could not advise them to remain here.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",90
"91","25927. Supposing there was a strong young man who wanted to remain in the country and to get a small holding of his own, and he went to the authorities and asked for it, what reply would he probably get?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",91
"92","—A new holding or an old one?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",92
"93","25928. A new holding?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",93
"94","—He would probably get the reply that there was no land for him.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",94
"95","25929. For him?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",95
"96","—For him.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",96
"97","25930. Professor Mackinnon.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",97
"98","—I suppose you know the whole parish of Tongue?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",98
"99","—Yes.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",99
"100","25931. And the neighbouring parish of Durness?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",100
"101","—Yes.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",101
"102","25932. Between the land occupied by crofts and the land occupied by big farms, do you say that the low ground and high ground are about equally distributed between them; in all the big farms is there a good aid of low ground suitable for cultivation?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",102
"103","—Yes.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",103
"104","25933. Is there much about the same proportion of ground suitable for cultivation upon the big farms as there is upon the crofts around us here —pasture and arable combined?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",104
"105","—Yes, and better land, more fertile land.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",105
"106","25934. Do you know about the relative rent that is being paid acre for acre, high and low, arable and pasture, between the crofter and big farmer?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",106
"107","—No. I have not studied that.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",107
"108","25935. But your opinion is that the crofter pays about as much as the big farmer?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",108
"109","—For the extent of his land my opinion is that he pays fully as much.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",109
"110","25936. I happen to have a paper here which just exactly agrees with that. Taking pasture land and arable land, the crofter pays 10d. per acre and the large farmer pays 10¼d. You think that the low ground suitable for cultivation on the big farms, and now out of cultivation, is at least fully as good if not better than the low ground cultivated by crofters?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",110
"111","—I think so.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",111
"112","25937. Do you think that the pasture ground occupied by the big farmers is as good as the pasture ground occupied by the crofters? ",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",112
"113","—It is as a rule better, but I daresay the crofters themselves, owing to the taking off divots and turf and so on, spoil their pasture.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",113
"114","25938. The crofters' pasture would be worse although naturally it was the same?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",114
"115","—Yes.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",115
"116","25939. But you think the big farmers' ground is naturally equal to the small crofters' ground?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",116
"117","—Originally they might be much about the same, but now the big farmers' ground is better.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",117
"118","25940. So that it is worth the farthing extra?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",118
"119","—Very likely.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",119
"120","25941. Then if each big farm, paying say a rent of £1200, has a fair proportion of ground suitable for cultivation, and its proportion of high hill land, would there be anything in the nature of things except the expense of fencing to prevent the farm being split up into two parts high and low together, leaving a big farm upon one side of the fence and distributing the ground on the other side among crofters?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",120
"121","—I think that would work.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",121
"122","25942. Mr Cameron.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",122
"123","—I understood you to say that it would not work?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",123
"124","—I mean that it would not work as at present.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",124
"125","25943. I understood you to say that the sheep farms either should be left as sheep farms altogether or devoted to crofters altogether, and that they could not be divided in the way I suggested; but now you say you think it might be done?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",125
"126","—I misunderstood you.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",126
"127","25944. Professor Mackinnon.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",127
"128","—There is nothing except the cost of erecting a fence to prevent such au arrangement being made if the authorities were willing to do so?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",128
"129","—The stocking of the ground would be a difficulty.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",129
"130","25945. Are there many crofters throughout these two parishes of Tongue and Durness who would be able to bear the expense of removing to one of these places if they got it?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",130
"131","—A number I think would make sacrifices to enable them to occupy such a holding.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",131
"132","25946. Is there a number of them who, after making a sacrifice, would be able with reasonable expectation of carrying it out, to do that?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",132
"133","—A few of them—perhaps not many—with outside assistance.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",133
"134","25947. From your knowledge of the people, in the country and out of it, do you think that there might be a reasonable expectation of outside assistance?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",134
"135","—Do vou mean Government assistance?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",135
"136","25948. I was rather alluding to voluntary assistauce from friends; but put it that way if you like?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",136
"137","—Friends would help in some cases.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",137
"138","25949. I suppose you know the feeling of the people is very much in the direction of getting more land?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",138
"139","—Very much.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",139
"140","25950. We heard yesterday and to-day too, and from yourself also, that the croft for its acreage cannot be said to be too highly rented?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",140
"141","—As a rule, but there may be exceptions.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",141
"142","25951. We heard also that practically there have been no evictions for a great number of years past?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",142
"143","— Practically.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",143
"144","25952. Still the people ask for security of tenure?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",144
"145","—Yes, they do.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",145
"146","25953. And compensation for improvements?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",146
"147","—Yes.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",147
"148","25954. Do you think it is a genuine feeling in the minds of the people that that would be a very desirable thing to get?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",148
"149","—They want security of tenure, partly I think so that the landlord may not be in the position to raise the rents periodically.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",149
"150","25955. What benefits do you think yourself might reasonably be looked for if security of tenure and compensation for improvements were secured to the people by right?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",150
"151","—It might induce the great bulk of them to take more interest in their holdings if they had compensation. If they were aware they were to have compensation in the event of their leaving",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",151
"152","the holding. ",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",152
"153","25956. You think they would make the best of their holdings then?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",153
"154","—Yes.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",154
"155","25957. And would work them better than they work them now?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",155
"156","—They work the arable land well enough already, but they might trench more new land. In fact they work their crofts too well in some cases, because they use too much sea-ware.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",156
"157","25958. And you think relative to the south, even allowing for the advantage of steamboat communication, this place is not too highly rented?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",157
"158","—I don't think so.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",158
"159","25959. So that the great grievance is not the rent but the smallness of the croft?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",159
"160","—No, it is not the rent. Some of them would be poor even although they had the land for nothing.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",160
"161","25960. And you think that if the croft was twice or three times the size that would not be the case?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",161
"162","—I think they would be in comfort if the holdings were enlarged.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",162
"163","25961. Do you think if parties were willing to do it, there is plenty of suitable land in the country to give the people such a croft as that?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",163
"164","—I think so.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",164
"165","25962. I see there has been no subdivision to speak of for a number of years back in this place?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",165
"166","—Not much that I know of.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",166
"167","25963. Do you think that if the people got these big crofts there would not be a danger of subdividing the crofts and making them small again?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",167
"168","—There would need to be a sine qua non that there should be no subdivision.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",168
"169","25964. And you would secure that by quite as firm a right as you would secure tenure and compensation?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",169
"170","—Yes; if Government interference at all is to be allowed  in this case, I think it might be allowed to preven the subdivision of crofts. I know there is a difference of opinion as to Government interference.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",170
"171","25965. I observe that although the area of the crofts has remained the same for thirty years under the present management, both the cattle and sheep of the crofters have decreased in number; were you aware of that?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",171
"172","—No.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",172
"173","25966. Do you think it could be accounted for by the people having heavier beasts than before?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",173
"174","—No, I do not think the breed has improved ; but perhaps their pasture has deteriorated by their taking away divots, turf, and peats.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",174
"175","25967. In the two parishes you mentioned do you think the land is equally as good for arable cultivation as in the island of Tyree?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",175
"176","—Tyree is a very fertile island.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",176
"177","25968. But in the matter of housing and general condition the people of this country are probably, taking all in all, superior?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",177
"178","—Taking all in all they are very comfortable tenants in Tyree but there are a great many poor people, as poor as anywhere.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",178
"179","25969. They are less equal in their circumstances there than here, some are better off and some worse off?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",179
"180","—Yes, better off and worse off.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",180
"181","25970. The Chairman.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",181
"182","—You have been asked a number of questions with reference to the extension of the croft and the division of sheep farms. I would take the liberty of asking you whether the replies which you have given upon these points have been the result of previous inquiry and deliberation, or whether you have been answering as it were on the spur of the moment without previous preparation?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",182
"183","—I have studied the question during the recent agitation about the crofting system. I had not paid much attention to the subject until the recent agitation.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",183
"184","25971. But has that particular point been presented to your consideration before, of the division of a large sheep farm in its whole length, dividing both pasture and arable land, and the restoration of a portion of it to the crofter—has that particular point been before you previously?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",184
"185","—Recently, I have thought of that.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",185
"186","25972. You have stated that there is a general desire on the part of the people for an increase of the area of their crofts, for fixity of tenure, and for compensation?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",186
"187","—I have found when I have been moving about among the people that they want these things.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",187
"188","25973. Have you been aware that these feelings and wishes have been entertained in past years—for a long time past —or do you think they are the result of recent discussion and agitation ?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",188
"189","—They may have lain dormant in former years; the thing has been quickening by recent agitation.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",189
"190","25974. You think that the same wants have been almost unconsciously felt before, but were not expressed so much?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",190
"191","—Quite so, not expressed.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",191
"192","25975. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",192
"193","—I think you stated that you wished to say something?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",193
"194","—I wished to say that this north country is very badly off for steamboat communication, and for want of piers, I do not mean a harbour of refuge as some delegate stated yesterday, but piers at which a small steamer could land and discharge goods—piers at which fishing boats could be securely moored. I think there is traffic enough to keep a small steamer going, say for Strome Ferry to Thurso, right round the coast.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",194
"195","25976. And you wish some calling place for the steamer?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",195
"196","—Yes, I do.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",196
"197","25977. What place would you suggest as the most suitable for the two parishes you have been referring to?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",197
"198","—There is one on the Melness side already, and I do not think it would cost very much. On the Tongue side there is a tidal ferry at the place where the pier would be most convenient, but perhaps it would not be so easy to make a harbour there. ",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",198
"199","25978. But there are places where it could be done?",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",199
"200","—There are. I think it was stated also by the delegate that there is no right mill in the parish of Tongue. The little surplus bere the crofters have, many of them have to carry seventeen miles to get it turned into wholesome bere meal.",433,"Rev Thomson Kackay","Sutherland, Bettyhill",200
