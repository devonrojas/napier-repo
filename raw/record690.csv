"1","RODERICK MACLEAN, Factor, Ardross (54)â€”examined.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",1
"2","41571. The Chairman.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",2
"3","â€”You wish to read a statement to us?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",3
"4","â€”Yes, I wish to supplement a statement I made at Loch Alsh. ",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",4
"5","In giving my evidence at Loch Alsh on the 2nd August, I was asked how much of the Â£86,867 laid out by Sir Alexander on improvements for tenants on his west coast estates, was for the benefit of crofters paying under Â£30 of rent? While my examination was going on, the papers were put into the hands of an assistaut, who unfortunately summed up one branch only, amounting to Â£6000 odds. The correct sum is, however, Â£22,139, 10s. 9d., of which Â£20,116, 16s. was laid out for 114 of the larger crofters, making an average of Â£176, 9s. 3d. for each, and Â£2022, 14s. 9d. for 188 crofters occupying smaller holdings, making an average of Â£10, 15s. 2d. for each. For thÃŒ3 large amount expended Sir Alexander's return is merely nominal, since the rent roll shows an increase of only Â£187, 8s. 3d. on the rents of 114 large crofters, and a decrease of Â£38, 5s. 7d. on the rents of the 188 smaller crofters, thus making the nett increase only Â£149, 2s. 8d., equal to 13s. 6d. per cent, for the outlay of Â£22,139. These figures need no comment. They plainly show that Sir Alexander's desire is to benefit his people. I regret, however, to say that all of them do not show corresponding gratitude. In my former evidence I mentioned the system of division of property which Sir Alexander advocates and acts upon, and I take this opportunity of stating the success of this system on his estates in Easter Ross. Leaving out the estates of Balintraid, Delny, Obsdale, Culcairn, and Millcraig, though conspicuous by the great improvements made upon and additions to them, there is but little change in the number of large farms and crofts, but on the rest of his estates in Easter Ross, purchased from the Duke of Sutherland in 1845, the change is remarkable. When he came into possession in 1845, the lands were occupied by twenty-six tenants, one tenant paying Â£935, one Â£409, one Â£150, one Â£68, six from Â£32, 10s. to Â£38, 12s., and sixteen crofters from Â£ 1 to Â£26. In a few years the whole was remodelled, all the improvable lands brought under cultivation, farm steadings erected, roads made, and large portions judiciously planted; in a word, the whole district so beautified as to be the admiration of every visitor, and the lands occupiedâ€”besides the home farmâ€”by forty-four tenants, of whom one pays Â£400, six from Â£110 to Â£230, sixteen from Â£30 to Â£68, thirteen from Â£ 10 to Â£18, and eight from Â£4 to Â£7. But what I wish to notice specially is the manner in which he dealt with the large farm, which paid a rent of Â£935. Considering it too large a holding in the possession of one person, in 1846 he bought up the remaining years of the lease, and without occupying your time in giving details of progress, I at once state that in a few years it was occupied by one tenant now paying Â£400, one Â£130, one Â£125, nine from Â£32 to Â£68, twelve Â£ 10 to Â£18, and six from Â£4 to Â£7, thirty in all, and comfortable in their respective positions. Six of the above tenants occupy one club farm, and two another.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",5
"6","41572. How many holdings altogether?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",6
"7","â€”Thirty. The extreme west portion of this large holding called Dibidale, he partially forested and partially kept in his own hands as a summer grazing for sheep, it being too subject to severe winter storms to be occupied by a tenant. In 1782 the last resident tenant was starved out, and a shepherd who herded there from 1838 to 1859 told me that the place was re-stocked thrice during the time the Duke was proprietor, â€”the severe winter having destroyed the sheep.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",7
"8","41573. Mr Cameron.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",8
"9","â€”What do you mean by that?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",9
"10","â€”They died out; the severe winter storms having destroyed the sheep.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",10
"11","41574. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",11
"12","â€”At Ardross?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",12
"13","â€”Dibidale, at Ardross. The sheep all died out with the storms, and had to be three times re-stocked in twelve years.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",13
"14","41575. Mr Cameron.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",14
"15","â€”Do you mean the whole stock was cleared away?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",15
"16","â€”That is the shepherd's information â€”that he had to purchase hundreds, and put them on three times during the twelve years. I may say, to confirm it, that the gamekeeper who is there now, to my knowledge, within the last five or six years, during very severe winter storms, drove the deer that are there now from the low ground as quiet as a herd of sheep; they were so reduced by the winter stormâ€”the snow perhaps four or five feet deep, and sometimes ten feet in some parts. And Sir Alexander, finding the portion in his own hands unprofitable, forested the whole in 1869. There is also an outlying portion of the estate situated to the north of Ardross named Amatuatua, which he has reclaimed, and on which he has erected new buildings twenty years ago, occupied by nine tenants as a club farm, paying rents from Â£13 to Â£25, and one paying Â£2. All Sir Alexander's crofters on his east cost estates, being industrious, are comfortable. It is arrangements similar to the above that Sir Alexander is desirous to carry out on his west coast estates. His property in Loch Carron he has got organised â€”where there are, one tenant paying Â£220, one Â£120, two in a club Â£60 each, nine in a club Â£25, 5s. each, nine in a club average of Â£14, 6s. each, eight individual holdings from Â£6 to Â£24, four from Â£ 1 , 10s. to Â£3, and one a nominal rent of 5s.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",16
"17","41576. The Chairman.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",17
"18","â€”On what farm was this?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",18
"19","â€”Loch Carron.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",19
"20","41577. That is the subdivisions which you mention now?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",20
"21","â€”They exist now.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",21
"22","41578. But were they in substitution of another distribution, or have they always been so?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",22
"23","â€”No, they were not. He broke them down. He had no difficulty in carrying out bis plan here, as at the time the estate came into his hands there was room for more occupants, and nine have been introduced at Attadale and Strathcarron station. On his estates in the parishes of Lochalsh, Kintail, and Glenshiel, there are twenty crofter townships, of whom only six are on a satisfactory footing. The other fourteen cannot be organised on account of the excessive number of occupants, for whom he has no land to keep them always employed. I attribute to intermittent labour, and to a certain extent climatic lassitude, the cause of the laziness of which the west coast Highlanders are accused. I have observed that away from home and among working people they become excellent workers, but on their return to their homes they become infected by the indolent surroundings, and especially during the winter months, inactivity is a matter of course with them. If however, taken in hand when young, and kept in regular employment even at their homes, better workmen, circumstances considered, could not be desired. Uneducated Highlanders have a strong attachment to localities, and hence their antipathy to emigration; in many instances they would rather suffer starvation than leave their homes even for a season's work, but the world knows what educated Highlanders abroad are. Education therefore, with more zeal, is one of the principal requirements to elevate them from their present impoverished condition. It would be a great blessing to many of the poor women to have lady missionaries (though difficult to accomplish) sent among them to give them instruction in the training of their families and in domestic economy. As a result of improper training, one painfully experiences in business one-sided statements, probably unwittingly, given as facts, and I believe it is by influences such as the above they could best be got at to practise the duties belonging to their several relations and stations. The well-regulated families among them are easily distinguished and pleasant to deal with. Highlanders are naturally imitative, and are more apt to follow leaders either for good or for evil than to think for themselves. Present occurrences show how applicable to the majority of them is one of Locke's miscarriages in reasoning, viz.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",23
"24","â€”' The first is of those who seldom reason at all, but do and think according to the example of others, whether parents, neighbours, ministers, or who else they are pleased to make choice of to have an implicit faith in, for the saving of themselves the pains and trouble of thinking and examining for themselves.' The knowledge of agriculture among the crofters is far behind the age. To remedy this evil it might be worth the consideration of proprietors to select energetic natives on their respective estates, whom they would get trained in the theory and practice of Highland farming, to be ground officers, who would have constant supervision over crofters till trained. On the west coast they have to contend with climatic changes which are not experienced on the east coast, so that the same practice is not applicable to both. Squatting is a great evil, and often a source of annoyauce in the management of Highland property. No one should have a possession without paying rent, however small. Last Whitsunday an occurrence took place which put one of Sir Alexander's farmers in a fix. Not having a ploughman with a family, he allowed a labourer to occupy the house intended for his ploughman, but having engaged a married ploughman previous to Whitsunday last, the labourer was in due form summoned to remove, and another house in the neighbourhood offered to him with materials free to repair it. He told me in presence of his minister that he would remove without having been summoned, but I observed with a shade of that obliquity above referred to, and when on the term day the ploughman came, the squatter would not move, leaving the farmer to do what best he could with his servant. In many instances, if attempts he made to stir up the people, and better ways of management introduced, they are looked upon as innovations, and frequently go under the name of oppression, and in some instances, though they see rules introduced to be for their benefit, they can scarcely realise their position in making breaches upon them. I give an example. Last spring circulars were issued to all Sir Alexander's west coast tenants who have hill grazings, for their guidance in heather burning, with which all as far as I am aware complied, but on two farms on opposite sides of an inland loch fires occurred about two weeks after the last day allowed by law for heather burning. I believed then, and do so still, that both the farmers were innocent, and that the fires were lighted at the instigation of some one with evil intentions, but though I am on terms of intimate friendship with both, to show by example that favour would not extend to any one in an open breach of law, I instructed Sir Alexander's solicitor to write them. One, who is an educated gentleman and not a native, replied at once freeing himself and his servants, and regretting he could not discover the incendiary; the other, who is a decent honest man, but a native, never troubled himself to reply, even though I personally advised him to do so. The more I study the state of the Highlands the more I see of the wisdom of Sir Alexander's plan, which may be summed up in there being a judicious gradation of holdings, and no more people in a district than can earn their livelihood by their industry. On Sir Alexander's east coast estates no one thinks of coming to ask a piece of land. They have the common sense to see it fully occupied. They follow the example of the busy bee, when the hive is too full it swarms â€”the young people go away. In the valley in which Ardross Castle is situated the population was under 130 when the estate came into Sir Alexander's possession. It very soon became populous, but not beyond a manageable number. In the first class school he established there I saw 160 children present at an examination, and through the means of the sound education and industrious training they got, Ardross boys are now to be found in almost all parts of the world in positions of trust. Last July over a dozen young mechanics and labourers left for Queensland in high spirits. A number of youths who have been well educated in the Lochalsh district also have gone abroad, are a credit to their country, and send encouraging reports to their friends. If the same spirit could but be put into more, how great a benefit it would be to themselves, and to those they would leave behind.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",24
"25","41579. Professor Mackinnon.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",25
"26","â€”I should like to ask about the splitting up of this large farm, where only one tenant occupied it some forty years ago, and now it is occupied by thirty; do you think that that practice could be followed with benefit to the proprietor in a considerable number of cases elsewhere?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",26
"27","â€”No; it was a case where the place could be broken up, but there is no other large holding that could practically be broken up.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",27
"28","41580. I had not particularly in view Sir Alexander Matheson's property. Your knowledge of the country is very wide?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",28
"29","â€”My knowledge does not extend beyond that under my own charge.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",29
"30","41581. It was no great loss to the proprietor in this particular case?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",30
"31","â€”Well, he has not gained by it.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",31
"32","41582. I hope he has not lost much by it?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",32
"33","â€”I was not prepared with figures, but I know that the return he has cannot be 1 per cent., because I do not think that the breaking up of large farms will in any way benefit the proprietor. It must be looked upon as the work of a philanthropist.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",33
"34","41583. In the event of its being found not to be a losing matter to a proprietor, and otherwise practicable, you would think the policy in itself would be a wise one?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",34
"35","â€”Yes, I would. ",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",35
"36","41584. Carried on along with the other policy of consolidating the smaller holdings at the other end of the scale?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",36
"37","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",37
"38","41585. That practically is the policy you are endeavouring to carry out?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",38
"39","â€”Yes, in those that he has not got properly organised, because there are a good many there who cannot gain a living by the land, and, consequently, to make them comfortable, two or three holdings ought to be put together to make one comfortable.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",39
"40","41586. So you would increase the very small holdings, and where practicable you would break up the very large ones?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",40
"41","â€”Yes, that is what I would like to see.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",41
"42","41587. When you spoke of keeping in the district only the number of people that could be maintained by their own industry there, had you in view the possibility of some of them going to the fishing, as they are doing from the west coast just now?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",42
"43","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",43
"44","41588. So that the number that could be maintained there by their own industry would be somewhat larger than the number that actually took their livelihood out of the land?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",44
"45","â€”Yes; what I mean is, that those who would make their living by the land would, as far as possible, have no other employment but the land, and those who would make their living by fishing would have only as much land as might keep them at home and yield the grazing of a cow and a few sheep, and let their income be principally from labour either as fishermen or as artizans.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",45
"46","41589. The crofter should have a substantial croft and work it?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",46
"47","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",47
"48","41590. And the fisherman might have a small plot?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",48
"49","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",49
"50","41591. You alluded to a farm here in the upper grounds where the stock was destroyed by winter storms. There was a gentleman here yesterday afternoon who had very considerable experience in his own line of business, and who stated that cattle could live upon the highest ground of Ross-shire during the winter; is that your experience of Ross-shire?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",50
"51","â€”No, they will not live there. That gentleman did not know Ross-shire; at least, he did not know a Ross-shire farm.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",51
"52","41592. With respect to the more general statements you have introduced into this paper at the end, I see you look to the education of the people as the great instrument for putting things upon a satisfactory footing in the future?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",52
"53","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",53
"54","41593. And you think that they will clear away voluntarily so as to leave just a sufficient number in the place to be maintained with comfort?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",54
"55","â€”I have no doubt of that, because experience shows that an educated young man will not remain there. He will think for himself, and when he begins to think for himself he finds it is folly to remain at home, and that it is best for him to go abroad and support himself, and be a help to those who remain behind.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",55
"56","41594. Apart from the management of those estates with which you have to do yourself, do you think that a rearrangement of affairs upon them might not be carried out at the same time with such a movement as that?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",56
"57","â€”Well, I cannot speak from facts, for I don't know them.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",57
"58","41595. Where you find upon a very large extent of land scarcely a holding between Â£4 to Â£600?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",58
"59","â€”Well, I cannot answer directly, because I do not know them.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",59
"60","41596. But your own policy upon your own estate, and if practicable you would think it a wise policy upon other estates, would be a graduated system of holdings?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",60
"61","â€”Of that I have no doubt, but I thought you referred to its being done upon other estates.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",61
"62","41597. No, I refer to the policy?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",62
"63","â€”I have no doubt of that being the right one .",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",63
"64","41598. The complaint of the people themselves all along has been that the actual fact was quite different, â€”that the holdings were exceedingly small and excessively large, and that they wanted to get larger holdings for themselves out of the very large ones that exist?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",64
"65","â€”Well, if that could be doneâ€”if it were practicableâ€”it would be a wise thing to do, but the question is, how can it be done? The proprietor would have to go to the cost of erecting buildings and making perniauent roads. They could not improve the lands themselves. He would have to improve them for them, and it requires a large amount of capital to do so.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",65
"66","41599. You don't think it would be reasonable to expect other proprietors to do what your own proprietor is doing?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",66
"67","â€”Yes, if they had the means to do it.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",67
"68","41600. But it could not be reasonably asked for as a general rule?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",68
"69","â€”Oh, no.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",69
"70","41601. Do you think that with a better system of education the people would emigrate voluntarily?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",70
"71","â€”I have no doubt of it, for I have seen it for thirty years.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",71
"72","41602. Of course, uneducated Highlanders have a strong attachment to localities. You do not mean the educated Highlanders have not that too?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",72
"73","â€”Of course they have it, but not to the same extent.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",73
"74","41603. They have it with a reason?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",74
"75","â€”Yes. What I mean by saying uneducated Highlanders have a strong attachment to localities is that they cannot realise what it is to leave either for their own benefit or the benefit of others; but I believe that every person has a strong attachment to the place of his birth.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",75
"76","41604. A great evil you mention here is squatting. That includes the subdivision of crofts?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",76
"77","â€”-No, I mean people sitting down without paying rents at all. We have 123 of them who pay no rents.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",77
"78","41605. The complaint of the people themselves has been all along that there would be no such thing if these bits of land were given to them?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",78
"79","â€”I cannot say for any outside our own property; but when Sir Alexander Matheson bought the property he found squatters on it.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",79
"80","41606. What would be your remedy for dealing with those squatters?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",80
"81","â€”To make them pay a rent, however small, even Is. They would then be tenants, and would be manageable.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",81
"82","41607. Could you not do that just now?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",82
"83","â€”If you do it just now, Mr Mackenzie, the Clach, would rise up against us, and a good many other people, and say we were oppressors.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",83
"84","41608. Sheriff Nicolson.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",84
"85","â€”To the extent of Is.?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",85
"86","â€”To the extent of Is. They would not pay, because, with the present agitation that has arisen in the Highlands, Highlanders I may say in many places have become quite unmanageable,â€”they are so difficult to deal with. ",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",86
"87","41609. Professor Mackinnon.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",87
"88","â€”Their ignorance of agriculture is stated, and very properly stated, in your paper as a thing that should be attended to. Have you any plan in your own mind as to how that should be remedied?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",88
"89","â€”Yes, I have been thinking of getting strangers in amongst them, but I know from the habits of the people and their mode of thinking that they would not suffer any strangers among them. To use a Gaelic word, the ' macharach' is looked upon as an oppressor among the native Highlanders. They hate him. The same feeling exists in those unbroken parts of the Highlands as it did 200 years ago. I may explain the best plan to get them trained is that proprietors should get some of the native people, intelligent men among the natives, educated to agriculture and farming as applicable to the Highlands, and the people would take instruction from them with much more ease than they would from a stranger.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",89
"90","41610. To send some of the most capable young men to the south or east for a year or two to learn the principles of agriculture, and then expect them to teach their friends when they come home?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",90
"91","â€”Yes. ",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",91
"92","41611. Have you known of anything of that kind being done anywhere? '",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",92
"93","â€”I have had experience of it in Easter Ross, in the club farms there, by getting two or three men who knew how to manage club farms, and the whole is left in their hands; and wherever it is left in the hands of trained men they work admirably. We had experience two years ago of native people who were trained up in one of these club farms, brought up to the club farm without getting training outside. The farm was left in their hands for two years, and it was a loss to themselvesâ€”by being left in the hands of native people who were untrained.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",93
"94","41612. I suppose the management of a sheep farm on the club system is found to be better than when it is separate and independent?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",94
"95","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",95
"96","41613. And when stock is in small quantities among crofters you would prefer that system?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",96
"97","â€”Yes, they would all have an equal interest. The way Sir Alexander does with the arable land they occupy is that they rent it separately, and then the club is rented in common, and each pays a proportion of the grazings added to the rental of the low ground.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",97
"98","41614. I presume you would admit that all other people as well as Highlanders are educated by example more or less?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",98
"99","â€”We are now speaking about the Highlanders.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",99
"100","41615. But Locke would not have had them particularly in view in his theory?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",100
"101","â€”No, but I say he gives other miscarriages than those two, but they are so applicable to the present state of matters that I could not resist giving them.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",101
"102","41616. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",102
"103","â€”Will you tell us something about the forest that was created in Easter Ross by Sir Alexander?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",103
"104","â€”Yes; the extent of it is about 9000 acres.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",104
"105","41617. Is that the only one on the east coast estates?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",105
"106","â€”The only one.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",106
"107","41618. It is called Dibidale?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",107
"108","â€”Yes; I don't think it is so much as I have stated. I would rather not say the figures; I don't think it is 9000.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",108
"109","41619. You mention in your paper that a number of the people went away from the estate in high spirits. I suppose you were in high spirits too?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",109
"110","â€”Well, among them was one of my own sons, and I felt in high spirits that he was so plucky as to go. He went away in June, and in the following July fourteen followed him to Queensland, and I was in high spirits to see him so plucky as to go, and my eldest son wants to follow him immediately.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",110
"111","41620. Is there not a deal of land still in the Highlands that might be profitably reclaimed?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",111
"112","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",112
"113","41621. Why should proprietors and others be so anxious to promote emigration when this reclamation can take place at home?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",113
"114","â€”They can answer for themselves. I cannot answer for others.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",114
"115","41622. But you have just stated that you approve of emigration?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",115
"116","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",116
"117","41623. You think it is better for the people themselves, but you will not say it is better for those that are left behind?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",117
"118","â€”It is better for both. It is better for those who remain behind, because they can have enough to live upon by their industry; and better for those who go away, because there is plenty room in the world outside their little home, and it would be far better for them to exert themselves for their own benefit abroad than at home.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",118
"119","41624 Do you want to stop further improvement and reclamation in the Highlands?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",119
"120","â€”Certainly not.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",120
"121","41625. Who is to do it then?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",121
"122","â€”The people who remain behind.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",122
"123","41626. Where are you to draw the line between those who remain and those who go away?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",123
"124","â€”That depends on circumstances, but one thing unfortunately is that the good will go away and the bad remain behind.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",124
"125","41627. You have rather commented upon the character of the Highlander as distinguished from others?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",125
"126","â€”I have done so because I have experience of it.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",126
"127","41628. You are a Highlander yourself, from your name?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",127
"128","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",128
"129","41629. Don't you think that character is to some extent, if not to a great extent, formed by surrounding elements?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",129
"130","â€”Yes, I do.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",130
"131","41630. Have you heard it stated that some of the alleged weaknesses in Highland character have arisen very much from the way they have been treated, or think they have been treated?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",131
"132","â€”I believe it is so.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",132
"133","41631. And you are willing to admit that that to some extent accounts for defects in their character?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",133
"134","â€”Yes, because they are not elevated as they ought to be. They want elevation.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",134
"135","41632. Do you think it unnatural in any way that the poor crofter has a disinclination to leave his landâ€”the place where he has been brought up? Is it unnatural in him to have such a feeling?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",135
"136","â€”No, it is natural for him to have such a feeling.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",136
"137","41633. And the idea of clinging to one's native soil is by no means an objectionable feeling?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",137
"138","â€”Well, it is objectionable in one way, because so long as he remains there he will be a burden to himself and to others, but if he had the moral power to go away he would be a benefit to himself and a relief to others. It is the raising of the moral nature, the elevating of the moral character, that would make them think for themselves.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",138
"139","41634. You say it is praiseworthy in the Highlander to be attached to his native place, but it would be of advantage for him to go abroad to better himself; do you contemplate that such people should ever return to their own country?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",139
"140","â€”I do, because they would return to their own country independent and assist others, and remain at ease after their hardearned labourâ€”living upon their previous industry, and supporting others.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",140
"141","41635. You approve of their coming back?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",141
"142","â€”Yes, coming back not a burden to their country.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",142
"143","41636. No, not a burden to their country; but you approve of their coming back?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",143
"144","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",144
"145","41637. How many in the crofting class with which we are more particularly connected do come back in independent circumstances? Has it come under your observation?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",145
"146","â€”As far as I remember, three have come back to Ardross after making a competency. They came back from Australia.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",146
"147","4163S. Do you think that a person evicted, to use the expression in its ordinary senseâ€”evicted from his possession â€”must not feel very sore upon the point?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",147
"148","â€”I have not a doubt of it.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",148
"149","41639. And that it will continue for a long period?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",149
"150","â€”Yes, perhaps all his lifetime.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",150
"151","41640. And even longer?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",151
"152","â€”Oh, perhaps not after his death; he would think no more about it.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",152
"153","41641. He might have descendants?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",153
"154","â€”I don't know.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",154
"155","41642. Do you think that the descendants of the constable of Eilean-donan, who lost his head at Inverness about 400 years ago, and lost also his landsâ€”do you think that they were pleased or satisfied until they again got possession?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",155
"156","â€”I don't know the history.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",156
"157","41643. I just wish to ask this further question. In our examination at Lochalsh, Sir Alexander made use of an expression â€”it might be hasty or otherwiseâ€”that although he would not remove them he would be very glad if half of his crofters went away. I am not putting it to you in your factorial capacity, but as an individual â€”do you approve of that statement?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",157
"158","â€”I know there would be a very great benefit to the people themselves if half of them went away. They know it themselves too, but they don't think of moving. Two or three of them early this year spoke to me about going away if they got assistance, but when matters were coming to a point they would not go. Sir Alexander assisted a few privately, and they sent home very encouraging reports, and one thing I may tell, to show that they are getting on well abroad. There was one young man to whom he give a loan of Â£100 two and a half years ago to take him to India, and I am glad to say he has returned the money. Another poor man, to whom he gave Â£20 about ten years ago went away, and he has returned the money.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",158
"159","41644. I must follow that question up a little further. In the case of the person to whom he lent Â£100 to go abroad, would it not have been worth while to have given him Â£100 to try and make something at home?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",159
"160","â€”He could not get anything to do at home.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",160
"161","41645. Why?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",161
"162","â€”Because there was nothing for him. He was a lad of seventeen and a half, and had the pluck to go away at that age to India.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",162
"163","41646. Are you really prepared to say that the state of the Highlands is reduced to this, that there is no opening for a young man with a little ambition?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",163
"164","â€”There is not an opening. You may see from the advertisements that there is not a single opening but perhaps twenty, thirty, or forty are applying for it, which shows that the number of people in need of employment is in excess of the available employment.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",164
"165","41647. Can the state of the country, therefore, be satisfactory?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",165
"166","â€”No, it cannot be when such is the case.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",166
"167","41648. The Chairman.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",167
"168","â€”You mentioned two large farms which had been broken up by Sir Alexander Matheson, one on the east coast, I understand, and the other on the west coast?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",168
"169","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",169
"170","41649. The east coast farm, which was tenanted by one occupier, has been broken up iuto thirty holdings. What is the aggregate rental of these holdings now compared with the original rent of Â£900?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",170
"171","â€”I am sorry to say I did not refer to the valuation roll.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",171
"172","41650. But you can tell me about how much. Is it below or above?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",172
"173","â€”It is slightly above, but not much.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",173
"174","41651. There has been a slight rise of aggregate rental?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",174
"175","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",175
"176","41652. But there has been a large outlay?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",176
"177","â€”A very large outlay.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",177
"178","41653. Will you explain what the description of outlay has chiefly been on the part of the proprietor? Has it been in the construction of dwelling houses, or fencing, or draining, or what?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",178
"179","â€”In the whole of these â€”improving the land, reclaiming it from nature, and building houses and making drains.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",179
"180","41654. First, with reference to the houses, did the proprietor construct the houses entirely, or did he afford materials and did the tenants do the work?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",180
"181","â€”He constructed the houses entirely himself, and for their steadings he gave the materials. That is in the case of the small holdings.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",181
"182","41655. I speak of the small holdings. Then when he constructed the housesâ€”are they stone and lime houses?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",182
"183","â€”Stone and lime.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",183
"184","41656. With two chimneys?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",184
"185","â€”Two chimneys, and some larger.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",185
"186","41657. Did the tenant contribute at all to the creation of the houses by carting materials?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",186
"187","â€”Not a penny.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",187
"188","41658. Without saying a penny, did he do any work towards them?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",188
"189","â€”Nothing.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",189
"190","41659. He fetched nothing to the ground?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",190
"191","â€” Nothing.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",191
"192","41660. For a holding of, say, Â£15 annual value, what was the cost of these dwelling houses built by Sir Alexander?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",192
"193","â€”When he built them labour was much cheaper than it is now, and probably some of these houses would cost about Â£90 on the west coast. A similar house now would cost Â£150 on the west coast.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",193
"194","41661. But I am speaking of an east coast farm entirely?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",194
"195","â€”Well, on the east coast about Â£90.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",195
"196","41662. That would have been for a Â£15 croft?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",196
"197","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",197
"198","41663. Supposing Sir Alexander Matheson had unhappily not been able to undergo this prime cost of the houses, do you think that a worse house, but still, in the first instance, a tolerable house, could have been put up by the same class of tenants by co-operation between the proprietor and the tenant?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",198
"199","â€”Yes, it could.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",199
"200","41664. So you think a poorer proprietor might in a less satisfactory manner get the thing done still cheaper?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",200
"201","â€”Yes, he could, by the proprietor contributing a certain amount of assistance and the tenant doing the labour and perhaps contributing a sum towards the expense of the house.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",201
"202","41665. Are most of these smaller holdings separated by fencing from each other?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",202
"203","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",203
"204","41666. Are the fields in them separate from one another?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",204
"205","â€”Yes, in the most of them. In the very small holdings paying from Â£4 to Â£7 there are only boundary fences made by the proprietor, and they make the subdivision fences themselves. They get wood, and make the subdivisions themselves.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",205
"206","41667. It is done with wooden fences?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",206
"207","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",207
"208","41668. Posts and rails?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",208
"209","â€”Posts and wire.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",209
"210","41669. From Sir Alexander's own woods?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",210
"211","â€”Yes, the posts are given free.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",211
"212","41670. Have you any idea what the aggregate expense has been upon that east country farm entailed by this process of conversion?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",212
"213","â€”No, I could not mention the figures.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",213
"214","41671. What became of the old farm steading?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",214
"215","â€”It is now still occupied on one of the farms.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",215
"216","41672. On one of the larger subdivisions?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",216
"217","â€”Yes, the one that pays Â£400. There is one still paying Â£400.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",217
"218","41673. It is the farm house of the Â£400 lot?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",218
"219","â€”Yea",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",219
"220","41674. Except with reference to the return for the money laid out, this social experiment has been a satisfactory one?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",220
"221","â€”Very satisfactory, and the admiration of every one who goes to see it. There you find an example, if circumstances would permit, of what a Highland property not highly situated could be converted into.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",221
"222","41675. I would like to know what amount of capital, so to speak, on this east coast farm Sir Alexander Matheson has sacrificed for the good of his people?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",222
"223","â€”I will send a statement of that to the Commission.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",223
"224","41676. On this particular farm?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",224
"225","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",225
"226","41677. At any rate, socially speaking, it has been a perfect success?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",226
"227","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",227
"228","41678. Where did you get the small tenants from; were they taken from overcrowded townships on the same property, or were they collected all around the country?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",228
"229","â€”I may mention that the population was under 130 when he got the estate. He picked out a few.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",229
"230","41679. I think you said 130 for the valley?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",230
"231","â€”That valley includes all his large farm, and there were no other occupants on the large farm except in this valley.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",231
"232","41680. But I said on the estate. Did Sir Alexander pick out the tenants for' this place from townships elsewhere on his own estate that were overcrowded, or did he just take them from the general mass?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",232
"233","â€”A few from his own estate, because the crofters who were there at the time he bought the property outside this farm are there themselves still, or their descendants, and then he had to introduce picked men from other places. They were all picked, and that is what made it so successful.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",233
"234","41681. Was this transaction in some degree instrumental towards the consolidation of small holdings on other parts of the estate?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",234
"235","â€”No, the smaller holdings were first made for labourers, and for people who were not in very good circumstances, to make them more comfortable, and then in 1858 he tried the first experiment of a club farm. Till 1858 part of the grazing of this large farm was in his own hand, and in 1858 he broke it up into a club farm occupied by six tenants. That was his first experiment in club farms, and finding it so successful, though they were picked men and knew their work, he extended it to other parts of the property. ",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",235
"236","41682. My object was to ascertain whether the transaction of cutting up this large farm had been instrumental in reducing the number of small holdings on the estate?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",236
"237","â€”No.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",237
"238","41683. Now, transport yourself for a moment to the west country farm. The same process has been going on on the Loch Carron farm. Speaking generally, has it been equally successful and equally satisfactory?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",238
"239","â€”No.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",239
"240","41684. Not quite?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",240
"241","â€”No, not equally satisfactory.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",241
"242","41685. But has it been tolerably satisfactory?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",242
"243","â€”Yes, it has. The reason is that there are no people introduced there but the natives, and it is so difficult to stir them up to see what is for their own benefit. They will not take very good care of what the proprietor makes for them, but allow it in many cases to go wrong; and then when things go wrong, they call again upon the proprietor to rectify what they allowed to go wrong.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",243
"244","41686. The people have proved less skilful and more thriftless upon the west coast farm?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",244
"245","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",245
"246","41687. But with regard to the sacrifice of capital in proportion to the value of the farm, has the sacrifice of capital for a benevolent purpose been proportionally greater on the west coast farm than on the east coast?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",246
"247","â€”Yes, fully a third greater.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",247
"248","41688. But perhaps the subject may have been less promising. The farm may have been less happily situated?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",248
"249","â€”Such is the case, but I consider that in saying a third.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",249
"250","41689. Then you say that a benevolent proprietor must be expected to sacrifice one-third more on the west coast than on the east coast?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",250
"251","â€”Yes, that is what I mean.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",251
"252","41690. Mr Cameron.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",252
"253","â€”It is stated here that the average expenditure on the larger holdings on the west coast was Â£176 odds?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",253
"254","â€”An average of Â£114.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",254
"255","41691. Â£114 on the crofts, but the average amount of money upon each was Â£176. What is the average rent of these crofts?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",255
"256","â€”Â£30.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",256
"257","41692. Are these the larger crofts?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",257
"258","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",258
"259","41693. What I want to arrive at is, what the rental of these crofts now is, and what the interest on Â£176, the average sum expended on them, would amount to?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",259
"260","â€”The rental is now Â£1108.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",260
"261","41694. Then it is about 10s. each?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",261
"262","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",262
"263","41695. Then the interest of the money spent upon the crofts at 5 per cent, would be about Â£9?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",263
"264","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",264
"265","41696. And the average rent is Â£10?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",265
"266","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",266
"267","41697. So that only leaves Â£ 1 for the land as it was?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",267
"268","â€”Yes, and he was getting Â£931.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",268
"269","41698. I don't care what he was getting. I am looking to the future, as an experiment, how it is likely to answer. In what state was this land before it was improved? Was it worth more than Â£1 for the whole holding?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",269
"270","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",270
"271","41699. It was not all waste land?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",271
"272","â€”No, it was not all waste land. Before he expended the money the rental was about Â£9, barely Â£9, and",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",272
"273","now it is Â£10, so there is only Â£1 of increase.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",273
"274","41700. So he gets about Â£1 more than the interest of the money he expended on it?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",274
"275","â€”Yes, leaving Â£1 to meet the old rent.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",275
"276","41701. You have described the process of building the houses; will you tell ms what were the other improvements which Sir Alexander effected upon these west coast crofts?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",276
"277","â€”It was not on the west coast crofts that he erected the buildings; it was on the east coast.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",277
"278","41702. Then what did he do about the houses on the west coast crofts?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",278
"279","â€”He got the houses when the property was bought. The houses were there, except a few new ones that he built. In Loch Carron he built over a dozen new houses, and got that place organised.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",279
"280","41703. And how was the Â£20,116 expended upon the larger crofts?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",280
"281","â€”In improving lands and building houses for about a dozen of them.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",281
"282","41704. It was in improvements effected upon existing crofts?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",282
"283","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",283
"284","41705. And no land was taken from larger farms in that case?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",284
"285","â€”No.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",285
"286","41706. Did the improvement consist in draining?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",286
"287","â€”Draining, trenching, ploughing, and fencing.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",287
"288","41707. Has Sir Alexander done anything on the west coast in the way of taking land from large farms and giving it to crofters?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",288
"289","â€”Yes, there is one large farm he broke up.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",289
"290","41708. Which is that?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",290
"291","â€”Sallachy. It was mentioned in my previous evidence.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",291
"292","41709. The Chairman.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",292
"293","â€”The rent of this large farm on the east coast was Â£900, and now it is a very little more, not representing any material interest whatever on the outlay in improvement. But supposing this large farm which was then rented for Â£900 had been kept in its aggregate, undivided form, what do you think it would have let for at this moment? Under present circumstances, would there have been a decline in its rental or not?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",293
"294","â€”No, I think the rent would be about the same, for sheep farms increased in value within the period since he bought the property, and now they are falling back again.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",294
"295","41710. You don't think they have fallen back to a greater degree than the amount of rental at the time the experiment began?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",295
"296","â€”No, I think they are about the same.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",296
"297","41711. But in that case Sir Alexander sacrificed the rental of the farm which in the years of inflation he might have obtained?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",297
"298","â€”Yes.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",298
"299","41712. Would that have been very considerable?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",299
"300","â€”About one-fifth more.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",300
"301","41713. Sheriff Nicolson.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",301
"302","â€”As the result of your observation and experience, do you think there is a decided difference in the character and habits of the west coast and east coast people of the county of Ross?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",302
"303","â€”I do.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",303
"304","41714. Have you any definite information or theory on the subject?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",304
"305","â€”Yes; there are two reasons. One is that they are quite a distinct race.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",305
"306","41715. In what respect?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",306
"307","â€”They have not the same intermixture of Scandinavian and Saxon blood on the west coast as on the east coast.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",307
"308","41716. You think they are more Celtic on the west coast?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",308
"309","â€”Yes. Another reason, and the principal one, is that they are kept so much to themselves, â€”they do not mix up with people on the east coast to gather information. They do not associate except among themselves, and consequently they cannot acquire so much knowledge.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",309
"310","41717. Is there also a considerable difference in the soil and climate?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",310
"311","â€”A great deal.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",311
"312","41718. The climate is warmer on the west coast?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",312
"313","â€”Yes, and creates more lassitude, and consequently they cannot work so well. There is not so much animation about them.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",313
"314","41719. In that respect do you know of any particular difference of character between the West Ross-shire people and the Islanders?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",314
"315","â€”I am not acquainted there.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",315
"316","41720. The same complaint is made against them, and yet there is undoubtedly a very large Scandinavian element in those Western Islands?",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",316
"317","â€”Well, I am not acquainted with them. I was only once in the Lewis.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",317
"318","[The witness subsequently put in the following supplement with reference to the farm at Ardross which, when Sir Alexander Matheson purchased the estate in 1845, was occupied by one tenant at a rent of Â£935, and now occupied by thirty tenants :",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",318
"319","â€”The expenditure by Sir Alexander in improving the lands and erecting buildings for the tenant is Â£21,753, and his rental from the thirty tenants is Â£1250 / 18 / 6",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",319
"320","Deduct the original rent of . . . Â£935 / 0 / 0",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",320
"321","Less the value of grazing rent of Dibidale forest, 200 / 0 / 0",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",321
"322","= Â£ 735 / 0 / 0",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",322
"323","TOTALs Â£525 /18/ 6",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",323
"324","equal to Â£2, 9s. 2d. per cent, on the outlay. Sir Alexander further expended Â£6176 on making a road to Dibidale forest and on erecting a lodge there. The rent he gets for Dibidale forest is Â£1000, or Â£800 more than the grazing value, which makes the increase of rent over the whole Â£1325, 18s. 6d., equal to Â£4, 0s. 10d, per cent, on the outlay.",690,"Roderick Maclean","Inverness, ",324
