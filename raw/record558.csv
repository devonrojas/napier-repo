"1","DONALD M'DONALD, sen., Cottar, Polnish (nearly 80)—examined.",558,"Donald Mcdonald senior","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",1
"2","33396. The Chairman.",558,"Donald Mcdonald senior","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",2
"3","—What statement have you to make?",558,"Donald Mcdonald senior","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",3
"4","—' Polnish is not a crofter, but only a cottar, township of three householders, whose fathers had land in the place. Two of us pay 30s. a year and one pays £ 2 of rent for mere shells of black houses which we thatch ourselyes; and for a cow's grass apiece we pay £ 3 to the tacksman. At first we had of land what enabled us to winter the cows and grow some potatoes. Some of this land was near our houses, where we could look after it, but another portion is about a mile away. But the tacksman took the near portion from us and only left us the distant piece; but since the deer have come in we have lost the use of it entirely. For a time we were able to guard it from the sheep; but the deer come by night, and the last time we attempted to grow potatoes, they were of no use. So we have had to give up grass and potato ground, as no fence has been erected to protect the ground from the sheep and deer. We were promised a fence by the late Mr Astley and by MrM'Kenzie, factor, and on the strength of these promises we planted potatoes; but they were destroyed, and our husbandry entirely stopped. The result is that from being poor we have become poorer, and our case is truly pitiable. We are a sad example of the ruinous effects of the growth of deer forests—especially where they are not fenced. Our demands are not great. We would be thankful for as much land as would afford us summering and wintering for a cow, and land in which we could plant a few potatoes; and we wish to be protected from the deer above all things. Sheep were bad enough, but the deer have nearly finished us.",558,"Donald Mcdonald senior","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",4

"46","33415. Were you better pleased to pay 6d. for the house as it was before, or 30s. as it is now?",558,"Donald Mcdonald senior","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",46
