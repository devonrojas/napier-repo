"3","â€”Who appoints you as constable?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",3
"4","â€”The ground officer.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",4

"6","â€”To keep the affairs of the township in order.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",6
"7","15114. Your duties are not those of an ordinary policeman ?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",7
"8","â€”No.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",8
"9","15115. Then what otherwise do you do to keep things in order?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",9
"10","â€”When people quarrel or disagree they require to be looked after, and that is part of my work. If they differ about marches or anything of that sort, it falls within my duty.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",10
"11","15116. Are you left to dispose of those matters yourself, or do you act under authority from the ground officer ?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",11
"12","â€”If we are able to settle the matter among ourselves, well and good ; if not, we must go to the ground officer to have it settled.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",12
"13","15117. And if anybody is not satisfied with the law which you administer among them, to whom do they appeal ?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",13
"14","â€”To the ground officer, if the matter affects land or anything of that kind.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",14

"20","â€”I believe they do sometime appeal to the factor also.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",20
"21","15121. Do they ever get your judgments reversed, or those of the ground officer?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",21
"22","â€”Sometimes. My decision is now and again reversed by the ground officer, but, so far as I have been able to gather, the practice of the factor, when an appeal is made to him against the ground officer, is to remit it back to him for further consideration.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",22
"23","15122. I believe the people think the ground officer is really the most important man for them to have to do with. Is that so ?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",23
"24","â€”They consider the factor the superior man.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",24
"25","15123. But I suppose, if a man had the judgment of the ground officer against him. he would not have much hope of getting it changed by the factor ?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",25
"26","â€”I doubt whether he would.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",26

"42","â€”The previous witness has brought forward the affairs of both the towns, North and South.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",42
"43","15132. Have you no different complaints in North Shawbost from what they have in South Shawbost ?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",43
"44","â€”I do not say that the grievances of the two towns are exactly the same, but there is one special matter which affects the whole town that has not been brought forward. I am not sure the practice prevaded in the other portion of the township, but it prevailed in ours, that a certain amount of money was accepted from a man when he was being settled in a croft of new. He paid Â£ 5 before he got it.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",44

"157","â€”There was once a sort of quay, but the sea washed it away.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",157
"158","15189. Would they be the better of a similar quay?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",158
"159","â€”It was not much worth, and it was in a bad place. If a new quay was built, it would be built in a different place.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",159

"165","15192. Have you ever heard that they did?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",165
"166","â€”I hear things, but I cannot say what they are unless I am certain.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",166
"167","15193. Did you hear that the total expense of the reclamation that was made was paid by the tenants ultimately over and above what they paid in regular rent? ",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",167
"168","â€”I never heard that. The reclaimed land is of two classes. The greater portion of it was done either at the expense of the proprietor or the Government. There are others again here who have reclaimed a bit of land at their own expense. ",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",168

"175","15197. Did you hear it was paid back?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",175
"176","â€”No. I know that the little I got myself when I was building my house I never paid back.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",176
"177","15198. About the Â£5 which you say you heard was paid by two men, did they get any equivalent for the Â£5 ?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",177
"178","â€”One of them told me he never got a penny.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",178
"179","15199. Did he not receive buildings, or did he pay anything to the outgoing man for the timber or otherwise ?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",179
"180","â€”One of the men is my own next door neighbour. He came in upon the place of a man who had run into arrears. He built a new house himself upon that place, and the former tenant is there still, sitting in the old house on the same property. I don't know whether he had made any arrangement with that tenant.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",180

"186","â€”I don't think he is.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",186
"187","15203. What is his name?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",187
"188","â€”Kenneth Macrae.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",188
"189","15204. Was there a rumour through Shawbost that some time ago the former ground officer was in the habit of exacting those sums on his own account without the knowledge of his superiors ?",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",189
"190","â€”It was the ground officer that actually imposed this sum of money upon that man, but he himself says it was for the factor. [Question repeated.] I used to hear a rumour of that kind, but I cannot say for certain that there was any foundation for it.",269,"Donald Mcleod","Lewis, Barvas ",190
