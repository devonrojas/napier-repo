"1","ANGUS MACDONALD, Crofter, Island of Boreray (57)—examined.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",1
"2","12544. The Chairman.—Were you freely elected a delegate?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",2
"3","—Yes.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",3
"4","12545. Have you got a statement to make to us?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",4
"5","—Yes.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",5
"6","—' Island of Boreray, North Uist, 29th May 1883. To the Right Hon. Lord Napier, Chairman of the Royal Commission Highlands and Islands.—Sir, The following are a few of the grievances of which we complain, viz., the smallness and dearness of our holdings, the overcrowding of the people, and the unproductiveness of the soiL The island on which we live is not a square mile in extent, including a brackish loch covering more than 30 acres of land. The population is about 150. The most of the arable land is ploughed every year for the last one hundred, which renders it so light that in spring the winds generally carry away the corn seed. There",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",6
"7","are twenty horses working the arable land. Each crofter sows on an average five bushels of barley, and even in a productive year they only grind ten bushels. The cattle are almost starving in the winter for want of fodder, which leaves them in a wretched condition during the whole year. In former years we used to pay our rent by draining the fore-mentioned loch and securing and sloping sandbanks, but since the present proprietor bought the island no such work exists. We generally pay our rent now by cash and some kelp. We have to carry our peats eight or nine miles by sea from the factor's ground for which we pay. We are paying school rates for the last ten or eleven years, and as yet the school board has not taken any steps to build a schoolhouse for us. The Ladies' Association kindly supply us with a teacher. The appointed delegates will answer any question which your Lordship may deem desirable to ask them.—We are your Lordship's humble servants, Crofters of the Island of Boreray, per ANGUS MACDONALD.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",7
"8","12546. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—Were you born in the island of Boreray ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",8
"9","—Yes. ",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",9
"10","12547. How many people were there in your younger days ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",10
"11","—Twenty crofters.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",11
"12","12548. Were there cottars also ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",12
"13","—Yes, eight cottars as well.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",13
"14","12549. Has the population increased very considerably since your time ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",14
"15","—Yes, it has considerably increased. There are 150 now, including cottars.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",15
"16","12550. And, I suppose, as the island is limited in extent, this increase of population presses upon you? —Yes. There are twenty crofters just now and eight, cottar families. The eight cottar families have thirty-two people among them ; the rest are made up of the crofter families.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",16
"17","12551. You stated here that you used to pay your rent by draining the fore-mentioned loch and securing and sloping sandbanks, but since the present proprietor bought the island no such work exists. Why did the proprietor give up that work ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",17
"18","—I do not know why the present proprietor ceased.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",18
"19","12552. Did he carry it on at all from the time of getting the property ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",19
"20","—I am not aware he did any work of that kind.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",20
"21","12553. Could the sea be stopped from getting into the place ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",21
"22","—It would not be very easy. It enters it every spring tide of the year.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",22
"23","12554. But is it possible to do it ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",23
"24","—The former proprietors were keeping it out before the present proprietor.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",24
"25","12555. Have you got any reduction of rent in consequence of losing the value of this loch to a great extent? —No, the rent has been left as it was with the former proprietors. There has been no change during the present proprietor's time, only there are now taxes which make the rent higher.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",25
"26","12556. It seems incredible that the poor people are obliged to bring their peats eight or nine miles by sea from the factor's ground. How long have they been obliged to carry them all that distance ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",26
"27","—They have been taking them from the same place ever since I remember.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",27
"28","12557. Then I presume you want a great number of the surplus population to be removed from the island ? Is that the only way to put them right ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",28
"29","—The cottars upon the island would require it all for themselves, ",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",29
"30","to put them in proper condition.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",30
"31","12558. Did you ever represent your very serious condition to the proprietor or the factor ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",31
"32","—No.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",32
"33","12559. Why did you not do it ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",33
"34","—The factor is very kind to us.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",34
"35","12560. That was all the more reason you should do so?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",35
"36","—We did not know where he could send us.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",36
"37","12561. You have been here all day?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",37
"38","—Yes,",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",38
"39","12562. Did you hear some of the previous delegates say that there was plenty of land in Uist ",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",39
"40","—Yes.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",40
"41","12563. Do you approve of that?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",41
"42","—Yes, to provide for all the people, if only they got it.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",42
"43","12564. Where did the people come from originally1? Has the island been inhabited from time immemorial by a certain number of people ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",43
"44","—The proprietor of Boreray held it once.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",44
"45","12565. And there were no people on it then?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",45
"46","—Only himself and his servant.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",46
"47","12566. Who was he?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",47
"48","—John M'Lean, laird of Boreray.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",48
"49","12567. What time was this?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",49
"50","—Was it one hundred years ago or so?—I think it is short of one hundred years, but I do not remember the time within a large number of years.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",50
"51","12568. When it fell into Lord Macdonald's hands, was it then that the people began to settle in it ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",51
"52","—Lord Macdonald never had it. It was not part of the estate of North Uist at all. The M'Leans possessed it all along. My father was alive when tenants were sent to Boreray.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",52
"53","12569. From where ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",53
"54","—Some portions of it were given to his own servants, and others came by his orders from other places. One came from Bernera, and others from adjacent places in the sound of North Uist.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",54
"55","12570. Are you much in arrear with your rent ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",55
"56","—I am not aware that we were ever so much in arrear as this year, siuce the present proprietor got the property.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",56
"57","12571. Are the people generally very poor?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",57
"58","—The greater number of them are very poor indeed.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",58
"59","12572. Do you derive no benefit from the board schools ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",59
"60","—There is no board school, but there is a Ladies' Committee in Edinburgh that supplies us with a school.  That is the Free Church Ladies' Association.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",60
"61","12573. In point of fact, you are paying school rates, and have positively no school accommodation ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",61
"62","—That is the case. We pay school rates, and get no return for them.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",62
"63","12574. How far is Boreray from the mainland ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",63
"64","—The ferry is three miles broad.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",64
"65","12575. Sheriff Nicolson.—Have you made representations to the school board about getting a board school ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",65
"66","—We never made any such representation,",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",66
"67","12576. How many children are there generally attending the Ladies' Association School ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",67
"68","—There are about thirty children of school age, but I cannot exactly say what the attendance is.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",68
"69","12577. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—How long would it take you to reach the nearest board school ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",69
"70","—It would not take them very long if they could walk it ; but the ferry is three miles.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",70
"71","12578. Are the children brought in at the inspection of the nearest board school ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",71
"72","—No, but Miss Rainy of Edinburgh comes every second year to examine the school.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",72
"73","12579. Do your children pay fees at the Ladies' school ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",73
"74","—No ; the only fee is to provide the schoolmaster with peats, and that is not very easy for those who have no boats to ferry the peats. It is not easy for them to do their share of that work.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",74
"75","12580. How do those who have no boats manage to get peats for themselves ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",75
"76","—They pay the others for ferrying the peats across.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",76
"77","12581. Are there no peats nearer than nine miles from them ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",77

"84","—Yes, there was such an arrangement once upon a time.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",84
"85","12585. Was that to keep the sea out?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",85
"86","—Yes",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",86
"87","12586. And then to let the fresh water out at low water ?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",87
"88","—Yes; when there was one to look after it, the sluice raised at low water to let out the fresh water of the loch.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",88
"89","12587. And that increased the amount of cultivable land?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",89
"90","—Yes; we remember the time when places that are never dry now were cultivated. ",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",90
"91","12588. Do you still pay the same rent?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",91

"96","—No. ",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",96

"98","—I cannot tell that.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",98
"99","12592. Were they paying as much as the rent you were paying?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",99
"100","—I do not think they were, in draining the loch.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",100
"101","12593. Did the people generally make their rent by their work?",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",101
"102","—With the addition of kelp, they were able to pay their rent—by these works and kelp in addition. The cultivatable ground is just now as white as if it were covered with snow by the drift of the sand. About Whitsunday it is peculiarly bad, and it is not oats that grow there but weeds, that are not good for fodder or anything else.",220,"Angus Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",102
