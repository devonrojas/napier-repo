"10","4006. Who was your predecessor?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",10
"11","—Peter M'Lean. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",11

"19","—Yes, because he paid the same sum before me. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",19
"20","4011. For what did you pay that £8?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",20
"21","—It was after I took it that I understood the matter; but so far as I understand, from what I heard, the money did not go to the proprietor. I think the original beginning of it was about a house that was on the farm. It was the value of the old house. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",21
"22","4012. But you gave it to your predecessor1?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",22
"23","—Yes. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",23

"28","—Are you entitled to get that £8 when you leave again ?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",28
"29","—Well, it depends on circumstances. I cannot guarantee that, but (to show the scarcity of land) I was almost forced to do it. It was no necessity, but my own free will. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",29
"30","4015. Why did Peter M'Lean, your predecessor, leave?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",30
"31","—I understood he got a better place. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",31
"32","4016. He left it of his own free will?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",32
"33","—Yes, and I counted it as an obligement that I got it. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",33
"34","4017. Did you agree with the factor for the place before you agreed with Peter M'Lean ?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",34
"35","—So far as I understood the rules, he could not give it to me without the consent of the factor. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",35
"36","4018. But he got it?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",36
"37","—Yes. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",37
"38","4019. Did the factor know you paid him £8?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",38
"39","—I cannot say, because M'Lean had to do with the factor, and I had to do with M'Lean. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",39
"40","4020. Do you think the factor, up to this moment, ever knew about the £81",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",40
"41","— I think he knows it. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",41
"42","4021. Did you ever mention it to him?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",42
"43","—No, because I never had the opportunity. We live a distance apart from one another. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",43
"44","4022. But you pay rent to him sometimes ?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",44
"45","—Not yet. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",45
"46","4023. Does the house still stand for which this £ 8 was originally given ?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",46
"47","—No, the house has fallen; I cannot tell how long since. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",47
"48","4024. And you don't know how many generations the £ 8 has gone on for?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",48
"49","—No. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",49
"50","4025. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",50
"51","—Are there any such cases as your own in the same town ?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",51
"52","—I don't think it; so far as I know, I understand it was not as arrears, but for the price of the house, and M'Lean had to pay the same as I had. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",52
"53","4026. But it was for a house that you did not get the benefit of ?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",53
"54","—-That is the sum and substance of the whole. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",54
"55","4027. The Chairman.",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",55
"56","—Had M'Lean any arrears of rent at the moment he left ?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",56
"57","—M'Lean had it only a year. I do not think he was in arrears. ",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",57
"58","4028. Mr Cameron.",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",58
"59","—He is a substantial man ?",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",59
"60","—Yes",66,"Alexander Mcinnes","Skye, Dunvegan",60
