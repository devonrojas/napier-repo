"1","ALEXANDER BUCHANAN, Surgeon, Tyree (46) —examined.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",1
"2","33692. Professor Mackinnon.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",2
"3","—How long have you been in the parish?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",3
"4","—Twenty-three years.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",4
"5","33693. I suppose you have charge of the neighbouring parish of Coll?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",5
"6","—I had for twenty years, but I gave it up two years ago.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",6
"7","33691. You know it almost as well as Tyree ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",7
"8","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",8
"9","33695. And I suppose you may state that your interest in the place is not that of medical officer entirely, but your relatives are connected with the district ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",9
"10","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",10
"11","33696. And have been for a long time back ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",11
"12","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",12
"13","33697. You have been continuously in Tyree for the last twenty-three years ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",13
"14","—I have.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",14
"15","33698. And you know the condition of the people thoroughly well?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",15
"16","—Pretty well.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",16
"17","33699. You have heard the evidence that they gave here to-day ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",17
"18","—I have since you resumed after lunch.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",18
"19","33700. The outcome of it is that perhaps some time before you came to the place, and also since you came to the place, there has been a good deal of consolidation of small crofts into big farms, that there has been a raising of the rents, and that there is a large number of people in the island without land at all ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",19
"20","—Not since I came. There have been only two farms cleared since I came —Scaranish and another.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",20
"21","33701. The tradition of clearances was quite fresh when you came?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",21
"22","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",22
"23","33702. So that the evidence led in that respect was quite true ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",23
"24","—Quite true.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",24
"25","33703. Would you like to say whether you know that the rents have been increased?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",25
"26","—They have not been much increased since I came, except in some isolated cases. ",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",26
"27","33704. But before you came there was an increase?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",27
"28","—There was an increase before I came.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",28
"29","33705. And you are quite aware that there is a large number of people in the island without any land ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",29
"30","—I am.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",30
"31","33706. What is the condition of this cottar class that are without any land at all, are they very poorly off ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",31
"32","—A great number of them are poorly off, and some are as well off as the crofter class.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",32
"33","33707. I suppose those who have strong young families are well off?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",33
"34","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",34
"35","33708. And those who have no strong men are just not so well off ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",35
"36","—They are badly off.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",36
"37","33709. What is the general condition of those of the crofter class whose rents are £12 to £15 ; are they in such circumstances that they are able to carry on from year to year, and perhaps stand a bad year ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",37
"38","—The crofters who pay £15 are not so well off as those paying above that sum; but where they have families in the south they support them, and some of them are pretty well off. Of course, their crofts are not able to pay their rents as well as crofts say of £25 or £30.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",38
"39","33710. As rents go in the place, what kind of croft—what rent —do you think would be the minimum upon which a crofter could live fairly just now ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",39
"40","—£20.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",40
"41","33711. And what would be about the size of that croft?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",41
"42","—Say about thirty-two acres or so.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",42
"43","33712. And what would his stock be?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",43
"44","—Two horses, eight to ten cows, and some sheep.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",44
"45","33713. They complain that they have no sheep, and that the outrun was taken from them ; do you think that is a reasonable grievance?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",45
"46","—No ; because they would quarrel among themselves with sheep in their outruns. That has been the case as far as I can see.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",46
"47","33714. Do the cottar class live mainly by fishing?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",47
"48","—A number do; but a number have families in the south, at sea, or working as agricultural labourers, and they send them home money from the south to support their parents. There is a good many of that class in the island.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",48
"49","33715. Are there many able to make a living by fishing off the shore ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",49
"50","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",50
"51","33716. And do you think, if they had good shelter for their boats, as the last witness spoke of, a greater number would be able to make their living ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",51
"52","—Certainly, and they would have larger boats.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",52
"53","33717. That is very much required ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",53
"54","—It is.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",54
"55","33718. I suppose as boatmen at home and sailors away there is not the beat of them ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",55
"56","—-They are really very good.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",56
"57","33719. They are strong men ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",57
"58","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",58
"59","33720. I suppose with respect to their physical condition you would say they are very strong men ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",59
"60","—They compare favourably with any of the other islands as regards physical condition.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",60
"61","33721. And healthy ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",61
"62","—Yes, averagely healthy.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",62
"63","33722. Do you draw any distinction between the crofter and cottar class in respect of their physical condition?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",63
"64","—Yes, I do as to the children The cottar class children appear to be in want of milk a good deal as compared with the crofter class.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",64
"65","33723. And I suppose that would tell in the future?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",65
"66","—Of course.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",66
"67","33724. There are a large number of them whose crofts are less than £20, and they would all wish to make them of reasonable size; is there sufficient land in the place to supply those people with land, and still not break down large farms ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",67
"68","—There is not; but if they had a large outrun for cattle, they could cultivate their crofts.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",68
"69","33725. And is there such a large outrun in the place ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",69
"70","—There is not a large outrun vacant, as far as I am aware.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",70
"71","33726. What would be your own opinion with respect to the amount of the estate under large tracts and the amount under a large population of crofters—whether there is really too much of it under the large tacks ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",71
"72","—According to the population, there is at present.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",72
"73","33727. The farms are not so very large in this district as they are in others; what is about the rent of the biggest farm in the place ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",73
"74","—About £400.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",74
"75","33728. What is the rent of the smallest of the large farms ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",75
"76","—I suppose about £98 or £100.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",76
"77","33729. And are there crofts at £30, £40, and £50 ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",77
"78","—There are some crofts of £40 and £50.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",78
"79","33730. So that in that respect there is a fair gradation ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",79
"80","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",80
"81","33731. So that a large portion of the surface is under farms, under and over £100 rent?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",81
"82","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",82
"83","33732. Do you think that if the people would get increased crofts in the event of a farm being out of lease, or the like of that, there are many in the place who could take a croft ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",83
"84","—There are a few, but a large number would not be able to take them, —that is, without outside assistance. ",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",84
"85","33733. You speak about the present population of the place; of course you know that the place is not peopled to such an extent as it was forty or fifty years ago ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",85
"86","—-No; there was then a population of something like 5000.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",86
"87","33734. Do you think it is still, considering its capacity, sufficiently peopled ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",87
"88","—There is sufficient population for the land.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",88
"89","33735. Rather too much population than too little?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",89
"90","—Rather, to make a living.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",90
"91","33736. Even supposing that the land was more evenly distributed among them than it is now, would that still be the case ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",91
"92","—It would be still the same.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",92
"93","33737. Has there been much emigration from the island since you came to it?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",93
"94","—Not much emigration to foreign parts.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",94
"95","33738. There was a great deal before you came?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",95
"96","—A great deal.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",96
"97","33739. And you have yourself been abroad?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",97
"98","—I have.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",98
"99","33740. Have you seen any of those people when you were abroad ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",99
"100","—I saw one or two who had gone, but they had only newly gone.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",100
"101","33741. Have you heard often of the condition of those who emigrated long ago from relatives at home ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",101
"102","—I have.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",102
"103","33742. What is their general condition ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",103
"104","—Their condition is that they would not return, although they would get their land back again for nothing.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",104
"105","33743. You are quite convinced that those who went are better off than those who remained ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",105
"106","—I am.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",106
"107","33744. Those who remained were not much improved in their condition by their neighbours going away?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",107
"108","—No; in fact, there was no improvement",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",108
"109","33745. It was rather the other way they say ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",109
"110","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",110
"111","33746. Are you a member of the School Board ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",111
"112","—I am.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",112
"113","33747. And have you been since the commencement?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",113
"114","—I have been since the passing of the Act.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",114
"115","33748. How is the Education Act administered in this island?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",115
"116","—Fairly.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",116
"117","33749. Any complaints about children not going to school ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",117
"118","—There is difficulty in getting them to go at certain times of the year. ",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",118
"119","33750. Are there a sufficient number of schools in the island for all the children in the place ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",119
"120","—There is.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",120
"121","33751. Good schools?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",121
"122","—Yes, but there is one township complaining a little—at least there was a complaint—it was a Free Church school, and they wanted a board school, and there were some complaints, but the place was well enough supplied at the time, and we did not think it desirable to erect a board school in the meanwhile.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",122
"123","33752. We heard elsewhere that although children were perhaps taught more regularly now, and although a greater number got the elements of education, there were formerly better scholars ; what have you to say to",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",123
"124","that in Tyree ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",124
"125","—Tyree was well off as regards education before, because the Free Church sent students here regularly ; and they sent good men. And we have been so far fortunate in getting some good teachers since the passing of the Act, and I do not see much change.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",125
"126","33753. Are you able still out of the island to send young men to college ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",126
"127","—We are.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",127
"128","33754. And do they take a good place after they go?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",128
"129","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",129
"130","33755. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",130
"131","—Has there been much poverty or distress this last winter in the island ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",131
"132","—No.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",132
"133","33756. Did the potato crop fail?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",133
"134","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",134
"135","33757. And notwithstanding that the people were able to find subsistence?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",135
"136","—Yes, they were able. Their friends assisted them from the south, and their families did not come home this year as they used to do. Some of them come home that have been serving in the south as agricultural labourers, but last year they did not come, and so were able to send more home.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",136
"137","33758. Is it common, except when they are in good circumstances, to come home at the end of the year?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",137
"138","—Yes, a number come in the winter time.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",138
"139","33759. And they remain away all winter when they are pushed ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",139
"140","—Yes, a greater number remain now than when I came here first.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",140
"141","33760. Do you think those who get into the habit of remaining away all winter will absent themselves altogether when their parents die?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",141
"142","—They will.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",142
"143","33761. And in that way there will be a natural decrease of the population?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",143
"144","—There will.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",144
"145","33762. I observe in the report of Sir John M'Neill thirty years ago, it is stated by a number of people, including Independent and Established Church ministers I think, that 2000 would be a sufficient population for this island ; is that your population ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",145
"146","—It is at present 2700—I would say it would carry about 2400 or so. If there was a decrease of 300, it would be enough.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",146
"147","33763. Do you think all cottars should be removed, and that crofters should receive larger holdings ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",147
"148","—Certainly not.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",148
"149","33764. Would you give the crofters larger holdings?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",149
"150","—I would only increase the holdings of the crofters as one crofter died out —adding the one to the other.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",150
"151","33765. You would not break up the large farms ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",151
"152","—I might where there was a very large farm.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",152
"153","33766. I think there are three tenants in the island who hold arable farms altogether, worth about £600 a piece ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",153
"154","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",154
"155","33767. Are these farms which you think might be judiciously reduced in size ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",155
"156","—Some of them. Others could not very well be given to crofters, such as Hynish.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",156
"157","33768. If the people are tolerably well to do—and they look so—have they much ground for complaint, do you think ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",157
"158","—They have ground for complaint for want of a proper harbour and want of small harbours for fishing.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",158
"159","33769. That, you think, is really the principal practical grievance ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",159
"160","—I think so.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",160
"161","33770. Are those small harbours to be easily made?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",161
"162","—Not easily without a good deal of money, but they have never been tried.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",162
"163","33771. What do you call a good deal of outlay?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",163
"164","—Say for a principal harbour it would cost £8000 or £9000 to make a pier.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",164
"165","33772. But you would require subsidiary small harbours'?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",165
"166","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",166
"167","33773. And they would cost a good deal of money too ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",167
"168","—They would.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",168
"169","33774. In fact, you contemplate an outlay of not less £10,000?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",169
"170","—Not less than £16,000 or £ 17,000.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",170
"171","33775. Would that add very much to the prospects of the island?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",171
"172","—Certainly it would to the fishing and cottar class; they would get larger boats, and prosecute the fishing to a larger extent and go further out.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",172
"173","33776. There would be no direct profit from these piers ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",173
"174","—The principal harbour would pay good interest, I have no doubt, upon the produce that leaves the island.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",174
"175","33777. It would not pay 3 per cent, on an outlay of £7000 or £8000, would it ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",175
"176","—It would pay 2 per cent.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",176
"177","33778. On £7000 or £8000?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",177
"178","—-I think so.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",178
"179","33779. The Chairman.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",179
"180","—You mentioned that although there had not been many clearances or evictions, within your own recollection two farms had been cleared—did you mean two townships?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",180
"181","—Two townships.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",181
"182","33780. How long is it since these were cleared ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",182
"183","—Eighteen or nineteen years ago.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",183
"184","33781. Was that during the tenure of the present Duke?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",184
"185","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",185
"186","33782. Was there any particular reason for clearing those townships ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",186
"187","—I suppose arrears of rent, that is the only reason I heard at the time.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",187
"188","33783. That there were long arrears of rent ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",188
"189","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",189
"190","33784. We have heard a great deal in the course of our inquiry, and very different opinions, upon the question whether the fishing industry can be best prosecuted by a separate class of people or by people associated with the crofting class. What is your opinion upon that question ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",190
"191","—My opinion is that a fisherman could not prosecute his fishing successfully with a croft.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",191
"192","33785. Your opinion would be that if the fishing industry was established here upon a solid basis by the creation of convenient and safe harbours, then there might be a separation of the classes ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",192
"193","—Yes, that is my opinion.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",193
"194","33786. But you don't think that there could be a separation of the classes until these improvements were carried out ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",194
"195","—No.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",195
"196","33787. I do not wish to suggest that opinion to you —is that your own opinion ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",196
"197","—It is my own opinion, but I believe that in a township where fishermen are, they would require a small outrun for a few grazing cows to give their families milk. ",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",197
"198","33788. You think every fisherman's family should have grazing for a cow ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",198
"199","—Not every fisherman a cow, but that so many in a township should have cows, so that they would be able to get milk.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",199
"200","33789. You would have as many cows as families?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",200
"201","—No, just a few, that there should be plenty of milk in the place for their children.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",201
"202","33790. What is your idea of a fair rent per acre for arable ground in this island?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",202
"203","—Between 10s. and 12s.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",203
"204","33791. Do heads of families, apart from fishing, ever go to labour outside, or is it only the junior members ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",204
"205","—--Only the junior members. ",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",205
"206","33792. In your recollection, do you observe any decline in the physical condition of the people ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",206
"207","—No decline.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",207
"208","33793. Is the quality of the food improving ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",208
"209","—A few more of the luxuries have crept in among them. Their food has changed a good deal. Now they have tea and coffee twice a day, instead of porridge and milk.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",209
"210","33794. Is the use of baker's bread increasing ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",210
"211","—Yes, it is.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",211
"212","33795. Is the bread baked in the island ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",212
"213","—No.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",213
"214","33796. Where is it imported from?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",214
"215","—Oban, Tobermory, Bunessan, Glasgow.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",215
"216","33797. Is the consumption of bread in that way increasing ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",216
"217","—It is of late years.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",217
"218","33798. Is the consumption of wheaten flour for making wheaten scones increasing ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",218
"219","—It is ; it was only lately imported here.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",219
"220","33799. Do you consider that the substitution of wheaten flour for oats and bailey is beneficial to the people, or is it indifferent ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",220
"221","—My faith is in oats and barley as yet, because you cannot make wheaten bread into the forms that you can make oats and barley,",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",221
"222","33800. Is there any disease in this island connected with poor dietary and bad lodgings ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",222
"223","—No ; no cases of the sort, so far as I have seen. I have only seen one case of scurvy within the last ten years.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",223
"224","33801. Any remains of cutaneous disorders ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",224
"225","—Oh yes, a good many cutaneous disorders.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",225
"226","33802. Is that associated with a peculiarity in the food ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",226
"227","—Not, so far as I know ; only cases of infection, or local cases.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",227
"228","33803. Have you had any fever ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",228
"229","—Not for a long time. The last fever was typhoid, seven or eight years ago—a little of it.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",229
"230","33804. When it occurred did you find it possible to isolate the cases ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",230
"231","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",231
"232","33805. How did you do it ; did you clear the house ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",232
"233","—No, I said that no person must go near it.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",233
"234","33806. You did not place the individual cases in isolation ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",234
"235","—No, we left them in their own houses, and when it was known that it was fever all the people kept away.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",235
"236","33807. But if it was typhoid it was not infectious ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",236
"237","—Yes, it was infectious. I have found typhoid to be infectious.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",237
"238","33808. Have you had to treat typhus here at all ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",238
"239","—No, not typhus.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",239
"240","33809. When the fever occurred did you find, on the part of the Parochial Board, every desire to afford people liberal assistance ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",240
"241","—I did.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",241
"242","33810. Was any skilled nursing obtained for the people ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",242
"243","—No.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",243
"244","33811. It was not necessary ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",244
"245","—It was not necessary.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",245
"246","33812. You mentioned that the people in the last season had not returned as much as usual from the south; do you mean to say that individuals in families remained away at service for the specific purpose of assisting their parents ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",246
"247","—I do.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",247
"248","33813. In consequence of the greater distress? ",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",248
"249","—Because they heard there was a failure of the potato crop here, they did not want to come home and burden their parents.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",249
"250","33814. You said it might still be useful that there should be a slight decrease in the population of the island ; if a decrease took place, and the ground vacated by the people was added to the larger farms, would it still be useful in that form—if when people emigrated the lands they occupied were added to the larger lands ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",250
"251","—No. I would add them to the crofts.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",251
"252","33815. It would only be useful in the case of land vacated being specifically distributed amongst the crofters?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",252
"253","—That is what I mean. A crofter with forty or fifty acres is nearly as well off as a large farmer.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",253
"254","33816. Would you say, on a general review of the situation, that the management of the estate had been a liberal one, in reference, I mean, to a fair proportion of the rental having been spent in benevolent and useful",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",254
"255","work in the island ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",255
"256","—I would rather not answer that question.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",256
"257","33817. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",257
"258","—In Sir John M'Neill's report, which is now thirty years old, it was stated that the population, which was",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",258
"259","then 4000, might properly be reduced to 2000 ; but are you not aware that since that time the population has decreased very considerably ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",259
"260","—I am.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",260
"261","33818. Is it also not the fact that a great deal of the land of the remaining population has been consolidated and added to large farms?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",261
"262","—Not since I came here, twenty years ago.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",262
"263","33819. I am speaking of the date of Sir John M'Neill's report ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",263
"264","—Yes, it has been since that time, I think; but I can only speak from 1860.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",264
"265","33820. So that what Sir John M'Neill pointed to, in the matter of population being reduced, was not at all consistent with adding farm to farm, was it ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",265
"266","—I do not understand quite.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",266
"267","33821. Was not the idea that must have been prevailing in the mind of Sir John M'Neill, or those whom he consulted, when suggesting that the population should be reduced, that the reduced population should have",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",267
"268","the full benefit of the island of Tyree ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",268
"269","—That would be the sense of it, I think ; that the island would support 2000.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",269
"270","33822. Would there be any use in reducing the population to 2000, or to the 2300 you suggest, unless the lands occupied by the population to be removed were to be given to the small people ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",270
"271","—Certainly not.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",271
"272","33823. Can you instance any case within your own recollection, or have you heard, of any lands being added to the crofter class ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",272
"273","—No, not that I am aware of.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",273
"274","33824. So then any pretence of saying that emigration is good for the country would be of no value unless it benefits those that remain behind ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",274
"275","—No, certainly not.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",275
"276","33825. Supposing, for instance, that farm was to be added to large farm in the island of Tyree as people went away, you might reduce the population to twenty people ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",276
"277","—You might.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",277
"278","33826. You state with regard to the food of the people that it has altered a good deal, and that, in place of the good old porridge and milk, tea and coffee have been introduced ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",278
"279","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",279
"280","33827. Whose fault is it that that food has changed ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",280
"281","—It is no fault of the people, it is the good communication with the south—with the towns.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",281
"282","33828. In former times had not the most of the people land which was able to supply them with meal, and also cows to supply them with milk ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",282
"283","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",283
"284","33829. And therefore they took their own produce?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",284
"285","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",285
"286","33830. But then, when their lands were diminished and their cows taken away, where could they get the meal or milk ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",286
"287","—Supposing the lands were not there they gave the crop to the cows, and that got them tea and sugar and meal from the south.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",287
"288","33831. But don't you think the change is to be more attributed to the altered circumstances in which the people were placed by the deprivation of their lands than to any new-fangled idea of luxury ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",288
"289","—No, I place it all to the communication with the south.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",289
"290","33832. How is it then that people in a better position in life are very fond of taking porridge and milk?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",290
"291","—Because times have changed. Gentlemen now have taken to porridge and milk, and the poorer classes ",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",291
"292","have taken to tea and coffee. ",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",292
"293","33833. It is merely a whim of fashion you think ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",293
"294","—I think so. ",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",294
"295","33834. You were asked a question just now about the state of the island generally, and whether large sums or any sums of money had been spent in benevolent and philanthropic objects; is there anything spent directly for the benefit of the poorer people ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",295
"296","—Not much that I am aware of; there may be a few things.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",296
"297","33835. Who is the representative of the Duke of Argyle in the island ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",297
"298","—Mr M'Diarmid.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",298
"299","33836. Does everything centre in one gentleman locally ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",299
"300","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",300
"301","33837. Is there any society of any kind in the island whereby the crofter and cottar class, by coming in contact with them, might have their social position improved, and their ideas and views elevated; is there any",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",301
"302","society in Tyree ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",302
"303","—Not much.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",303
"304","33838. Are there any prizes offered for nice houses or gardens, or agricultural shows ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",304
"305","—Yes, there are; the Duke gives in the summer for agricultural shows some £20 every year.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",305
"306","33839. That you can point to as one direct act ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",306
"307","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",307
"308","33840. Are you in favour of large properties with large populations, when the proprietor does not reside amongst his people?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",308
"309","—No.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",309
"310","33811. How often has the Duke of Argyll been in Tyree ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",310
"311","—Lately, I think, he has been here every August",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",311
"312","33812. Within the last four or five years, how long does he stay ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",312
"313","—A day, or perhaps two days.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",313
"314","33843. Does he go about speaking to the people ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",314
"315","—He does.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",315
"316","33844. Can you trace any benefit in the position of the people by his appearances here ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",316
"317","—No, I see no change from his coming and going.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",317
"318","33845. What is the character of the people of Tyree generally ; is it a place where crime is comparatively unknown ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",318
"319","—Crime is unknown. The people are quiet and peaceable.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",319
"320","33816. Do you yourself find satisfaction in going out and in among them ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",320
"321","—I do ; I never get an uncivil word.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",321
"322","33817. About Coll; what population is there there now ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",322
"323","—About 700 or 800.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",323
"324","33818. Are the people there in a comfortable condition ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",324
"325","—As far as I know, they are; I hear no complaints.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",325
"326","33819. Are there any big farms upon it ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",326
"327","—Yes, large farms, say about £500 rent. There is one farm of that extent, and others down from that to £45.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",327
"328","33850. Coll was the ancient heritage of a family named M'Lean?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",328
"329","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",329
"330","33851. It was then purchased by John Lome Stewart, chamberlain for Argyle ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",330
"331","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",331
"332","33852. What did he do after he came to Coll?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",332
"333","—Commenced to improve it.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",333
"334","33853. What did he do with a lot of the people ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",334
"335","—Of course, these things were before I came here. I suppose some of them were removed, or removed themselves ; I cannot say which.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",335
"336","33854. Did he not improve a great number of people off the face of Coll ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",336
"337","—I am not aware of that.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",337
"338","33855. They were improved where ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",338
"339","—They voluntarily left. By improvement I mean he built good houses and introduced dairy farming.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",339
"340","33856. Was it for the benefit of the people that he put them out, or his own convenience and comfort ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",340
"341","—Both, I think; to make a little money and to bring Ayrshire farming perhaps into use there.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",341
"342","33857. And did the remaining people of Coll benefit by the dairy farm ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",342
"343","—Do you mean the original people ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",343
"344","33858. Yes ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",344
"345","—No, not a great many, because they did not take kindly to it at first; they preferred Highland cows. .",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",345
"346","33859. Where did Mr Lome Stewart come from ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",346
"347","—Campbelton.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",347
"348","33860. Was he a Perthshire man originally ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",348
"349","—I believe so.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",349
"350","33861. Is it his son who has the place now?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",350
"351","—Yes, and I hear no complaints.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",351
"352","33862. Is the population of Coll now much less than forty years ago ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",352
"353","—It is.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",353
"354","33863. Do you know whether any notice was given to the people of Coll that the Commission was to sit here to-day ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",354
"355","—I believe there was, but I don't know.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",355
"356","33864. What communication is there between Coll and Tobermory ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",356
"357","—The same as there is here, by sailing ship and steamers once a week.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",357
"358","33865. When we came in to-day we came into a pretty creek where there is some appearance of a quay. It looks rather old. Can you give me any idea when it was built ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",358
"359","—I don't know.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",359
"360","33866. Is it beyond the memory of man?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",360
"361","—I don't know.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",361
"362","33867. Has anything been laid out upon it?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",362
"363","—Oh, yes; it has been repaired by cement being put into the holes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",363
"364","33868. Who did that ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",364
"365","—The factor, I suppose.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",365
"366","33869. He did not put a new stone, do you think, into it ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",366
"367","—There might have been, but it would be on the top.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",367
"368","33870. Do you know that the people have been petitioning about this matter of the harbour over and over again to the Duke of Argyle without effect ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",368
"369","—I am not aware that they petitioned very often, but the place has been surveyed two or three times.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",369
"370","33871. Did they petition the House of Commons complaining that they had no proper harbour ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",370
"371","—I am not aware of that.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",371
"372","33872. Profesor Mackinnon.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",372
"373","—You stated that there was no increase in the area over which the crofters' ground extended within your time, but I suppose there have been several instances of a croft being made larger ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",373
"374","—Yes, individual crofts made larger.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",374
"375","33873. Then, with respect to Coll, I suppose there is no crofter, as we understand the term, upon the portion of Coll that constitutes Mr Stewart's estate ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",375
"376","—There may be one or two, but that is all, under £30.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",376
"377","33874. All the crofters are still upon the east end portion with which you yourself are connected ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",377
"378","—Yes.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",378
"379","33875. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",379
"380","—Who is proprietor of that part of the island ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",380
"381","—My wife is.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",381
"382","33876. What is the property called ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",382
"383","—Cornaig.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",383
"384","33877. Professor Mackinnon.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",384
"385","—How many crofters will there be on Cornaig under £30 ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",385
"386","—Twelve or fourteen.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",386
"387","33878. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",387
"388","—These are the old people ?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",388
"389","—These are people who were removed from Mr Stewart's ground.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",389
"390","33879. Did your family take them on?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",390
"391","—My father-in law did.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",391
"392","33880. What was his name?",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",392
"393","—Colin Campbell.",565,"Alexander Buchanan","Argyll, Tyree",393
