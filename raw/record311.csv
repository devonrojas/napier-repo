"3","—You expressed a wish to make a statement here to day ; will you do so ?",311,"Duncan Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",3
"4","—I have to say that there have been rights taken away from the township to which I belong which they possessed before. Thirty-four years ago our land was so much abridged that we have nothing outside the heads of our rigs, between us and the sea on the other side. We have no pasture ground at all. The little we had between us and the sea was taken away from us, and a wire fence was put up between us. I believe all through the bounds of this estate you would not see a boundary so disagreeable to look at as ours, and we are now every year obliged to keep up and pay for the cost of that wire fence.",311,"Duncan Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",4
