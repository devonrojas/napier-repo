"1","JOHN MUNRO, Teacher, Lionel (23)—examined.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",1
"2","15830. The Chairman.—How long have you been here?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",2
"3","—Two and a half years.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",3
"4","15831. What country are you a native of?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",4
"5","—Ross-shire.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",5
"6","15832. Do you possess the Gaelic language ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",6
"7","—Not sufficienty to speak it fluently. I understand it better than I can speak it.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",7
"8","15833. Do you possess it sufficiently to make it useful to you in teaching ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",8
"9","—Occasionally.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",9
"10","15834. There was a delegate here to-day who complained that the religious instruction is inefficient, and that the children learn the Shorter Catechism in the English language which they don't understand. Have you any explanation to make upon that subject?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",10
"11","—One explanation is that the children do not come punctually to school in the morning, and Scripture knowledge is taught from ten to a quarter before eleven, and by that time the children have not done dropping into school. If they came in proper time they would get their full allowance of religious knowledge.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",11
"12","15835. Is the time allowed for Scripture knowledge regulated by the School Board, or is it a Government regulation ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",12
"13","—The Government lay down a code, in which it is provided that there must be two consecutive hours of teaching without Scripture knowledge.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",13
"14","15836. Do the School Board fix and regulate the hours of teaching generally?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",14
"15","—Not that I am aware of.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",15
"16","15837. Is that entirely in your hands?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",16
"17","—Yes.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",17
"18","15838. Would it be open to the School Board to prescribe that the Scripture knowledge should be taken in the middle of the day ; for instance, at the beginning of the teaching after the recess in the middle of the day ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",18
"19","—I am not aware of that.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",19
"20","15839. Is the whole of the religious instruction given in the English language ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",20
"21","—It is.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",21
"22","15840. The children learn the Catechism in English?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",22
"23","—Yes.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",23
"24","15841. And read the Bible in English ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",24
"25","—Yes.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",25
"26","15842. Is the Catechism expounded to them in Gaelic?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",26
"27","—No; but they all understand the English language sufficiently to understand the teacher when explaining it. The teacher makes a point of using the simplest language he can, and they are quite able to understand him when he explains the Catechism or the Bible.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",27
"28","15843. When the children first come to school have they any elementary catechism which they learn preliminary to the Shorter Catechism ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",28
"29","—No, they have not in this school or in those of our district, that I am aware of.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",29
"30","15844. Consequently the youngest children begin their religious instruction by learning the Shorter Catechism?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",30
"31","—Yes, and reading the simplest parts of the Bible.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",31
"32","15845. Do some children come to school without any knowledge of English at all ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",32
"33","—Some of them do; in fact, most of them do.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",33
"34","15846. Then do you think the teaching of the Shorter Catechism is in the first instance reasonably understood by the children, or do you think it is in great measure learned by rote ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",34
"35","—I think in most cases it is learned by rote. It is only the more intelligent of the children who can understand it thoroughly—in fact, there are some of the questions that it would take more than a child to understand.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",35
"36","15847. Do you think the religious instruction here is as efficient as it would be in an English school among English-speaking children?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",36
"37","—It cannot be that, because the children have not the command of the English language so well as English-speaking children.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",37
"38","15848. Would you find it a great advantage and convenience if you possessed the Gaelic language perfectly in teaching?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",38
"39","—I don't think it would. I find when any Gaelic is used in school the children are more apt to stick to the Gaelic. They speak too much Gaelic outside for the benefit of the English teaching in the school during the day.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",39
"40","15849. Then you think the children really learn English better because there is no Gaelic ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",40
"41","—I cannot say they learn English better, but I am quite aware they learn it as well at any rate. That is my own opinion.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",41
"42","15850. Do you find the attendance of the children very irregular?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",42
"43","—Very irregular, especially this year.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",43
"44","15851. Do you think the irregulaiityls in any material degree owing to poverty or want of clothes ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",44
"45","—They make the want of clothes a great excuse, especially this spring. I find the attendance is very much below the average of the past season.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",45
"46","15852. Is the want of shoes pleaded, or is it the insufficiency of their other clothing ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",46
"47","—The insufficiency of their other clothing rather.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",47
"48","15853. Mr Cameron.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",48
"49","—You heard the chairman ask one of the former witnesses whether he was aware that the minister had stated that if the attendance of the children was good the rate might be reduced on one shilling in the pound ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",49
"50","—Yes.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",50
"51","15854. Do you go so far as to say you agree with that?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",51
"52","—I think the rates could be reduced very much by a better attendance of the children.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",52
"53","15855. Is there a compulsory officer in this parish?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",53
"54","—There is, for this district—for the two schools of Lionel and Cross.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",54
"55","15856. Does he make efforts to obtain the attendance of the children ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",55
"56","—Very strenuous efforts indeed.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",56
"57","15857. In what respects does he fail?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",57
"58","—The parents do not pay much heed to him.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",58
"59","15858. What excuses do they make ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",59
"60","—Their name is legion. Some of them during the spring-time say they require the children to stay at home to help them in tilling the ground, and the smaller ones to take care of their younger brothers and sisters. After the labour the herring fishing comes on, and after the herring fishing the taking home of the",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",60
"61","peats, and the girls require to stay at home to mind the house, and so on.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",61
"62","15859. What is the average attendance in the school here ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",62
"63","—For the past years examination it was 222; this year it will be very much below that.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",63
"64","15860. Did you obtain last year a grant for 222?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",64
"65","—Yes, I obtained a grant of £200 on 250 presented for examination. The average attendance was 222.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",65
"66","15861. What is the nominal number on the roll?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",66
"67","—Close on 300 and sometimes it goes over 300.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",67
"68","15862. What age do you find the worst age for children attending ? At what age do they offer the most excuses?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",68
"69","—There is a great difficulty in the first place to get the children who are just of age to come to schooL The parents do not appear to be willing to let them come. Then, after ten, the children are kept for working, and after thirteen they are gradually taken away altogether.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",69
"70","15863. Has this bad attendance been taken notice of by the School Board ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",70
"71","—They always take notice of it, and direct that defaulting parents should be warned. On the occasion of almost every meeting they have there are defaulting parents before them. ",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",71
"72","15864. But have they taken any steps to correct the evil?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",72
"73","—They brought some of the parents before the sheriff. ",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",73
"74","15865. What happened?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",74
"75","—They all got off except one man who was confined for two days. They have been up several times before the sheriff during the last two years. ",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",75
"76","15866. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",76
"77","—One of the delegates stated that there was no Sunday school. Have you not taken steps to keep a Sunday school for religious instruction ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",77
"78","—I opened one when I came here and kept it going till a month ago, when I had to close it for want of scholars.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",78
"79","15867. Had you any assistance in the instruction of the children in Gaelic ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",79
"80","—I had one man who kept a Gaelic class to teach the Bible and Catechism in Gaelic.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",80
"81","15868. What were the hours?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",81
"82","—From five to half-past six or seven.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",82
"83","15869. Apparently the hour which you set apart for the Catechism in the morning is not very convenient, as the children drop in from ten to eleven. Is the hour of five on the Sunday afternoon convenient ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",83
"84","—Yes, it is very convenient; it is after the parents come home from church.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",84
"85","15870. In fact, it is fixed for the very purpose of convenience ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",85
"86","—Yes.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",86
"87","15871. Can you account for the falling off in attendance so that you were ultimately obliged to close it?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",87
"88","—I think it was simply owing to the want of interest which the parents took in their children having Sabbath school instruction.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",88
"89","15872. Had you both boys and girls?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",89
"90","—Boys and girls.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",90
"91","15873. How many have you had at the highest ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",91
"92","—Sometimes 180 or 190 when I started first.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",92
"93","15874. Is there any other Sunday school in the parish connected with either of the churches ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",93
"94","—There is a Sabbath school kept in the Cross school in connection with the same church.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",94
"95","15875. Is it well attended?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",95
"96","—I don't think it is very well attended in the meantime.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",96
"97","15876. Is that the school which the delegate stated he knew nothing about ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",97
"98","—Yes.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",98
"99","15877. It is not yours ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",99
"100","—No.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",100
"101","15878. Mr Cameron.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",101
"102","—I suppose, although you have been only two and a half years here, you have had some scholars who left the school with their elementary education completed? —Yes.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",102
"103","15879. How many have left since you have been here?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",103
"104","—I should say about a couple of dozen who were fairly good scholars.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",104
"105","15880. Can you say that these couple of dozen, when you turned them out from school, were able to speak English with anything like fluency?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",105
"106","—The most of them speak English very well, and those who speak it best are the best Gaelic readers.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",106
"107","15881. If a person met them on the road, could ha be able to understand them and make them understand his conversation in English?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",107
"108","—Quite well.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",108
"109","15882. Sheriff Nicolson.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",109
"110","—Are there any of your scholars who can read Gaelic ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",110
"111","—I believe there are some.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",111
"112","15883. How do they learn it?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",112
"113","—I cannot say how they learn it. Some of them can read Gaelic, and their parents cannot. I think the English assists them.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",113
"114","15884. Are there any of the Gaelic Society's schools in operation ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",114
"115","—I believe there is one at Sgigersta still in operation. The teacher of that Gaelic school was at one time appointed by the board to come to this school to give Gaelic instruction, and the former teacher left it to the option of the children to attend this class or not ; and in about three  months' time they dropped off. There were not more than a dozen at the beginning, and they dropped off to one, who was the teacher's son. ",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",115
"116","15885. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",116
"117","—They preferred something else to Gaelic ?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",117
"118","—They prefer the English.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",118
"119","15886. Sheriff Nicolson.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",119
"120","—The number attending that Gaelic school is very small?",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",120
"121","—Very small; some days it is not held at all, I believe.",288,"John Munro","Lewis, Ness",121
