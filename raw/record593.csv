"98","—Quite so.",593,"James Beaton","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",98
"99","35829. What do you think the people have on the whole to complain of ?",593,"James Beaton","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",99

"107","35833. Have the people here any difficulty in getting peats ?",593,"James Beaton","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",107

"109","35834. And those who are not feuars, can they go and cut peats ?",593,"James Beaton","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",109
"110","—If they do they have no right to do it.",593,"James Beaton","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",110
"111","35835. Are they charged money for it ?",593,"James Beaton","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",111

"115","35837. Do they pay for that?",593,"James Beaton","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",115

"117","former times to pay 2s. 6d. for it.",593,"James Beaton","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",117
"118","35838. Who was it that abolished that ?",593,"James Beaton","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",118
"119","—I don't know really whether it went to the Fisheries Societies or not; if it did not go, then it went to the factor.",593,"James Beaton","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",119
"120","35839. Who was it that relieved you of the obligation to pay the 2s. 6d. ?",593,"James Beaton","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",120
"121","—It dropped down dead; it was not asked.",593,"James Beaton","Argyll, Tobermory, Mull",121
