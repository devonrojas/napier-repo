"1","JOHN MACDONALD, Crofter and Fisherman, Harrapool (65)—examined. See Appendix A, XIII",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",1
"2","4593 The Chairman",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected a delegate from Harrapool ?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",3
"4","—Yes. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",4
"5","4594. Will you make any statement you have to make on the part of those who elected you?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",5
"6","—The name of our township is Harrapool, the meaning of which is ' the tail end of a quagmire,' and it is there our lots are laid out. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",6
"7","4595. Did you hear the statement of the last witness ?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",7
"8","—Yes. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",8
"9","4596. Do you agree with that statement in general'",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",9
"10","—Yes, quite. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",10
"11","4597. Then will you add anything which the previous delegate did not say ?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",11
"12","—I am paying rent in Harrapool thirty-eight or forty years, and in my early recollection my father was taking out of the ground that I have now the wherewith to enable him to rear eight or nine of a family without the necessity of buying. There was good reason for that. The township was taking into cultivation a part of the pasture when it was getting foggy, which enabled them to get food sufficient for themselves and their family, as the ground was strong. The ground officer was living in our township, and he reported to the factor that we were, by this way of cultivation spoiling the grass—both Sculamus and ourselves. The ground officer then came to the Sculamus people, and told them that they could not take in any part of the grazing, as they were spoiling the cows. The people told him that what they had for grazing, over and above what they cultivated, would do for their stock all summer. The ground officer then went to the factor and told him this, and the factor replied that if the people had as much pasture land over and above what they required for the grazing of their cattle he would find use for it. He then placed four families who had been cleared from Suishnish upon the Sculamus grazing. The grazing of the two townships is now spoiled with deer and rabbits. The factor was Mr Ballingall. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",12
"13","4598. Is it the same forest that the previous witness has spoken about ? ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",13
"14","—Yes, the deer from the same forest. The deer are through the whole district. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",14
"15","4599. Have you any promise of a fence there?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",15
"16","—No, but any one who will complain the answer is, ' I myself will take your holding.' The rabbits are causing us great loss. Several hundreds of them were killed this winter upon the grazing of our township and the neighbouring township. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",16
"17","4600. Who kills them?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",17
"18","—They are killed by the shooting tenant. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",18
"19","4601. Does he make any allowance? Does he pay any proportion of the price of the rabbits to them ?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",19
"20","—Not a penny. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",20
"21","4602. What does the shooting tenant do with the rabbits he kills ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",21
"22","—Sends them away in boxes. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",22
"23","4603. Does he ever give any of them to the crofters to eat ?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",23
"24","—No, not one—not even a foot. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",24
"25","4604. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",25
"26","—How long have the rabbits been there ? ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",26
"27","—It is only three or four years since they commenced to be a burden upon us. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",27
"28","4605. They have been there for ten years, I think ?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",28
"29","—They were not so numerous, but they are now destructive. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",29
"30","4606. Where did they come from?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",30
"31","—They came from Sleat. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",31
"32","4607. The Chairman.",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",32
"33","—Are you aware you have a right to kill the rabbits yourselves?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",33
"34","—No, we are not aware. The gamekeepers tell us that we dare not kill them. We don't try to kill them. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",34
"35","4608. If you have a right to kill them, have you any means of killing them ?—Do you know how to kill them ?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",35
"36","—We know that quite well, how to kill them with snares and traps. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",36
"37","4609. About the deer; have you ever asked the factor for a fence to keep the deer off?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",37
"38","—No; they are eating the corn of our two townships. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",38
"39","4610. But as the fence is being put up for the other township, would the factor not put one up for you too ?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",39
"40","—We did not ask him. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",40
"41","4611. How long would the fence be to enclose your arable ground against the deer ?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",41
"42","—It would take a mile, or fhree quarters of a mile. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",42
"43","4612. And how long would the fence be to go round the whole of the hill pasture ?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",43
"44","—That would take three miles. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",44
"45","4613 What other grievance have you?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",45
"46","—I made a great deal of work on my lot in the way of improving. One year I opened 360 yards of drains, and closed them up with stones. A few years after that my rent was raised, and my rent was raised before then, on account of the drainage money I got. This last money rise was 15d. or 18d. in the £. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",46
"47","4614. Do you mean your rent was raised on account of drainage money, and then raised on account of the drains you made yourself?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",47
"48","—My rent was raised 16s. about twenty years after I had opened these drains. It was Tormore who raised it. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",48
"49","4615 It was raised on account of the drainage money expended, and then it was raised again. Do you mean it was twice raised?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",49
"50","—I was not counting the drainage money that was laid upon me as an increase of rent, as I was to be relieved of it at the end of twenty years ; but instead of my rent being reduced at the end of twenty years, I had the 16s. added to it, and the drainage money kept up, and paving poor rates, and other rates upon the sum totaL Any one can understand that peaty ground must be getting exhausted, as the ground was formerly peat mosses, and a place that was never created for the habitation of man. We are for having increased holdings on which we could live. Though we have a few cows left us, we cannot take as much cut of the ground as would keep them alive. Besides, we spend three rents in supporting our families and cattle. Not only that, but we have to buy almost all the seed oats that we have to sow. Another thing I have to say. I had a brother in the township of Sculamus. He was at work in Glenelg, and died there. He left nine of a family. A few years after his death they were wanting to evict his widow and her children. I went security for her year's rent, in order to keep her in possession. The next year she was evicted. She was obliged to leave without getting compensation. It was I who paid the rent for her, and I got £2 back. She was a number of years occupying a half-ruined house with her nine children, the youngest of them being a year old and the oldest seventeen. Her son bought a stirk. She dared not build a place near her house where she could keep it. At last she got a bit of Breakish, and she is there still, but her children have left her. Some of them went to Australia. (see Appendix A. XIII)",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",50
"51","4616. Have the children succeeded in life ?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",51
"52","—They made a living of it wherever they went, but she is very poor indeed. It is one son that is supporting her with his earnings, ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",52
"53","4617. Did she bring up all her children without receiving any parochial relief ?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",53
"54","—She got very little assistance. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",54
"55","4618. Did she get some assistance?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",55
"56","—It was the parish that built the house for her. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",56
"57","4619. Did she get no weekly allowance ?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",57
"58","—If she did I do not remember it. It was myself who helped her most. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",58
"59","4620. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",59
"60","—Was it because she could not pay the rent that she was turned out of the house ?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",60
"61","—No, for I got £2 back of the rent which I paid for her. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",61
"62","4621. But that was for the roof of the house1?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",62
"63","—No. I gave £5 to the factor, and it was only £ 3 she was due. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",63
"64","4622. Why was she removed?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",64
"65","—She had very little stock. She had  not a summing. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",65
"66","4623. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",66
"67","—Who got her place at the time?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",67
"68","—A farmer who came from Suishnish. It is now occupied by two. ",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",68
"69","4624. Was it to accommodate them that she was removed ?",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",69
"70","—She was not owing any rent or arrears, and it was one of the Suishnish farmers who was placed in her stead. [Question repeated.]",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",70
"71","—Yes.",81,"John Macdonald","Skye, Broadford",71
