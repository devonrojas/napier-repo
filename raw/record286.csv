"1","JOHN MACDONALD, Crofter, South Dell, (57)—examined.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",1
"2","15738. The Chairman.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",2
"3","—Where is South Dell?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",3
"4","—About three miles west of this. ",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",4
"5","15739. Were you freely elected by the people?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",5
"6","—Yes.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",6
"7","15740. Have you got a statement to make ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",7
"8","—Regarding their poverty. I have more than time will allow me to tell. You have heard already of the small holdings and the high rents, and I need not enter into details on that matter. They are very poor. Some are in want of food. That is their sorest cry. The land is so heavily burdened that it cannot yield crop, and just as that is the case the land that is pastured on by sheep is, as it were, crying out to be cultivated. We complain of the heavy assessments. The schools are a very great burden upon us. We were not used to that burden, and our poverty scarcely can bear it well. We prefer the schools we had before. Our objection to the present mode of education is that the rule which the Almighty has given us for our salvation is treated as a boy plays at 'skippack,'—just a slap, and be done with it.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",8
"9","15741. Do you mean there is not sufficient time given for religious education ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",9
"10","—Yes, that it is merely a name. I have nothing to say against the late proprietor or against Lady Matheson, although they had bad managers under them, and just as the proprietors were badly served in our district so the Government is badly served in our district also. I must tell of a piece of impertinence where we were made a laughing stock of by the whipper-in of the children,—that is, the officer of the School Board,—just that he opened a letter that we were sending to Mr Mackay, the chamberlain. Mr Mackay himself knows about it. When there is such an amount of distress as that, these are not suitable people, as they would say in England, to administer a new colony. Our poverty would plead for patience and compassion in dealing with us. To put it in one word, the state of the place ought to be a matter of serious concern and humiliation to the people that are assembled here to-day. It is as though we were suffering from the wrath of the Almighty upon man's sin.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",10
"11","15742. You complain that the religious education is not sufficient. Do you think the children learn less of their religion now than they did formerly ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",11
"12","—I am quite certain that they do. They do not understand what they are learning.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",12
"13","15743. Do they learn the Shorter Catechism ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",13
"14","—A small portion at the beginning—the easy bit.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",14
"15","15744. Do they learn it in English or learn it in Gaelic?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",15
"16","—Oh! what but English, that they don't understand.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",16
"17","15745. Do they learn to read the Bible in Gaelic ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",17
"18","—No, not at all.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",18
"19","15746. Have you ever represented this complaint to the School Board ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",19
"20","—No, we did not.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",20
"21","15747. Are you dissatisfied with the present School Board?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",21
"22","—We complain of it.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",22
"23","15748. You know you can change the board at the next election ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",23
"24","—I believe we have that power.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",24
"25","15749. You said the Government was ill-served because the officer of the School Board had behaved in an overbearing manner. Now the officer is not a servant of Government, but is a servant of the School Board, and if you change the School Board the School Board can change the officer ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",25
"26","—I understand that quite well, but I wish to state in reply, that the officer when he did the act was quite convinced that he was backed by sufficient authority.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",26
"27","15750. To whom was the letter given?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",27
"28","—To the compulsory officer to bring it to the post office.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",28
"29","15751. Was the letter closed and sealed?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",29
"30","—Yes.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",30
"31","15752. Was it opened before it was put into the post office?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",31
"32","—It never was put into the post office.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",32
"33","15753. How do you know it was opened by the compulsory officer?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",33
"34","—Well, we went to search for that letter, and we could not get it in his house until his son would come home from school. We found it then, and we knew that it had been opened. There was an address upon it then in a different handwriting from the original one.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",34
"35","15754. Did you complain to Mr Mackay?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",35
"36","—He was spoken to about it at the School Board.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",36
"37","15755. What did Mr Mackay do ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",37
"38","—He said the man ought to be taken up.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",38
"39","15756. Was he taken up ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",39
"40","—The fiscal would have nothing to do with it, because he was not a servant of the post office.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",40
"41","15757. Has the School Board discharged the man?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",41
"42","—No.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",42
"43","15758. Do you think be ought to be discharged?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",43
"44","—Well, I do not want a man to be destroyed,—killed indeed,—but I wish that evil deeds should cease.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",44
"45","15759. They cease when they are made public?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",45
"46","—I wish that would come about.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",46
"47","15760. You complain about the school rate being so heavy. Now the minister told us yesterday that if all the children in the parish went to school the Government grant would be so large that there would scarcely be any rate at all. Have you ever been told that ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",47
"48","—Yes, I heard that, but every person in this district is not a minister, and as such, able to shoe his children so that they can go to school.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",48
"49","15761. But the children all over Scotland, at least in many parts, go to school without shoes ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",49
"50","—That is the case. There is no man here who is more anxious that children should be educated than I am, but I see clearly that cannot be done.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",50
"51","15762. Do you candidly think that the parents could not do a little more to send more of their children, and more regularly, to school ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",51
"52","—I believe that the parents do not in that sense do as much as they could. I am further of opinion that if the man who introduced the Bill into Parliament had been a Ness fisherman, or a fisherman on the West side of Lewis, he would not have introduced such a measure at all.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",52
"53","15763. But it is very difficult to make laws which are equally applicable to all places ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",53
"54","—That is quite the case.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",54
"55","15764. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",55
"56","—What is the name of the officer who opened your letter ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",56
"57","—Donald Murray, Tabost.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",57
"58","15765. Though you and your fellow-crofters know that you can change the School Board at next election, are you afraid of doing so, and thereby offending the higher powers? ",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",58
"59","—Yes, poverty causes us to be afraid.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",59
"60","15766. How many people are now living in your township ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",60
"61","—Fortyfive.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",61
"62","15767. Were you born there ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",62
"63","—No.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",63
"64","15768. How long have you been there ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",64
"65","—Fourteen years.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",65
"66","15769. How many were there fourteen years ago ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",66
"67","—Forty-one.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",67
"68","15770. Do you know how many were there fifty years ago?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",68
"69","—Thirty.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",69
"70","15771. Do you complain of being over-crowded as well as of high rent ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",70
"71","—Yes, we are.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",71
"72","15772. Do you know about the people who were removed from Galston ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",72
"73","—I ought to. I was born there, and my ancestors lived there.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",73
"74","15773. What was the name of the town you lived in ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",74
"75","—North Galston.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",75
"76","15774. How many families were removed from that town?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",76
"77","—There were over sixty of them. Fifty-four paid rent.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",77
"78","15775. Were there any more townships cleared besides North Galston ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",78
"79","—Other three.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",79
"80","15776. Name them?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",80
"81","—Balmeanach, Melbost, and South Galston. In Balmeanach there were ten families, in Melbost twenty-five, and in South Galston thirteen.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",81
"82","15777. Were these removed at one time, or did it run over several years ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",82
"83","—Over several years.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",83
"84","15778. How long altogether?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",84
"85","—Would it take ten years?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",85
"86","—They were removed at intervals during a period of twelve years.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",86
"87","15779. How long is it since the last clearance?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",87
"88","—Twenty years ago.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",88
"89","15780. Was the whole of this done in Sir James Matheson's time?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",89
"90","—The whole of it, and without his knowledge.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",90
"91","15781. Was it all done under the one chamberlain?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",91
"92","—No.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",92
"93","15782. Who were the two ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",93
"94","—Mr Munro Mackenzie to begin with, and then Mr Munro.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",94
"95","15783. What was done with the land from which these families were cleared ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",95
"96","—It was given to the tacksman.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",96
"97","15784. Was it the case that as each successive clearance took place the tack was enlarged ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",97
"98","—Yes, that was the case.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",98
"99","15785. Were you well off when you were living at North Galston ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",99
"100","—I could not ask to be better off.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",100
"101","15786. Was that the case with your co-crofters generally at the time?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",101
"102","—Almost the whole of them were so at first, but at a later period the tenants of South Galston were added on to them, and then they were not so well off.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",102
"103","15787. There seem to have been 108 families altogether, we shall say upwards of 100. What became of those families?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",103
"104","—About forty of them went to America. The rest was scattered all over the country.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",104
"105","15788. Was it against their will that they were put out of Galston?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",105
"106","—Yes, it was against our will, but we went away without being summoned.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",106
"107","15789. Was it for the benefit of the Galston people that they were turned out in this way and went some to America, and some to other places ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",107
"108","—I don't know one who benefited by it except one family.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",108
"109","15790. Who was the one family?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",109
"110","—Angus Graham, now in Shader.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",110
"111","15791. How did he benefit?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",111
"112","—He got better land where he went to than the land he was put out of.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",112
"113","15792. Why was he favoured?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",113
"114","—There was a reason for giving him a favour too ; he built a slated house in that place.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",114
"115","15793. Would you like to go back to North Galston?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",115
"116","—I would have some of my furniture there before I slept if I got it.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",116
"117","15794. In regard to the Gaelic, you stated that the children were not taught their religious knowledge, and especially that the want of instruction in Gaelic was against them. Is there any Sunday school in connection with any church where they teach the Bible ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",117
"118","—There is a Sabbath school in the schoolhouse up in our place for about an hour.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",118
"119","15795. Who teaches that ?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",119
"120","—The schoolmaster, with some assistants.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",120
"121","15796. Are they taught in Gaelic there to read the Bible?",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",121
"122","—I cannot tell, I will not allow any one to go to it myself anyhow. They are making a greater amount of mischief going and coming, than they are obtaining good within it.",286,"John Macdonald","Lewis, Ness",122
