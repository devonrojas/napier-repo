"1","JOHN MACARTHUR, Farmer, Ettridge (66)—examined.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",1
"2","43118. The Chairman.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",2
"3","—You desire to give evidence as to your experience and grievances regarding deer forests?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",3
"4","—Yes.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",4
"5","43119. Would you be so good as to make a statement?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",5
"6","—I have no statement",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",6
"7","43120. Then will you state what your hardships and what your grievances are?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",7
"8","—I am marching with the forest for a considerable distance, and I have been very much aggrieved ever since I came.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",8
"9","43121. How long have you been in the occupation of this farm of Ettridge?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",9
"10","—Seven years.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",10
"11","43122. Under a lease?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",11
"12","—Under a lease.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",12
"13","43123. What duration?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",13
"14","—Nineteen years.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",14
"15","43124. What is the nature of your farm—I mean with reference to arable and pasture?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",15
"16","—There is a good deal of pasture, but very little arable. ",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",16
"17","43125. What is your area of arable?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",17
"18","—I believe about 50 or 60 acres crop—not more at all events.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",18
"19","43126. What area of pasture?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",19
"20","—I believe it will be upwards of 20,000 acres.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",20
"21","43127. How many hirsels do you keep—how many shepherds?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",21
"22","—I keep five in the summer, and I keep double in the winter.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",22
"23","43128. Then you mean you have five hirsels; how large is your sheep stock ?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",23
"24","—About 6000.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",24
"25","43129. Cheviot stock?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",25
"26","—No; blackfaced.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",26
"27","43130. All blackfaced?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",27
"28","—All blackfaced.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",28
"29","43131. Is your arable enclosed and surrounded by your own pasture, or does it border at any point on the deer forest?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",29
"30","—No, it does not border at any point on the deer forest.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",30
"31","43132. It is surrounded all by your own pasture?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",31
"32","—Yes.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",32
"33","43133. Is there any substantial fence between your arable and your own pasture?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",33
"34","—Merely a wire fence.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",34
"35","43134. An ordinary wire fence—no stone dyke?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",35
"36","—No stone dyke.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",36
"37","43135. Have you any fence round your hill pasture?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",37
"38","—Partially now, but not before I came.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",38
"39","43136. Is it in the nature at all of a deer fence?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",39
"40","—No, it is not a deer fence, but merely a sheep fence.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",40
"41","43137. Do your farm and the adjacent forest belong to the same proprietor?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",41
"42","—No, they do not.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",42
"43","43138. Will you kindly give me the name of the proprietor of your farm?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",43
"44","—My own proprietor is Mr Macpherson of Belleville, with whom I have no grievance at all; I find him one of the best proprietors.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",44
"45","43139. Who is your neighbour —the proprietor of the neighbouring forest?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",45
"46","—I understand it is Sir George Macpherson Grant.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",46
"47","43140. When you entered on your farm, was the land belonging to Sir George Macpherson Grant under forest?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",47
"48","—It was.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",48
"49","43141. Well, now, when you entered, you were aware your farm was conterminous with a deer forest?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",49
"50","—I had no idea that I was joining a deer forest.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",50
"51","43142. You did not know?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",51
"52","—I did not know. I was never marching with a deer forest in my life before, old as I am, and I did not know it when I came to Badenoch.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",52
"53","43143. Was it not a subject on which you might naturally have made inquiry in taking the farm?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",53
"54","—I made no inquiry, because I was a long distance from it. I believe I was perhaps 150 miles away. I am a native of Argyllshire, and did not know anything about Badenoch when I came to it.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",54
"55","43144. But there are deer forests in Argyllshire?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",55
"56","—Very few.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",56
"57","43145. Do you complain of the aggressions of the deer?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",57
"58","—No, I do not complain of the aggressions of the deer at all, not so, much. I complain of the aggressions of the tenant and the landlord.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",58
"59","43146. Of the shooting tenant?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",59
"60","—Yes, and the landlord.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",60
"61","43147. What is the nature of these aggressions?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",61
"62","—When I came there I understood that my predecessors had bothies erected in the summer season. I only get the benefit of the neighbourhood of the forest in the summer months, and I very naturally put my sheep up there when I can get the benefit of it, because these high hills are covered with snow during seven months of the year. I put them all up there, consequent they cross over to the forest. My predecessors had bothies there and shepherds to keep them back, and so had I. I erected an iron bothy to make a permanent thing, because I concluded it would see out the termination of my lease, for I did not expect to see it out myself. Very well, I erected a permanent, bothy and my shepherd of course was there the whole season keeping my sheep back as my predecessors did, but still they were going over in spite of him. Well, the first two years I was very much aggrieved indeed with complaints from the head forester and from the tenant that my sheep were going over. I told them I used every precaution to keep them back, but could not, and when it is foggy weather for two or three days my sheep will go over in spite of the best shepherd, and then when they are putting them back they are disturbing the forest, which is a great grievance to the shooting tenant, and certainly very injurious to my stock. The second year I was gathering my stock, about the end of September, for marketing. I wrote to the principal keeper over there that I intended sending my shepherds in on such a day, and I hoped they would disturb the forest as little as possible, in order to get out my stock for marketing. I have still a farm in Argyllshire, and I had occasion to go there to look after it, and I left word with my manager, but a letter came in my absence prohibiting me going into the forest, and saying that legal proceedings would be taken against me if I entered the forest even for my own property. My men did not go on that occasion, and consequently I lost about £150 that year.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",62
"63","43148. On the sheep that strayed into the forest?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",63
"64","—I was not allowed to get back both ewes and wedders that I should have put away, and I calculated I lost £150 that year.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",64
"65","43149. What became of the sheep?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",65
"66","—The sheep I did get I sold at the Falkirk October Tryst for 34s. 6d., and I had my ewes sold previously for 22s.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",66
"67","43150. I want to know first of all what became of the sheep; were the sheep which you were not allowed to pursue and gather honestly restored to you by the keeper?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",67
"68","—I was prohibited from going in for three weeks. The consequence was I gathered all I could get upon my own ground, and sent them to market. At the end of three weeks I asked liberty to get in and got it. But between the time I sold my first lot and the last lot I was short of about £150, because the market came down.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",68
"69","43151. I quite understand your loss, but I do not yet see where the responsibility exactly lies. They were your sheep which were on your neighbour's property. May it not in some degree have been the fault of your shepherds in not watching the marches with sufficient strictness?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",69
"70","—I grant you all that, but we cannot do it. For instance, I am marching with the same forest a distance of eight or nine miles.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",70
"71","43152. Would your grievance be entirely set aside if there was a deer fence?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",71
"72","—Certainly it would, I would even be pleased with a sheep fence.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",72
"73","43153. Although it might not be as good as a deer fence, would the sheep fence not prevent your sheep straying upon the ground? Would it not be entirely a remedy for your grievance?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",73
"74","—Yes, it would be a remedy for my grievance that my stock would not trespass into the forest.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",74
"75","43154. Has your proprietor not a right at law to compel his neighbour to put a sheepfence ?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",75
"76","—I do not say but he has, but it becomes very expensive for my proprietor even to share the half. He has done a very great deal for me already, and if he will do this it will be more than I ever anticipated.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",76
"77","43155. Then it appears to me that the law provides a complete remedy for your present grievance?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",77
"78","—Well, I do not say but it does; but I say myself that the law is one-sided very much now in regard to deer forests. How in the name of goodness are deer forests more sacred ground than my land? I do not object to them coming over to my ground, and the deer come over in hundreds and they never heard me complain, yet about their deer.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",78
"79","43156. You never complained?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",79
"80","—I never complained yet to my neighbour about his deer coming over. ",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",80
"81","43157. Do they do you any harm?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",81
"82","—Of course they will not stand and look at the grass.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",82
"83","43158. Then you think it is hard that your proprietor should be obliged to pay half of this fence?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",83
"84","—I think so. ",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",84
"85","43159. Do you think that in a case of a conflict between a deer forest and a sheep farm, when a fence is necessary, the fence should be put up entirely at the cost of the proprietor of the deer forest?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",85
"86","—I say so, that it should be put up entirely at the expense of the proprietor of the deer forest, because he is getting an equivalent benefit, a very great deal more benefit than the grazing proprietor is getting. Besides a considerable portion of this forest that is marching with me was under sheep for two years after I came. There was no reason of complaint between that neighbour and me in the world, though there were some sheep going back and forward. We were all neighbourly, but now this portion of the farm is added to the forest and is made a sanctuary, so that I am the same as if I was beside a house of glass.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",86
"87","43160. Then your sheep have been feeding in the sanctuary?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",87
"88","—Not the slightest doubt. There is nothing to keep them out of it.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",88
"89","43161. Do the deer ever come down to your arable ground at all?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",89
"90","—No, they are very seldom seen in the arable ground.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",90
"91","43162. You have no complaint to make on that score?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",91
"92","—I have no complaint to make of the arable ground as to the deer, nor yet even for the grazing. I make no complaint, supposing they are over in hundreds. The only thing I complain of is the grievances I have with the shooting tenant of Gaick forest.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",92
"93","43163. And you think the neighbouring proprietor should be obliged to go to the expense of the whole fence?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",93
"94","—Perhaps between himself and his tenant.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",94
"95","43164. Mr Cameron.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",95
"96","—What year was it you suffered this loss by the sales of sheep?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",96
"97","—I think it was in 1879.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",97
"98","43165. Are you sure prices fell that year between the Inverness market and the Falkirk market?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",98
"99","—Not at all. I did not sell my sheep at the Inverness market, but I sold them at the Falkirk tryst for 32s. 6d., and for what I took out of Gaick I only got 25s. 6d. at Perth market, which was the only market I could send them to after the tryst was over.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",99
"100","43166. You lost your market?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",100
"101","—I lost my market, because I was not allowed to enter the forest for them.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",101
"102","43167. I do not quite understand what you mean by there being a one-sided law for forests. Do you mean to say that you have no right to go on to the ground of the tenant of the deer forest, but that the tenant of the deer forest has a right to come on yours?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",102
"103","—It looks very like what you say, because I should never think of interdicting the tenant of the forest",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",103
"104","from coming in upon my ground, but the proprietor and the tenant of Gaick summoned me to the Court of Session to get interdict against me. Of course they failed, fortunately for me and for the whole country. It was not granted. How could their land be more sacred than mine? I could never think of trying to interdict them from coming on to my ground, but they tried to interdict me from going on to their ground, even after my own property.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",104
"105","43168. Do you mean you have not a right to interdict them from coming on to your own ground?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",105
"106","—I don't believe it. I don't know whether I have the right, and even if I had it I would not put it in execution.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",106
"107","43169. Supposing you were told on good authority that you had as good a right to interdict all men, whether sheep farmer, tenant of deer forest, or proprietor of deer forest, from coming on to your ground, would you still say the law was one-sided?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",107
"108","—No, I certainly would not. ",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",108
"109","43170. Then there is another thing I do not quite understand. You told the Chairman that by the erection of a fence the owner of the deer forest would be the gainer, and therefore he ought to pay the expense?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",109
"110","—Yes. ",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",110
"111","43171. But, as I understand, the present complaint comes from the farmer; and, therefore, if the complaint comes from the farmer, the gain from the fence would be to the farmer too?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",111
"112","—The complaint always comes from the weaker side, not from the strong side. The strong side knows",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",112
"113","the law better than the weak side, and can put it in force because he has plenty at his back to do it with. Now, I am the weak side, and I have a very little at my back to spare, although perhaps I am as independent as he is with regard to what I take in hand. I do not want to throw anything away in law.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",113
"114","43172. But the question which the Chairman asked was at whose expense the fence should be erected, and your answer was that it should be at the expense of the deer forest owner, because he would be the gainer. Now, as I understand, the deer forest owner does not complain of anything. The complaint is by the tenant?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",114
"115","—I complained, in the first instance, that he interdicted me going into the forest, and took me to the Court of Session. Then I came to lay my grievance before you as Commissioners. That is the only thing that I have to do. It is immaterial to me how you take it, but I know I am very much aggrieved with the deer forest.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",115
"116","43173. But under the present law a fence may be erected on an application by one or two conterminous proprietors at their joint expense. You suggest it is a hardship upon your proprietor that he should be called upon to pay the half, and you think it should be paid by the owner of the deer forest. Perhaps what you mean is that as the owner of the deer forest gets a larger rent for his land, he therefore can better afford to pay for it?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",116
"117","—Yes, I mean that.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",117
"118","43174. But you will admit the damage done is done to the sheep farmer, because he is the person who comes and complains?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",118
"119","—Yes.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",119
"120","43175. And, therefore, a fence erected would be to the gain of the sheep farmer?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",120
"121","—It would be mo gain to the sheep farm.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",121
"122","43176. But it would be an advantage to the sheep farmer?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",122
"123","—I believe it would be a greater gain to the forest than to the sheep farm to keep the sheep out of the forest.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",123
"124","43177. To avoid disputes?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",124
"125","—To avoid disputes entirely.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",125
"126","43178. What is the length of this fence?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",126
"127","—I believe from end to end of the forest it would be seven or eight miles. But, let me tell you, a few miles of that have been erected within a few years.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",127
"128","43179. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",128
"129","—When hill lands are employed for the grazing of sheep, is there any necessity for fences between conterminous farms?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",129
"130","—None in the world, because there is seldom any complaint between ordinary farms.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",130
"131","43180. There is mutual trespass and mutual obligation ?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",131
"132","—Mutual obligation.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",132
"133","43181. It is only when on one side of the fence the land is cleared that it becomes a necessity to have a fence?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",133
"134","—Yes; when the forbidden fruit is on the other side of the fence we are all liable to go to it.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",134
"135","431S2. And you think, when a person clears his ground for the purpose of amusement, he should be the person who should be at the expense of putting up the necessary fence?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",135
"136","—I would say so.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",136
"137","43183. How many sheep had you in the forest when you lost the £150?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",137
"138","—I don't know, but I would have 400 or 500..",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",138
"139","43184. And you lost 7s. or 8s. apiece?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",139
"140","—I did indeed.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",140
"141","43185. You mentioned an attempt having been made to interdict you from getting into the forest; was that the exact object of the interdict? Was it for the purpose of preventing you getting to the sheep in the forest ?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",141
"142","—I was cited to the Court of Session with the expectation of getting interdict against me. My neighbours were going against me to prohibit me from going into the forest. Besides, I was threatened with legal proceedings about which there is a good deal of correspondence between us, and all my letters are in the hands of my agents in Edinburgh, or I could have brought them here. I was threatened with legal proceedings, and two years ago, or about twelve months ago, I was summoned to the Court of Session to protect myself against an interdict for going into the forest for my own property.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",142
"143","43186. You mentioned that part of the ground was fenced?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",143
"144","—Yes, now, within the last year or two.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",144
"145","43187. Did that fence answer the purpose at that point where it existed?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",145
"146","—It answered the purpose well enough as long as it stood, but the snow breaks it down, and my sheep went round the end of it. There is five or six miles not fenced yet, and my sheep go round the end of it and go in at the back of it.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",146
"147","43188. You were satisfied with it so far as it went?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",147
"148","—I was satisfied with it so far as it was a fence. They were threatened with being poinded over there, and on several occasions they have been gathering them down to the bottom of their own valleys. Their men would not let them get back the way they went forward, and they had twenty miles to travel before they got into their own hirsel again.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",148
"149","43189. Have you suggested that the fence should be extended?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",149
"150","—I suggested long ago that the fence should be extended, and not limited to the few miles it is. But I do not blame my proprietor at all. I tell you he is one of the best of proprietors. I have got a very great deal from him that there was no stipulation at all about.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",150
"151","43190. The Chairman.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",151
"152","—You have been in the habit of walking on the forest ground occasionally when you collected your sheep?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",152
"153","—I never walked on it in my life except on one occasion.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",153
"154","43191. I am sorry for that, because I wanted to ask whether you observed the condition of the pasture of the forest. Some people tell us that deer improve pasture and some tell us they injure it?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",154
"155","—If they do not keep grass for deer, deer will not be there. They must have grass to the point of their horns nearly.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",155
"156","43192. Suppose at this moment Sir George Macpherson Grant cleared his forest and put sheep back again, do you think the pasture would be found in worse condition than it was when under sheep?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",156
"157","—Certainly it would. It would be in worse condition under sheep than under deer.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",157
"158","43193. If he put it back to sheep again, would it be found to be in worse condition than it was years ago when it was under sheep; will the deer have done the pasture harm or good?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",158
"159","—I don't believe the deer have done it any harm.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",159
"160","43194. Then you think the pasture of the hills does not suffer from being cleared and lying under deer for a term of years?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",160
"161","—I don't believe it.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",161
"162","43195. You don't think it makes any difference either for good or evil?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",162
"163","—I don't believe it does; but I believe that land deteriorates under sheep.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",163
"164","43196. That is another question, but you don't think it deteriorates under deer?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",164
"165","—I have no great experience, I must say, about deer—none in the world.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",165
"166","43197. Now, about the deer getting on to your ground, supposing there was a sheep fence all the way along between you and the forest, a number of deer would get over the sheep fence into your ground?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",166
"167","—Yes.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",167
"168","43198. What would become of them; would they get freely back again over the sheep fence, or do you think they would remain about your ground, and not have as it were an equally free passage back to the forest? ",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",168
"169","—I would expect they would go back the same way as they would come forward if there was a sheep fence.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",169
"170","43199. You don't think they would be practically enclosed in any degree upon your ground?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",170
"171","—No. I do not believe it would keep the deer from entering into my ground, because I never made any complaint against them.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",171
"172","43200. But would the fence prevent the deer getting back again to the forest?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",172
"173","—No, it would not.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",173
"174","43201. Is the lie of the ground such that they would get back and forward equally?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",174
"175","—Yes, equally the same, I believe —perhaps not exactly, but it would not prevent them going one way or another.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",175
"176","43202. In fact, you would not catch the deer within your enclosure?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",176
"177","—No, and I would not attempt it. Suppose you put a rifle in my hand, I would not think it worth while to go to the railway station down there for one.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",177
"178","43203. You said you thought sheep deteriorated pasture?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",178
"179","—I believe they do.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",179
"180","43204. Explain how and why?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",180
"181","—I cannot see for myself how there is so much bone, wool, and flesh taken off the same land every year without deteriorating the land, and there is nothing put in there to replenish the grass except the droppings of the sheep, which are a mere bagatelle. Now, there is an extraordinary quantity of flesh, bone, and wool put off the land yearly, and nothing put in to replenish the ground for it.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",181
"182","43205. Do you find, practically speaking, that the pasture on your own farm is deteriorating?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",182
"183","—Yes, I do.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",183
"184","43206. Can you keep as numerous a stock as you did formerly?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",184
"185","—No, and that is the reason why I am at a very great deal more expense in wintering them than I was the first years I came in there.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",185
"186","43207. Though it is a blackfaced stock?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",186
"187","—A blackfaced stock.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",187
"188","43208. Mr Cameron.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",188
"189","—I should like to ask you a question about that, because we had some rather contradictory evidence in Inverness. A butcher informed us that winterings were no dearer now than they were fifteen years ago?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",189
"190","—It is my experience that they are dearer; and I will say another thing. I know that you, Lochiel, and the like of you, spoil us tenants very badly. I don't say you know of i t; but you send your managers out scouring the country for winterings. Then if I go for it—Oh, Lochiel's manager, and Sir John Ramsden's manager, and Sir Robert Menzies' manager, have been here, and we will get anything we want, and if you don't give that just move away.'",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",190
"191","43209. Might not that difficulty be got over if some of the sheep farmers came and took our farms?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",191
"192","—Let me tell you it will be a good job now for you if you get your farms let. You will appreciate your farmers when you get them.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",192
"193","43210. But if we cannot let our farms, how can you blame us for taking wintering for our sheep?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",193
"194","—It is not that you take wintering, but you take them far too high, and raise the wintering upon us down in the country. If your men were keeping them down, of course we could easily live. If I could sit upon another person's coat-tail, my word, I would make the purse long enough, but I am sitting on my own coat-tail unfortunately.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",194
"195","43211. Do you think that the managers for proprietors do not try to do the best they can for their employers and get wintering as cheap as they can?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",195
"196","—I don't know, but I know I can do better than they do. I know that perfectly, and can prove it. And you are not singular. There are plenty of the noblemen in the country that I can prove the same thing",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",196
"197","about, and I don't doubt but I have plenty witnesses here that I could bring forward to substantiate my statement.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",197
"198","43212. Sheriff Nicolson.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",198
"199","—What was the prayer of the petition in the interdict; was it to prevent you from entering upon the lands on the other side of your march—you or any persons coming under your authority?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",199
"200","—I believe it was, but when I got it I tell you honestly it made me shake. It is a thing I am not accustomed to.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",200
"201","43213. It was to prevent you from setting foot upon the deer forest?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",201
"202","—Yes. I sent it at once to my agent.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",202
"203","43214. Had you to appear at Edinburgh?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",203
"204","—No, I had not to appear. I believe I would have had to appear, but it was not granted.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",204
"205","43215. Was the petition refused?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",205
"206","—It was refused.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",206
"207","43216. Your agent appeared for you?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",207
"208","—My agent appeared for me.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",208
"209","43217. And the interdict was simply refused without ordering a proof?",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",209
"210","—I understand without ordering a proof.",703,"John Macarthur","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",210
