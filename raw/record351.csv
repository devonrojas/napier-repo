"1","ANDREW SPENCE, Crofter, Breakon, North (53)—examined.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",1
"2","19705. The Chairman.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",2
"3","—Are you a fisherman?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",3
"4","—No, I have been badly, and not able to attend the fishing.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",4
"5","19706. Have you any statement which you wish to make?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",5
"6","—Yes. I am living on a wasting property, as it is blown nearly away with sand; and if it had not been for the improvements my father made from the hill we would not have been living. Sixteen years ago, a man became factor of the land, and laid on a sum of £1 on the rent for the hill, and after that he railed in the hill and took it away altogether; so that I have nothing but a piece of land inside, and my animals I have to put out on other people's property.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",6
"7","19707. Does that statement apply to the other crofters in the same place?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",7
"8","—To a good many.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",8
"9","19708. When the hill was enclosed and taken away from the crofters, was there any reduction made on their rent?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",9
"10","—None for us.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",10
"11","19709. What stock do you keep at present?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",11
"12","—I have three Shetland cows.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",12
"13","19710. Ponies?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",13
"14","—Four ponies.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",14
"15","19711. Any sheep?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",15
"16","—None.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",16
"17","19712. How many acres of arable ground have you within the fence?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",17
"18","—It was called eight merks in the old Shetland style; but I think there are about three parts of it blown away. I suppose it is four merks or acres now.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",18
"19","19713. Three-fourths of it blown away?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",19
"20","—Yes, three merks I would reckon.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",20
"21","19714. Have you any idea how many acres according to our measure?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",21
"22","—No.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",22
"23","19715. What rent do you pay?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",23
"24","—£5 of rent, and 2s. of road money.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",24
"25","19716. When you had the hill, how much stock did you keep?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",25
"26","—Just the same as we keep now, I believe. I could not exactly say, because I was away at the time, and my father had possession.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",26
"27","19717. You think the crofters keep as much stock now as they did when they had the common pasture of the hill?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",27
"28","—Some of the heritors left when the scathold or hill was divided, and gave their tenants enough off the hill to serve them; others took it away altogether.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",28
"29","19718. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",29
"30","— Had you no sheep when you had the scathold land?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",30
"31","—Yes, but the man who took possession of the scathold land brought sheep into the district, and there was scab came amongst them, and killed them off, and it is still amongst ours. The farmers dipped their sheep, but we just poured the dip on ours, and in winter they all died. Some have sheep still, and others none.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",31
"32","19719. The Chairman.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",32
"33","—Do those who have sheep pay more than the others, or do they all pay the same?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",33
"34","—Every man pays according to the land he has. The crofters alongside of me hold under the Earl of Zetland. They hold 11 merks, and pay £5 a year; but it is on a wasting property. The Earl of Zetland left sufficient hill for the stock they had when the scathold was divided. ",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",34
"35","19720. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",35
"36","—Who is your proprietor?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",36
"37","—Major Andrew Cameron. ",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",37
"38","19721. Has he a factor in North Yell?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",38
"39","—Yes, a very fine man; but of course, he could not go beyond Major Cameron's orders or the way he found the property after Walker left it. Walker, who took away the hill, left some years ago; and the gentlemen who is in it now just has it something as he found it. Walker wronged every person, and would not have cared whether the sheep were put under a dyke or what we did with them. I believe he spoiled the major.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",39
"40","19722. Did you make any representation to Mr Walker that the rents should be reduced when the scathold was taken away?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",40
"41","—I only paid the rent to him two or three years, and he gave me no satisfaction.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",41
"42","19723. But you did represent it to him?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",42
"43","—Yes.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",43
"44","19721. Your complaint is that you have lost the scathold, and have not had any reduction of rent in consequence?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",44
"45","—Yes, I want some of the scathold back if it were possible —some of the hill back belonging to the property.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",45
"46","19725. You said you had to pay others for keeping your stock; do you pay for the grazing of cows or ponies?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",46
"47","—No, I graze them on the property I pay for; but what I put on the hill I feed on other property, or I could not keep so many animals.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",47
"48","19726. The Chairman.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",48
"49","—What about your house?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",49
"50","—The last factor that came in to act for Major Cameron repaired our houses; we have no complaint against the house,",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",50
"51","19727. Is it the custom in your place that the proprietor builds the house?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",51
"52","—Yes, I believe the house was built by the proprietor first. I could not say when it was built, but I am the fourth occupant.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",52
"53","19728. But is it the general custom that the proprietor builds or helps you to build the house?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",53
"54","—Yes.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",54
"55","19729. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",55
"56","—How many of the crofters are in the same position as yourself?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",56
"57","—There are a great many.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",57
"58","19730. How many people are complaining like yourself?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",58
"59","—I could not say, but there are a great many.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",59
"60","19731. How many people have the same cause of complaint as you have?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",60
"61","—A great many, but I could not say the number.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",61
"62","19732. How many families are there in your town —how many crofters altogether?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",62
"63","—In our town there are from twenty to thirty, but they are not all under the same landlord.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",63
"64","19733. And is it only the condition of the tenants of the one that you complain about?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",64
"65","—I have only one landlord. The other tenants are complaining, but they don't bring in their case because we expected you on the 20th, and you are only come now. A telegram came from Lerwick last night, and they had not time to take their place along with us.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",65
"66","19731. But there are thirty crofters?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",66
"67","—From twenty to thirty.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",67
"68","19735. Who has got the scathold land which was taken from you?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",68
"69","—Major Cameron's factor has it, I believe.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",69
"70","19736. It is one big farm, is it not?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",70
"71","—It was made into parks—a sheepfarm.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",71
"72","19737. Have you any idea how many acres would be in that land which was taken away from your predecessors, and is now in this sheep farm—is it a big farm?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",72
"73","—Our little bit is not a great many acres.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",73
"74","19738. Was the hill ground taken altogether?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",74
"75","—A great many acres; I could not really say how many, because I was not at home at the time, and have no idea; but it is a great quantity of hill.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",75
"76","19739. You say no allowance was made for you in the rent that was taken from you?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",76
"77","—-No, Walker laid on £1 , I was led to understand, and it was never taken off. He took away the hill; we have only liberty to cut our peat.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",77
"78","19740. Is there any reason why you could not get back the land; it is not let upon lease?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",78
"79","—-I could not say how it is exchanged; it is exchanged, I understand, to another man, more especially the piece that belonged to the croft that I held.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",79
"80","19741. Have you ever seen your proprietor himself?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",80
"81","—No.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",81
"82","19742. Does he ever come to North Yell?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",82
"83","—I am not aware, but I have seen his factor, and he would have been inclined to have done something, but it appears things are in such a case that he just has it as he found it.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",83
"84","19743. How long has Major Cameron been proprietor?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",84
"85","—He got the property from his father.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",85
"86","19744. And how long is it since his father died?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",86
"87","—I really cannot say.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",87
"88","19745. Is it a long time?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",88
"89","—I believe it is about twenty or thirty years back; but I could not exactly say, because I was not here at the time.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",89
"90","19746. Are you and your neighbours impoverished in your circumstances, in consequence of the taking away of this ground?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",90
"91","—My next neighbour belongs to the Earl of Zetland's property, and the Earl left sufficient hill for their stock, so that they are not impoverished. But some of their land was blown away, and they have got a reduction of rent.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",91
"92","19747. Are your own circumstances worse in consequence?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",92
"93","—I am hemmed in, and the other tenants throw it up to me that I am putting animals on their property.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",93
"94","19748. Are there other people impoverished in their circumstances in consequence of being deprived of land?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",94
"95","—Yes, I believe there are. The hill was common belonging to all men, and they came and took it  away from us.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",95
"96","19749. Is the ceasing of keeping sheep rather a loss to you?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",96
"97","—A great loss.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",97
"98","19750. Was it the native sheep you kept?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",98
"99","—Yes, the Shetland sheep.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",99
"100","19751. The Chairman.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",100
"101","—Did you use the wool of the native sheep for making clothes at home?",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",101
"102","—Yes, stockings and blankets, and the old people made outside clothes of it also.",351,"Andrew Spench","Unst, Baltasound",102
