"1","DONALD STEPHEN, Northtown, Birsay (36)—examined.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",1
"2","24164. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",2
"3","—What is your profession?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",3
"4","—A farmer's son and small proprietor.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",4
"5","24165. Do you occupy any land besides what you own?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",5
"6","—I work on my father's farm.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",6
"7","24166. Is this property your father's or your own?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",7
"8","—My father is tenant.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",8
"9","24167. But you are a proprietor besides?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",9
"10","—Of a small bit of ground.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",10
"11","24168. Is that yours or your father's?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",11
"12","—My own.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",12
"13","24169. And your father is tenant?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",13
"14","—Yes.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",14
"15","24170. What extent of land does your father hold ?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",15
"16","—Seventy-seven",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",16
"17","24171. What extent of property do you possess?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",17
"18","—Sixteen acres.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",18
"19","24172. Did you purchase this property?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",19
"20","—Yes.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",20
"21","24173. How long have you held it?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",21
"22","—Four years.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",22
"23","24174. Was it arable land when you bought it?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",23
"24","—No, common.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",24
"25","24175. To whom did it belong?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",25
"26","—To a proprietor in Aberdeenshire of the name of Park.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",26
"27","24176. Were there others beside you who bought common land at that time?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",27
"28","—No, it was a part of infield property, and this was outfield common. It was for sale by private bargain at the time.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",28
"29","24177. What price did it sell for?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",29
"30","—I would not like to mention the price because I am, perhaps, for selling it again.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",30
"31","24178. Is it entered in the valuation roll'?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",31
"32","—Yes.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",32
"33","24179. For what rent?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",33
"34","—£5.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",34
"35","24180. For the sixteen acres?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",35
"36","—Yes.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",36
"37","24181. Have you reclaimed it?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",37
"38","—Part of it.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",38
"39","24182. Was that £5 put on before you reclaimed it?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",39
"40","—No, since there have been improvements on it.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",40
"41","24183. Is there a house on it?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",41
"42","—No house at present.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",42
"43","24184. Does your father hold his land upon lease?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",43
"44","—Yes.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",44
"45","24185. What length of lease?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",45
"46","—I think there are about six years to run.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",46
"47","24186. Was it a fourteen or a nineteen years' lease?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",47
"48","—I am not exactly",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",48
"49","sure; I think it was for thirteen years.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",49
"50","24187. Was his an improving lease?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",50
"51","—-Yes.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",51
"52","24188. Was the land uncultivated when he entered upon it?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",52
"53","—We reclaimed about forty-five acres since we came to the property about eighteen years ago.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",53
"54","24189. Is he to receive compensation for it at the close of the lease?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",54
"55","—Unfortunately no.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",55
"56","24190. He thought, when he took the lease, the length of lease would be sufficient compensation for it?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",56
"57","—I suppose so.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",57
"58","24191. Has it been profitable?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",58
"59","—No, unfortunately it has not. It may be a good illustration of how landlordism has been in this country. During the last eighteen years we have reclaimed about forty-five acres; drained it, and tilled it, and put out more money in the reclamation than the property cost eighteen years ago. Some of the ground was a loch at one time; we have drained it, and in some parts we put down 400 loads of stones to the acre. It is all stone drains. Every dry year we get no crop out of it; and in a wet year we get no crop either. It requires a medium year, or a dropping year. In the field we reclaimed there are no turnips this present year, although it was sown with turnips. We have built a house upon it, and we received no assistance from the proprietor, and I suppose at the end of the lease the proprietor can turn us away without any compensation, and that is where the hardship comes in.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",59
"60","24192. What rent have you been paying?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",60
"61","—About £15 a year.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",61
"62","24193. There were about thirty-five acres improved when you entered?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",62
"63","—No, there were scarcely that; it was in a very bad state. The proprietor who had it then had two tenants—there was a double building—and the two tenants removed and sold off their crop. The next tenant had it for a year and rouped off the crop. The next tenant was two years in it; he had nothing to put upon it when he came, and the second year he rouped off the produce. We then entered. The first year we came, in the month of April, we had nothing but artificial manure en it, and we have been in it since. The farm was in a very run-out state when we entered, and it took a number of years to put it in proper condition. Since then we have reclaimed about forty-five acres, or I may say I have  ploughed myself about fifty acres of virgin soil, and we have spent more money on improving than the property comes to. ",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",63
"64","24194. And the land which you have reclaimed is not very good land altogether?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",64
"65","—It is second class land. ",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",65
"66","24195. But the land you found under cultivation is of better quality?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",66
"67","—It is very good ground, but there are only about fourteen acres of it.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",67
"68","24196. You have put that into good heart?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",68
"69","—Yes, it is in good heart. We used about five cwt. of artificial manure, and twenty or thirty loads of",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",69
"70","farm-yard manure.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",70
"71","24197. What does a load weigh here?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",71
"72","—About half a ton; and it takes usually about fifteen tons to dung an acre.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",72
"73","24198. What class of stock do you keep?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",73
"74","—We imported a pure bull from Aberdeenshire the other year.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",74
"75","24199. And you breed a cross stock ?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",75
"76","—Yes.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",76
"77","24200. What do your two-year-olds fetch?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",77
"78","—We sell them when they are about six quarters old and get about £16.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",78
"79","24201. Do your neighbours keep equally good stock?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",79
"80","—They have been using the same bull which we keep, and their stock is very good.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",80
"81","24202. Is yours the only bull in the parish of that class?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",81
"82","—There are only other two—I suppose Mr Leask of Bordhouse and Mr Bratch of Swanie; but some of the other farmers occasionally take down a pure bull.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",82
"83","24203. Is the land which you have purchased a good quality of land?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",83
"84","—No.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",84
"85","24204. Does it adjoin the land you rent?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",85
"86","—Yes.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",86
"87","24205. You proposed to work them together?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",87
"88","—Yes.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",88
"89","24206. Do you look forward to having to pay higher rent or to being removed?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",89
"90","—I could not say; it is a new proprietor who is on just now. He is a relation of my own; he is my uncle.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",90
"91","24207. Mr Cameron.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",91
"92","—Was any stipulation made in your lease at the commencement about reclaiming the land?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",92
"93","—It was understood that we would have to reclaim it.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",93
"94","24208. If it was understood you had to reclaim it, I suppose that was taken into consideration in fixing the rent, was it not?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",94
"95","—Most certainly it would require to be taken into consideration, because it is not to be expected that the tenant would sink his capital in another man's land and get no compensation.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",95
"96","24209. And you preferred the compensation in your rent rather than at the end of your lease?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",96
"97","—We have paid more than was calculated for at first.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",97
"98","24210. The land you drained has no crop in a dry year and none in a wet year?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",98
"99","—It is so, and it can be seen this year.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",99
"100","24211. You could not expect much compensation for improvement of that kind?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",100
"101","—The money is sunk upon the property.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",101
"102","24212. But if it is sunk unprofitably it would be rather hard to expect the landlord, whether your uncle or not, to pay for it?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",102
"103","—It was loch at one time, and that money was sunk in it; and I made dry land, which is a permanent improvement.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",103
"104","24213. It would be a permanent improvement if you succeeded in growing crops, but if you don't succeed in doing that, it is surely not much of an improvement'!",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",104
"105","—But when one uses the means.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",105
"106","24214. You endeavoured to make an improvement and it did not turn out to be an improvement?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",106
"107","—Some years.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",107
"108","24215. Did your father occupy himself in any other way besides farming?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",108
"109","—No, he was a farmer before he came to the country.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",109
"110","24216. Did he find the money with which you bought the land?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",110
"111","—It was my uncle who bought the land.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",111
"112","21217. No, but your own land?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",112
"113","—No, it was money I saved up myself.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",113
"114","24218. Did you save it up as a farmer, or as a labourer?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",114
"115","—As a labourer; I wrought on his farm.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",115
"116","24219. What is the quality of the land which you say is good land—producing good crop—how would you describe the soil of it?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",116
"117","—It is one of those black soils full of vegetable matter.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",117
"118","24220. And how would you describe the bad laud?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",118
"119","—As thin gravelly soil, or perhaps a stiff boulder soil.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",119
"120","24221. With a good deal of clay mixed up in it?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",120
"121","—White clay of the burning kind.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",121
"122","24222. What crops do you find succeed best in the land which is good?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",122
"123","—Oats.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",123
"124","24223. Does it grow good turnips?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",124
"125","—Some years; it depends on whether there is moisture or a good deal of sunshine. When there is a deficiency of sunshine and a prevalence of cold east winds, the crop is usually stunted.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",125
"126","24224. Professor Mackinnon.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",126
"127","—What part of the country do you come from ?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",127
"128","—Wick parish, Caithness.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",128
"129","24225. You were brought up to farming all your life?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",129
"130","—-Yes.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",130
"131","24226. You said that the amount of money you have spent upon this place is more than what purchased it eighteen years ago; would the purchase price of it to-day be double the amount of what it was eighteen years ago?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",131
"132","—It would depend upon what the demand for the land was.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",132
"133","24227. But as demand goes in this place?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",133
"134","—Yes.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",134
"135","24228. So that to the proprietor, then, your outlay is no loss?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",135
"136","—To the landlord it is not possible, when it is 150 per cent, profit.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",136
"137","24229. Then the place would fetch more than double the price it fetched eighteen years ago?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",137
"138","—I would think so, when I called it 150 per cent, added to the purchase price.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",138
"139","24230. In order to make things fair for the tenant, for yourself, what change would you propose to make in the term of giving leases or the like of that?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",139
"140","—I would propose that all permanent improvements ought to be paid to the man who made them; take the difference of the valuation on entry and raise the rent on the termination of the lease.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",140
"141","24231. How would you estimate the permanent improvements?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",141
"142","—Such as the making of roads and building of houses and drainage. Perhaps a piece of ground only worth Is. per acre, or 6d. an acre, at the termination of a lease may be worth 30s. an acre, and the difference between that and the price when the lease was taken should be paid to the man who made it worth that.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",142
"143","24232. The difference between the letting value of the land just now and its letting value twenty years hence— would you consider that represented the permanent improvement upon the part of the tenant?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",143
"144","—We don't know what the letting value might be twenty years to come—what progress the country will make.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",144
"145","24233. Does not that introduce another element—the progress of the country?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",145
"146","—Perhaps it may from the landlord's point of view, but when the tenant has made the country—for instance, a landlord lets his land to a tenant, and the tenant puts in drains, and the landlord gives the use of the land and Government money. The tenant does the cartage and gets numbers of horses killed, perhaps, and makes himself an old man before he has come to manhood, and at the end of his lease the landlord gets a property of enhanced value, and Government money expended upon it, while he has expended nothing. Is not the man who has made it, less this money, the man who is entitled to compensation?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",146
"147","24234. But it would be a difficult thing to calculate the amount of the compensation?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",147
"148","—A tenant would not have much difficulty in calculating it. Supposing the property was worth Is. per acre when the tenant entered it, and was at the end worth 20s., less the taxes, should it not then belong to the man who made it worth that. ",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",148
"149","24235. You stated you expended a large amount of money upon it. Now you would not consider you would require to get the whole of that back at the end of the lease ?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",149
"150","—-I don't expect to get the whole of it back, but only a fair share of it, less the taxes. At the  termination of the lease it would appear in the valuation roll at a higher value, and less taxes upon that",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",150
"151","—that deducted, to whom does the balance belong unless to the man who made it so?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",151
"152","24236. You would ask the difference between the letting value at the beginning and end of the lease, less the taxes?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",152
"153","—One would naturally suppose so, to make it fair for both parties if the landlord invested nothing in the property.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",153
"154","24237. And you think that would be fair terms for a lease in the future?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",154
"155","—Well, I would not like to say that the landlord should be tied down, or that the tenant ought to be the slave of the landlord; let them make a fair, open, honest bargain, and let both parties stand by that. But there is such keen competition for the land, that farmers are led to give a higher value than the property is worth, and they must do that or emigrate.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",155
"156","24238. What remedy would you provide for that?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",156
"157","—That is a very wide question. The usual remedy in some districts you have gone over is to ship them over to America and give them £100 per family to settle them down.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",157
"158","24239. In order to diminish the competition?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",158
"159","—It would diminish the competition but not in a country perhaps like this. Perhaps land can scarcely be extended profitably here. And then, there is very heavy taxation in this country.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",159
"160","24240. Do you think it is heavier than it need have been?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",160
"161","—That is a question which requires a good deal of consideration. Some parishes are heavier taxed than others. This parish is very heavily taxed with regard to lunatics, and I think that charge should be an imperial one.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",161
"162","24241. Instead of a local rate, you think part of that should be levied upon the imperial taxation?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",162
"163","—Yes.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",163
"164","24242. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",164
"165","—It is so just now, half of it?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",165
"166","—But not a fair share.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",166
"167","24243. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",167
"168","—You have told us that you bought this land with your own money, although you don't feel disposed to mention the amount. Have you ever been a ploughman in service except with your father?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",168
"169","—No.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",169
"170","24244. When did you begin to get money as wages from your father?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",170
"171","—I suppose when he found that I was earning more than the cost of the clothes I was getting.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",171
"172","24245. When about sixteen or eighteen years of age would you begin to get some money?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",172
"173","—I suppose it was very little I was getting at that time.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",173
"174","24246. Out of the money you got from him you purchased this property?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",174
"175","—Certainly.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",175
"176","24247. You did not engage in any other business?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",176
"177","—Sometimes I did a little in dealing.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",177
"178","24248. You might buy a beast and sell it?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",178
"179","—Yes.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",179
"180","24249. But still the money was all made by yourself?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",180
"181","—All.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",181
"182","24250. How many times what you gave for your land would you now expect to get for it ?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",182
"183","—That is a very nice way of putting it, but I don't feel inclined to answer that. But if you are inclined to purchase the land I will be most happy to show you it.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",183
"184","24251. Is there any reason why other people in your position should not have done as well as you have done?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",184
"185","—One thing, I don't drink or smoke the money; perhaps what other people would spend in that I save.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",185
"186","24252. You have thereby been enabled to put by more than you otherwise would have done?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",186
"187","—No doubt of it.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",187
"188","24253. But suppose, then, another model young man like yourself who does not drink or smoke, is there any reason to prevent his doing what you have done—putting by money to purchase land?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",188
"189","—Perhaps the young men may emigrate to America, and come back and make themselves proprietors.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",189
"190","24254. But at home, could not young men do as you have done?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",190
"191","—Well, they would require to be very careful, their wages here are only £ 10 to £18 or £20 in the year, with, perhaps, six or eight bolls of meal.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",191
"192","24255. Following out what you have said as to yourself; supposing you got the money you want, what would you do with it?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",192
"193","—I would just invest it again.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",193
"194","24256. In lands?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",194
"195","—In what I might think most profitable.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",195
"196","24257. Would you be disposed to invest it again in land ?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",196
"197","—Well, at the present time there is a great demand for land, and the lawyers are very ready in offering money that it is perhaps sometimes an inducement for parties to put their money in land, as they consider it safer to have a few acres than to invest otherwise.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",197
"198","24258. Would you really increase your holding in land—was that your intention ?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",198
"199","—At the present time there is no interest can be attained by putting money in land.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",199
"200","24259. The return is so poor?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",200
"201","—It is. I know that I have been considerably out of pocket by investing my money in land.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",201
"202","24260. You have no intention, however, of leaving the country supposing you realise your property. You do not intend to emigrate ?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",202
"203","—The money I have would not carry me very far, and perhaps it might be as well to stay here as to go away. There is a suggestion I should like to bring under the notice of the Commissioners with regard to the law of hypothec : I think it should be abolished; I think it is very injurious to the farmer.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",203
"204","24261. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",204
"205","—You are rather outside the class of farmers into whose cases we are sent to inquire; do you think it is injurious to the crofter?",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",205
"206","—Yes, in many cases. Take, for instance, the case of a young man who has a few pounds and friends to give him money, there is no security for these parties who lend him the money. Perhaps at the end of a few years he may fall into arrears, and the landlord would come down upon him.",412,"Donald Stephen","Orkney, Birsay",206
