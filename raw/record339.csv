"2","(See Appendix A, L.)",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",2
"3","18432. The Chairman.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",3
"4","—What is your profession?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",4
"5","—Fisherman and crofter.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",5
"6","18433. Were you elected by the people of South Connigsburgh?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",6
"7","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",7
"8","18431. Will you tell us how you were chosen?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",8
"9","—They just wished me to come here. Mr Clark, minister, and I were asked to come and represent the case.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",9
"10","18435. Was there a meeting?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",10
"11","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",11
"12","18436. About how many people were at the meeting?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",12
"13","—A good many; most of the tenants were—most of the men.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",13
"14","18437. The crofters and fishermen?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",14
"15","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",15
"16","18438. Were there fifty or sixty, or more?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",16
"17","—No, not that many.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",17
"18","18439. Twenty or thirty?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",18
"19","—About twenty.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",19
"20","18440. And how many delegates did they elect?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",20
"21","—Only Mr Clark, the minister, and I.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",21
"22","18441. And John Smith?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",22
"23","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",23
"24","18442. Is he here?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",24
"25","—I do not know.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",25
"26","18443. Have you got any letter to present on the part of the people?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",26
"27","—Mr Clark had the minute of the meeting.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",27
"28","18444. Will you be so good as to make a verbal statement ?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",28
"29","—In the first place, we complain about our rents being raised some time ago. Our lands were raised very nearly a third, and some more that, about ten or twelve years ago. Some were raised as high as 13s. in the pound. ",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",29
"30","18445. How many years ago?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",30
"31","—About ten or twelve years ago. ",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",31
"32","18446. What else?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",32
"33","—We found it was intolerable for us to pay this. We saw we could not pay it, and a lot of the men went to the proprietor land told him we could not pay it, and that we must have some reduction.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",33
"34","18447. Who was the proprietor?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",34
"35","—Mr John Bruce, jun., of Sumbrugh.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",35
"36","18448. What happened then?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",36
"37","—Then he drew out a statement for us to sign, that we would agree to fish to him from that day forward any time he might start a fishing station; and we were not to lodge another fisherman without he fished for Mr Bruce; or, if a father has sons, and they objected to fish for Mr Bruce, they would have to go. He gave some a reduction of 5s. and some more or less, when they signed that document. But I never signed this, to bind myself for lifetime; and each man only got so much when he did sign it",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",37
"38","18449. Mr Cameron.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",38
"39","—Have you a copy of that paper?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",39
"40","—No; Mr Clark has it.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",40
"41","18450. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",41
"42","—Where is he?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",42
"43","—He is not through.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",43
"44","18451. Has he come?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",44
"45","—Yes, he was to come by land; I came by sea.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",45
"46","18452. You think he is on the way?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",46
"47","—Yes, I think so; he told me last night he was to be here decidedly to day. A few years after that, the",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",47
"48","landlord came and took away our scathold from us —our hill pasture. He came with another paper for us to sign to give it up, and perhaps it would do us no harm. Most of the tenants signed that they would give it up, but it was greatly against their wills. But they could do no other, because it was said we might be sent off if we disappointed the landlords and a good many signed it against their wills, to give up the hill.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",48
"49","18453. The Chairman.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",49
"50","—Did he take the whole hill, or a portion of it?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",50
"51","—He took the whole hill first, and we had a debate with him, and we got back a portion of the worst of the hill, where our turf was cut after paying £20 for shifting his wire. The money was raised by us, and paid for shifting the wire.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",51
"52","18454. Did he give you a reduction of rent when he took away the hill?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",52
"53","—Not a penny.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",53
"54","18455. How much of the hill pasture before was taken away?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",54
"55","—Nearly three miles in the side of the square.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",55
"56","18456. Three miles?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",56
"57","—Three each way.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",57
"58","18457. How much of that did they give you back?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",58
"59","—We did not get, I think, but half a mile on the side of the square. It is a little angular, but if it were measured square, I don't think it would be much over half a mile. In addition to this, we have three days' work in the year for each merk of land we hold.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",59
"60","18458. Has that always been paid?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",60
"61","—Yes, that is in addition; and we have to pay a fowl for each man, with our raised rents.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",61
"62","18459. Anything else?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",62
"63","—That is about all.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",63
"64","18460. Mr Cameron.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",64
"65","—How many crofters are there in your district?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",65
"66","—Perhaps forty or sixty, more or less.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",66
"67","18461. How far do they live apart from each other?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",67
"68","—Some live pretty close to one another, and some perhaps half or three quarters of a mile; the land is all divided, and each man has a bit all round him.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",68
"69","18462. But how far would it be from the extreme end of the village to the other end; how far does one man live from his furthest off neighbour?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",69
"70","—Pretty near two miles.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",70
"71","18463. The crofts extend over a space of two miles?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",71
"72","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",72
"73","18464. How far do crofts extend to the back; how much hill pasture have you?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",73
"74","—Only a little bit, about two miles from the sea. ",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",74
"75","18465. What amount of stock is kept by the crofters?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",75
"76","—Generally a cow and a pony. The smallest croft can only keep a cow, because we have no pasture for them to feed on; and if we keep more, we must lay down the croft to raise grass.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",76
"77","18466. And no sheep?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",77
"78","—Some have a few sheep kept on other men's scatholds. They get permission from the holders to keep one or two sheep, but a good many have none at all.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",78
"79","18467. But no sheep are kept in the land properly occupied by these crofters?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",79
"80","—No, there is no room.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",80
"81","18468. How much arable land is there on each croft?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",81
"82","—From five to ten acres; they vary a little. Five acres would be about the average, but I don't think the highest would much exceed ten acres.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",82
"83","18469. Under what system of cropping is that land worked?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",83
"84","—I think oats, bere, and potatoes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",84
"85","18470. How many shifts do you put it into?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",85
"86","—Generally potatoes, then bere, then oats, and then it will come to bere again, and then to potatoes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",86
"87","18471. And no grass at all?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",87
"88","—The most is laid down in grass; the best ground is never laid to grass. I am forty years on it, and there is some of the croft I never remember being laid to grass.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",88
"89","18472. What steps do you take to renew the richness of the soil, which must be exhausted by that system?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",89
"90","—By manure.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",90
"91","18473. What kind?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",91
"92","—Sea-weed chiefly, because we are prevented from taking the soil off the hill. We used to go to the hill, and take off the soil and mix it with cow-dung to make manure; but we are greatly prevented from taking this now, and the most we use is sea-weed.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",92
"93","18474. Of course, you don't buy any artificial manure?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",93
"94","—No, we are not able to buy it.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",94
"95","18475. And you can make very little farm-yard manure with one cow?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",95
"96","—Very little.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",96
"97","18476. Is it the experience of the older people that the land has deteriorated in quality owing to cropping?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",97
"98","—Materially, since we were prevented from taking the soil out of the hills to make manure.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",98
"99","18477. Is that your own experience?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",99
"100","—Yes, it is my own experience.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",100
"101","18478. Do you find much difference in the seasons; are they worse?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",101
"102","—No, they are sometimes better and sometimes worse—much the same as before.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",102
"103","18479. What is the ordinary rent paid by each crofter in this village?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",103
"104","—I do not think there is any so high as £12, and those on the smallest crofts will be paying £3 to £4.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",104
"105","18480. Does a man who has five acres keep a cow and a horse?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",105
"106","—He can scarcely keep a cow and a horse, but some keep two cows and two ponies. But the very lowest cannot keep a cow and a horse, only a cow. He will pay about £3, holding five acres and a cow.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",106
"107","18481. But this cow or these cows and ponies have outrun; you have some hill pasture, although not much?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",107
"108","—Those who are farthest from it have no outrun at all. It is a long distance, and it is so small that our",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",108
"109","cows cannot travel to it.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",109
"110","18482. The hill pasture is all in one block at one end of the village; is that it?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",110
"111","—Yes, the hill pasture goes right across to the sea; it is at one end of the village.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",111
"112","18483. Then it is more available to crofters who live at one end of the village than to those at the other?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",112
"113","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",113
"114","18484. And the distance is too far for your cows to travel?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",114
"115","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",115
"116","18485. How far would it be to the farthest extent?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",116
"117","—Fully two miles. ",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",117
"118","18486. What have you got yourself in the way of stock?-",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",118
"119","—I keep two cows. ",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",119
"120","184S7. And how many acres of ground have you?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",120
"121","—About six or seven. ",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",121
"122","18488. And do your cows go to the hill pasture?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",122
"123","—No, I feed them on straw in winter, and in the summer time they feed round the farm; and the poorest soil I lay down in grass for them —soil which cannot be wrought for any kind of grain.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",123
"124","18489. You don't let them into the fields you cultivate?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",124
"125","—No.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",125
"126","18490. If they are not in the fields you cultivate, they must be outside?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",126
"127","—Yes, with a band on them.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",127
"128","18491. On whose land?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",128
"129","—They feed on the property for which I pay —on what we don't lay down in crop, and where grass is growing; there are bits of shallow, rocky ground which don't grow oats.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",129
"130","18492. You don't include that in the six or seven acres of arable ground?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",130
"131","—Yes, I think it will be about that altogether.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",131
"132","18493. That is within the cultivated area, and you prevent them from trespassing on the crop by a tether? ",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",132
"133","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",133
"134","18494. And the land beside the cultivated bit of ground belongs to another?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",134
"135","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",135
"136","18495. There is no common grass beside your croft ?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",136
"137","—No.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",137
"138","18496. What do you pay for the land?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",138
"139","—£4, 19s.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",139
"140","18497. Was your rent raised at the time the rest were raised?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",140
"141","—Yes, all at the same time.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",141
"142","18498. Was any reason given for raising the rents?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",142
"143","—No, nothing; they just brought a letter at Whitsunday, stating we had to be prepared to pay such rents as might be demanded of us at Martinmas, and then we got a note of what our rents were to be.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",143
"144","18499. That was twelve years ago?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",144
"145","—Ten or twelve years ago.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",145
"146","18500. Did the crofters remonstrate at the time against this raising of the rents?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",146
"147","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",147
"148","18501. And was any answer or reason given in reply?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",148
"149","—No; when the paper came out that we were to fish to him from that time in all time forward, and he would give a reduction, I did not sign it, and therefore I had no reason given.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",149
"150","18502. Do you think it was in order to get this advantage for the fishing?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",150
"151","—I could not tell.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",151
"152","18503. All you know is that the rent was raised?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",152
"153","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",153
"154","18504. Do you fish yourself much?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",154
"155","—Yes, I fish in the fishing season.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",155
"156","18505. How long does it last?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",156
"157","—It commences in March, and ends in the latter part of September.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",157
"158","18506. It is the cod and ling fishing?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",158
"159","—Yes, and the herring fishing too.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",159
"160","18507. What kind of fishing is most renumerative?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",160
"161","—The herring fishing, if it is anything good.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",161
"162","18508. How long does it last?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",162
"163","—Three and a half months. From the first of June to the latter end of September.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",163
"164","18509. Has the herring fishing improved of late years?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",164
"165","—Oh, yes, materially; from the time the Scotch curers came down and offered anything like a price, men have been able to get big boats, and it has improved a great deal. But before, we got no price; the landlords gave nothing of a price, only 7s. per stone or 10s. a cran or higher; in rare years they might go the length of 12s. or 13s.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",165
"166","18510. Did you always sell the fish to whomsoever you liked?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",166
"167","—Yes; some time ago, thirty years perhaps, or over that, our fathers were bound to fish to the proprietor, and then some of them stopped it, and would not be bound at the low prices, and then the proprietor made them pay what he called fish profits. When there were two men in one house he made them pay £1 , and where there was one man in a house 15s.; and then they got fishing to any man they chose.[see Appendix A. XLIX]",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",167
"168","18511. What is the school rate in your parish?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",168
"169","—I could not exactly say.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",169
"170","18512. What do you pay yourself; what does it come to in the pound?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",170
"171","—I think I pay 12s. or 14s. altogether in addition to the rent; the proprietor takes it in, and puts on the poor rate and school rate on the rent.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",171
"172","18513. A little above 3s. in the pound?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",172
"173","—Something thereabout.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",173
"174","18514. When you talked of your rent, did you include the rates in your rent?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",174
"175","—No, the bare rent.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",175
"176","18515. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",176
"177","—You say that the proprietor has wanted three days' work for each merk of land, that is a day for each",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",177
"178","merk; what kind of work is it you have to do?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",178
"179","—Agricultural labour; working on the farm generally.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",179
"180","18516. Do you get anything for that?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",180
"181","—No; and if we don't give the days' work, at Martinmas he charges 2s. for each day we don't work. If",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",181
"182","I work two days' work in the year he charges 2s.; if I work only one day, he charges 4s.; and if I don't work any of the three days, he charges 6s.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",182
"183","18517. How much was your own rent raised at the time you speak of, ten or twelve years ago? It is now £4, 19s., what was it before?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",183
"184","—£3, Is. 6d.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",184
"185","18518. Did you get no advantage whatever from the proprietor when the rent was raised to the present sum?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",185
"186","—Nothing whatever.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",186
"187","18519. You told us a good part of a hill was taken away from you at first: who has got the part of the hill that has never been given back to the people?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",187
"188","—The proprietor keeps it as a sheep farm for himself.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",188
"189","18520. You have stated that the piece which was given back to you is not convenient for yourself personally; was any part of that hill suitable for you?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",189
"190","—Yes, it lay much nearer my tenancy than what we have at the present time.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",190
"191","18521. Did the proprietor give any reason for taking away the whole of the hill pasture from you ?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",191
"192","—No.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",192
"193","18522. When the hill was taken from you, and he took your cattle, was it a favour for him to buy them, or would you rather have sold them yourselves?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",193
"194","—We would rather have sold them ourselves.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",194
"195","18523. And he not only wanted to have your land, but he wanted also to take your cattle at his own price?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",195
"196","—They were called into a public sale, and if any person bought them, the money had all to go through his hands.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",196
"197","18524. Was the township in arrears when this happened?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",197
"198","—No, it was in arrears before, but they were wrought out mostly.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",198
"199","18525. Was this £20 you speak of that was charged against you for removing the wire actually paid?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",199
"200","—Yes, it was actually paid.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",200
"201","18526. You said that you had received a notice that the increase of rent was to be put upon you at next Martinmas; when did you get notice of what the exact sum would be; I think you mentioned you got notice by letter of what it was to be?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",201
"202","—Yes, but I could not exactly tell you what date it would be.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",202
"203","18527. Was it some time after the term of Whitsunday?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",203
"204","—Yes, we first got notice to be prepared to pay the rent, and then we got notice what it was to be.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",204
"205","1S528. And that increased rent was to be paid at the first term?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",205
"206","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",206
"207","18529. You did not agree to fish for the proprietor ?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",207
"208","—No, I did not sign that paper, and got no reduction of rent. I did not bind myself to fish to him, or make myself a servant to any man for a lifetime. ",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",208
"209","18530. And you are paying the high rent?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",209
"210","—Yes. ",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",210
"211","18531. Is there any body else paying it that you know?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",211
"212","—Yes. ",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",212
"213","18532. They rather pay it than become bound to work?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",213
"214","—Not the old rent; they got a little reduction, something betwixt the old rent and the first rent, but not so low as the old rent.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",214
"215","18533. When you had the whole hill?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",215
"216","—Yes, we had the whole hill at the time.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",216
"217","18534. How is it working with regard to the other people who are fishing for him?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",217
"218","—He has never started a fishing station yet; but they bound themselves, if he wished to take a station, to fish to him.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",218
"219","18535. You are all fishing as you like?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",219
"220","—Yes, at the present time.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",220
"221","18536. Was not that system, wanting you to fish for him, going back to the worst kind of truck?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",221
"222","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",222
"223","18537. That is why you objected to it?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",223
"224","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",224
"225","18538. It was not for the benefit of yourself and other crofters that this was going on?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",225
"226","—No, it was not. If we fished to him, we would have to take what prices he liked to give us; and he would give us no notice of what the price was to be until Martinmas, when we came to settle, and we would have to take whatever prices he would give.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",226
"227","18539. Who is this proprietor; has he long been proprietor?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",227
"228","—It is about twenty years since he got the lease from his father. His father is living, and he got it from his father about twelve or twenty years ago.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",228
"229","18540. Is he not laird or proprietor?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",229
"230","—He is there, but his father is still living, and he is leasing under his father.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",230
"231","18541. Have the family been long proprietors?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",231
"232","—Oh, yes; I could not say when they came to be proprietors.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",232
"233","18542. Was something attempted to be done to any other of the tenants of Sumburgh except yourselves?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",233
"234","—At Dunrossness, they had to fish for him when he got the lease from his father, and they are fishing",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",234
"235","for him yet. He has another place in Sandwick parish, but he did not ask them to fish much for him.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",235
"236","18543. It is not fishing for his own family or table; he sells them?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",236
"237","—No, it is for fishing in the way of making a profit out of it, in the way of business.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",237
"238","18544. Do the people in the townships feel very sore about this matter?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",238
"239","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",239
"240","18545. And that is the reason they had the meeting to delegate you and Mr Clark to come here?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",240
"241","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",241
"242","18546. Is there any such thing going on in other parts of Shetland?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",242
"243","—I cannot tell. I don't travel much about. I should say every part is much the same.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",243
"244","18547. There are similar things in other parts?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",244
"245","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",245
"246","18548. Are the fishermen generally about here much in debt to the fish-curers and merchants?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",246
"247","—Some, buying big boats, had to get advances, and some of them have not got their boats cleared; but some of them are not due much.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",247
"248","18549. Are you in debt yourself to any fish-curer?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",248
"249","—No, I am not; but I have no share of a boat, I work on the half-catch system; if I had to go into a share of a boat, I would have to be a good deal in debt.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",249
"250","18550. Supposing a man is dealing with a fish-curer, and that he is in his debt and gets money upon credit; and supposing there is another man who works for the same person, who is not in debt, will the fish-curer sell. his goods cheaper to the mau who pays ready money than to the other?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",250
"251","—Yes, generally it will be from perhaps three to ten per cent, dearer if you come and go into the merchant's shop, and mark the goods until Martinmas; it will be dearer than to the man who pays ready in one.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",251
"252","18551. Have you known it as high as ten per cunt.?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",252
"253","—Perhaps not ten, but from three to five per cent.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",253
"254","18552. Five per cent, is not very much; it is the common discount on many things?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",254
"255","—No.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",255
"256","18553. Do you say it does not exceed more than five per cent.?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",256
"257","—I don't know exactly, because I never had much, I have dealt a little that way, but never a great deal. I always deal on the ready money system.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",257
"258","18554. In speaking to other people in that position, have you heard them saying of what they have been obliged to pay when getting goods on credit ?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",258
"259","—Yes, I have always heard that it was a good bit dearer than ready money.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",259
"260","18555. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",260
"261","—Does the landlord prevent the merchants from establishing shops on the property?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",261
"262","—He did once, but there have not been many shops established lately. I don't think he would prevent it so much now; but once he did prevent it.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",262
"263","18556. But that is done away with now?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",263
"264","—Yes, to a great extent.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",264
"265","18557. You have no difficulty in finding merchants within reach of you?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",265
"266","—No.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",266
"267","18558. Professor Mackinnon.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",267
"268","—You say you fish on the half-catch system. What is that system?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",268
"269","—Getting one half of what is caught, as a shareholder in the boat —one half of the produce of the boat. We would gross £100, and £50 would go to hold up the boat and gear, and £50 would be divided amongst us for prosecuting the fishing.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",269
"270","18559. The boat belongs to the fish-curer?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",270
"271","—The boat I go on does not; but there are fish-curers who have boats in the same way.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",271
"272","18560. They lend the boat and gear, and keep them in good order and they get half the value of the fish?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",272
"273","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",273
"274","18561. And the crew get the other half?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",274
"275","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",275
"276","18562. Is the boat you work in at the herring fishing or at the cod and ling?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",276
"277","—All together.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",277
"278","18563. Is it a large boat?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",278
"279","—Forty-four feet keel.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",279
"280","18564. When the curer advances money to a crew to buy a boat of that kind, what is the exact nature of the arrangement between them with respect to paying back the money?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",280
"281","—The general way of paying it back is that he gets the one half of the fish to go to the debt of the boat until it is paid up, and, according as his men and he arrange, a little interest is taken on the balance—from three to five or eight per cent, as they arrange about it",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",281
"282","18565. And whose is the boat meanwhile?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",282
"283","—The boat is held by the fisherman.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",283
"284","18566. From the day he takes possession?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",284
"285","—Yes, until he clears her.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",285
"286","18567. Do they insure these large new boats?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",286
"287","—Some of them do.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",287
"288","18568. The fishing has been very successful this year?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",288
"289","—No, it has almost failed this year as yet.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",289
"290","18569. But there is a great deal of the fishing season before you?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",290
"291","—Yes, the most important part is still to come.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",291
"292","18570. There is a large number of Isle of Man boats in the harbour here?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",292
"293","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",293
"294","18571. They are larger than yours?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",294
"295","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",295
"296","18572. Are they better?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",296
"297","—There is more accommodation for the men lying away from home, but our boats lying near our homes, are as good for us.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",297
"298","18573. They suit the Isle of Man people better because they can live in the boats?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",298
"299","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",299
"300","18574. How long have you been paying rent yourself for your croft ?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",300
"301","—For twenty years.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",301
"302","18575. What was your rent when you began to pay ?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",302
"303","—£3, Is. 6 d ",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",303
"304","18576. I think you said that twenty-five years ago the rent was smaller, when the people were obliged to fish for the proprietor?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",304
"305","—Yes. ",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",305
"306","18577. And when the proprietor lost that privilege, he charged them a sum of money which virtually made a rise of rent?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",306
"307","—Yes, he called it his fish profit, and, somehow or other he could not keep up that charge, and then he made up the rent.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",307
"308","18578. And then he raised the rent from £3 , Is. 6d. to £4 , 19s.?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",308
"309","—Yes, and a few years after that he took our scathold from us.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",309
"310","18579. The hill pasture; and afterwards a bit was restored?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",310
"311","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",311
"312","18580. About the wire fence for which you paid £20—who made the charge?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",312
"313","—The proprietor. The proprietor said it would cost £20 to move it, —to put the wire down. After long debate with him —we could not do without some part of the hill.—he said he would give us this back if we would pay £20 for shifting the wire.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",313
"314","18581. You say you are prohibited from taking soil out of the hilll; do you consider that a grievance?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",314
"315","—Yes, that is a great disadvantage.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",315
"316","18582. Were you not aware that it was injuring the pasture very much?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",316
"317","—Well, to some little extent it might, but there was plenty depth of ground left on it. We were leaving plenty depth of earth.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",317
"318","18583. You think it was not injuring the pasture so much as it was improving the tillage of the croft?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",318
"319","—No; and where we were taking that turf off it is all grown over now with grass the same as it was before. You would scarcely know it had ever been taken off.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",319
"320","18584. Are you prevented taking it off the small bit of hill pasture which remains with you?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",320
"321","—Yes, to some extent he is stopping us taking it off. An officer was on the property some few weeks ago asking who had been cutting it off, and they would not inform one on another, and said they could all be fined; and they are now fearing they will have a fine to pay for taking it off at the coming Martinmas.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",321
"322","18585. In addition to this rent of £4, 19s. you have three days' labour for each merk of land?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",322

"327","—I have three.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",327

"331","—About two acres.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",331
"332","18590. That is an old custom in the country?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",332
"333","—Yes, I believe an old Danish system of keeping up the measure of land.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",333
"334","18591. What you call scathold is what we call hill pasture, at the back of the turf dyke ?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",334

"337","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",337
"338","18593. After the harvest work of the croft is done what do people do in winter and early spring?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",338
"339","—Generally the fishermen are mending nets and preparing for fishing, and we have to bring the peats from the hills on our backs.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",339
"340","18594. You have ponies?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",340
"341","—I have none, and many more are like me. If you go through the country you will see little baskets of straw, and we go to the hill with these for our fuel. And, if it is a fine day, we may go out along the shores fishing with the small boat for haddocks. The name for the deep sea fishing is the haaf.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",341
"342","18595. What is shore fishing called?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",342
"343","—Generally going with haddock or hand lines; and when a heavy gale throws sea-weed ashore, we gather it for manure; and with that and procuring fuel, we are always busy.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",343
"344","18596. You settle beforehand the price of the fish with the curer at the commencement of the season?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",344
"345","—Yes, with the Scotch carers we always know the prices before we start.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",345
"346","18597. And is it with Scotch curers you work?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",346
"347","—Yes, but with the Shetland curers we generally never know the price until we come to settle.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",347
"348","18598. Supposing you didn't know the price of the fish, and that you were drawing from him, all the while, goods for the support of your family, do you also know the price of the goods?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",348
"349","—Always.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",349

"357","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",357

"359","—With a few it is, and with a lot it is not.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",359
"360","18604. And which is oftenest?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",360
"361","—It is as often against the fishermen as with him.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",361
"362","18605. Taking one year with another?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",362

"373","—Twelve or thirteen or fourteen years of age.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",373
"374","18611. Do the School Board allow them to be employed at twelve?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",374
"375","—No; but before the School Board was they were, and even fully as early as twelve; necessity bound many of them to go and work for themselves then.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",375
"376","18612. How do the Isle of Man fishermen cure their fish —in their own boats?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",376
"377","—No, I think they are fishing to curers here. Their boats are too small for curing on the boats.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",377
"378","18613. But they carry a large number of nets?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",378
"379","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",379
"380","18614. You say your proprietor on one part of his property has still people under contract to fish for him?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",380
"381","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",381
"382","18615. Are there other proprietors who still act on the same principle?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",382
"383","—I could not say.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",383
"384","18616. Can you tell me if there are any Shetland curers who have tenants under themselves, who pay rent for their croft, and who are bound to go and fish to him?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",384
"385","—This same proprietor at Dunrossness has tenants paying for their crofts, and who are bound to fish to him.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",385
"386","18617. But do you know if there is any curer in the country who rents land and sublets it to crofters who pay him for their crofts, and who are also bound to fish for him?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",386
"387","—No, I know of none of that description now.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",387
"388","18618. There used to be?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",388
"389","—Yes, there was, but I know of none now.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",389
"390","18619. I understand you to say you don't know, except your own proprietor, whether there are other proprietors who have people fishing for them ?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",390
"391","—There might be in the north, but there are not so far as I am aware, in the south, any proprietors whose tenants are bound to fish for them, except Bruce at Dunrossness.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",391
"392","18620. And he has not established a curing station in your portion of his estate?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",392
"393","—No.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",393
"394","18621. But he has some of his people bound to fish to him, if he choose?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",394
"395","—Yes. ",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",395
"396","18622. There are many like yourself not bound?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",396
"397","—Yes, but the great majority bound themselves. ",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",397
"398","18623. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",398
"399","—Was it you who spoke out?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",399
"400","—No, some the men, at the time south, were sailing, and some at the same time as I didn't do it.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",400
"401","18624. Professor Mackinnon.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",401
"402","—Were you the only one at home who would not pay?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",402
"403","—No, there were one or two besides myself.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",403
"404","18625. And your rent was not reduced?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",404
"405","—No.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",405
"406","18626. And were the rents of the others reduced?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",406
"407","—Some five and some ten per cent.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",407
"408","18627. Sheriff Nicolson.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",408
"409","—What price did you get last year for cod and ling?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",409
"410","—8s. 6d. for ling, and 7s. 6d. for cod, and 5s. 6d. for tusk.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",410
"411","18628. For what quantity?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",411
"412","—By the hundredweight.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",412
"413","18629. Has the price risen very much within the last twenty or thirty years, or has it remained much the same?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",413
"414","—It has risen a little within the last twenty years, but before that it was as high as what it is now almost. Before that, about forty years ago, it was pretty nearly as high as it is now. It got much lower twenty or thirty years ago. It was then as low as 4s. 6d. a cwt.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",414
"415","18630. Was that because the take of fish was so great?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",415
"416","—No, the merchants said the price was so low south, where the fish were sold, that they could pay no more. But it has increased from that up till last year, when it was 8s. 6d. a cwt.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",416
"417","18631. Professor Mackinnon.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",417
"418","—I suppose you know the southern markets now better than you did twenty years ago?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",418
"419","—Oh, yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",419
"420","18632. Sheriff Nicolson.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",420
"421","—At what time of the year is the price of the fish fixed?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",421
"422","—At Martinmas, generally, we settle. Some curers may make an offer in spring when they commence to fish, but, as a general rule, it is only when you come to settle that the curer tells you. Perhaps he says that is all he can afford to give; but it has lately been more prevalent to know the price of the fish when several boats come down. They won't fish without knowing the prices, and the curers who employ them have to fix the prices. But before that, we could not get a price; we had to take what we could get when the fishing was finished. We didn't know what we were fishing for until it was got.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",422
"423","18633. Was it the custom in your part of the country when fish were being dried to get the people to spread them out?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",423
"424","—A man undertakes to cure the fish for so much a ton, to dry fish for the curer, and he can employ labourers to work, and he has to pay the labourers",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",424
"425","18634. The Chairman.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",425
"426","—You told us the proprietor made you pay £20 for shifting a wire fence. Is the wire fence now put round the arable ground of the crofters or round the hill pasture?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",426
"427","—Round the hill pasture.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",427
"428","18635. Is it useful to the crofters where it now is?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",428
"429","—No, it is of no use, because he has occupied it and the bit he left is of little benefit, because it is the worst of the hill.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",429
"430","18636. But is the wire fence round the small piece you have?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",430
"431","—No, there is no wire fence round it, and we had to pay for removing it.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",431
"432","18637. What has he done with it?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",432
"433","—Put it upon the new enclosure.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",433
"434","18638. The wire fence is of no use to you?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",434
"435","—No, it is a great entrapment, because it is not sufficient to keep out our old Shetland sheep, and every time he catches our sheep we have to pay for them.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",435
"436","18639. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",436
"437","—It is good enough for the big sheep?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",437
"438","—Sometimes a few of them will come through, but not often. Every time he catches our sheep inside we have to pay 6d. a head for them.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",438
"439","18640. The Chairman.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",439
"440","—If there were no fences their sheep would go still more frequently in upon his land?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",440
"441","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",441
"442","18641. What can you sell off your croft; are you able to sell an occasional stirk?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",442
"443","—I can sell nothing unless an old cow, and then I have to buy a young one for it.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",443
"444","18642. But if you have two cows, can you not raise a young one yourself?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",444
"445","—Sometimes, and sometimes I must cut off the old one when I am bringing up the young one.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",445
"446","18643. Do you never sell a calf or stirk?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",446
"447","—Very rarely.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",447
"448","18644. If you sell a stirk how much do you get for it?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",448
"449","—-Generally £1 for every year of their age—£2 for a two-year-old, and so on.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",449
"450","18645. Do your neighbours not get more than £2 for a stirk one year old ?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",450
"451","—They never get £2; they may get a little over £1 if they are a little fatter or leaner, but never over £2.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",451
"452","18646. When you buy a cow how much do you pay?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",452
"453","—£6 or £7—say from £5 to £8—the prices vary.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",453
"454","18647. When you sell a cow how much do you get?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",454
"455","—From £3 to £5; very seldom below £3 .",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",455
"456","18648. Mr Fraser Mackintosh.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",456
"457","—Is the proprietor in the habit of exacting the sheep money from you?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",457
"458","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",458
"459","18649. The money is paid before the sheep are let out?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",459
"460","—Yes, I have no sheep to pay for; but the tenants have to pay.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",460
"461","18650. Is that going on every year?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",461
"462","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",462
"463","18651. You say that the labour you were obliged to give was for agricultural work to the proprietor?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",463
"464","—Yes.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",464
"465","18652. Has the proprietor no agricultural labourers of his own?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",465
"466","—Yes, he keeps a ploughman there regularly working, but we have to do and work three days' work for him.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",466
"467","18653. The Chairman.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",467
"468","—When you come to work for him the three days' labour do you get food?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",468
"469","—Yes, we get breakfast and dinner.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",469
"470","18654. Mr Cameron.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",470
"471","—But you can compound that for days' wages?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",471
"472","—Yes, he charges 2s. per day.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",472
"473","18655. Professor Mackinnon.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",473
"474","—If you work more than three days you get 2s. for the odd days?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",474
"475","—I do not think he would take us to work odd days. I never went except three days.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",475
"476","18656. What is a day's wage in the place?",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",476
"477","—I could not say —2s. to 2s. 6d.",339,"Laurence Jarmson","Shetland, Lerwick",477
