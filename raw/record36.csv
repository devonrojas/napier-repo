"70","—I think we would. ",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",70
"71","2219. Do you think £6, 7s. 6d. too high for 6 or 7 acres, with the right of grazing two cows ? ",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",71
"72","—What is the use of that when the grazing is not grazing, and when the land will not give crop ? ",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",72

"82","—We don't ask it of him. ",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",82
"83","2225. And you are not getting it?",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",83
"84","—We don't ask it. ",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",84
"85","2226. Are you taking it ?",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",85
"86","—I never did so myself. ",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",86
"87","2227. Then why do they ask the right to cut it, if they never took the trouble to ask it ?",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",87
"88","—We think it would do us good to have the right. ",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",88

"99","—So far as I am aware. ",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",99
"100","2233. But they have generally paid their rent ?",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",100
"101","—No, it is only one man who paid the whole rent last year. ",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",101
"102","2234. Did any of them refuse to pay ?",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",102
"103","—I do not know. ",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",103

"105","—Have you anything more to state before you retire ?",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",105
"106","—-I do not think I have. ",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",106
"107","2236. Professor Mackinnon.",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",107
"108","—Is it the case that the croft which now is £8, 10s., with the present abatement, less the hill pasture, was formerly rented at £4, 13s.?",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",108
"109","—Yes, that is just the case. The croft was £4, 13s.; that would keep twenty sheep, and the twenty sheep were taken away, and we were charged £8, 10s. ",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",109
"110","2237. Sheriff Nicolson.",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",110

"117","2240. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",117
"118","—You say that the people are very poor, and the township is poor and almost every one in debt so far as you are aware. Are they going gradually down, and getting worse in their circumstances year by year ?",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",118
"119","—Yes. ",36,"Donald Beaton","Skye, Uig",119
