"1","JOHN GILLIES, Crofter and Fisherman, Fladda (50)—examined.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",1
"2","7783. The Chairman.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected by the people of that island of Fladda?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",3
"4","—Yes.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",4
"5","7784. Have you a statement to make on their part?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",5
"6","—They  are complaining, as others are, about the hardness of the land, and the  dearness of it. It is dear, it is bad, and there is little of it. They  are also wanting to speak about the channel between them and the island.  They come from the island to the school here, and the channel is not  wider than thirty yards at high tide. Sometimes the children are  starving waiting for the tide, when they cannot get over —when the men  are away from home.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",6
"7","7785. You mean coming back from school?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",7
"8","—Yes; but many days they cannot go to school at all.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",8
"9","7786. How wide is the channel at high water?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",9
"10","—Thirty yards, and it is dry at half tide.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",10
"11","7787. What remedy do you suggest for this?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",11
"12","—Either  to bridge the channel, or else to give us another place to live in,  from which our children could go to school in safety.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",12
"13","7788. Would it be easy to bridge the channel?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",13
"14","—It would not be difficult at all. There are plenty of materials—plenty of stones thereabout.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",14
"15","7789.  Would you propose to bridge the channel with a light iron suspension  bridge, or do you think of building a regular stone bridge?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",15
"16","—I think a suspension bridge would be easier made, with plenty of stones at each end.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",16
"17","7790. Are the sides of the land on each side steep and high, or is it low and flat?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",17
"18","—It is steep on the Raasay side, but it is a gradual slope on the island side.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",18
"19","7791. Would a causeway of stone between the two islands not do?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",19
"20","—Yes, but I think it would cost more than the bridge I allude to.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",20
"21","7792. Mr Cameron.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",21
"22","—Do many vessels pass through that channel?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",22
"23","—Boats pass through at high tide.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",23
"24","7793. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",24
"25","—How many souls are in the island?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",25
"26","—About fifty altogether.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",26
"27","7794. How many children?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",27
"28","—I have eight myself. I don't know how many the others have.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",28
"29","7795. Have you as many as all the others put together?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",29
"30","—Another man has got quite as many as I have.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",30
"31","7796. Did you ask the proprietor to do anything for you about the bridge?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",31
"32","—No,  we did not give him a trial at all. Though the rent is high, Mr Wood is  not blamed for that; it was Mr Mackay, and Mr Wood simply left us as he  found us in regard to the rent.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",32
"33","7797. Professor Mackinnon.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",33
"34","—How many are there paying rent?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",34
"35","—Six.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",35
"36","7798. What is the rent each pays?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",36
"37","—The island altogether pays £30, and before Mr Mackay's time it was £22.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",37
"38","7799. What stock are you allowed to keep?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",38
"39","—Two cows and two young beasts —a stirk and a two-year-old.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",39
"40","7800. Sheep?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",40
"41","—I am not sure how many sheep the others have, but I have five. I don't think any one of us has more than seven.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",41
"42","7801. You are allowed to keep six?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",42
"43","—Yes.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",43
"44","7802. Do you fish?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",44
"45","—We work at every work that comes in the way.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",45
"46","7803. What fishing do you get off the island?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",46
"47","—The only fish we get about our own shores are eels.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",47
"48","7804. You don't fish for cod and ling?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",48
"49","—Yes, but it is not good fishing ground for ling. The ground is too foul, too deep. If we get anything",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",49
"50","at that depth it is skate.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",50
"51","7805. Where do you go for the fishing? Is it to the east coast?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",51
"52","—I  was not there for the past three years. I was staying at home working  for Mr Wood, but I have been eighteen seasons at the east coast fishing.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",52
"53","7806. Are there many of the people from your place working with Mr Wood as well as yourself?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",53
"54","—No, they work a little about this time of the year, just to get sufficient money to take them away to the fishing.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",54
"55","7807. Then is it your complaint that the crofts are too highly rented ?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",55
"56","—Yes.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",56
"57","7808. The old rent was not too high, was it?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",57
"58","—It  was high enough. It is too high now, but we never complained to Mr Wood  about it. We don't know what he might do if we complained to him. He is  a kind man. If all the island landlords were like him, a man might have  remained at home.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",58
"59","7809. I suppose in a bad year, with a good excuse, he would not be hard on you with the rent?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",59
"60","—No ; I sowed last year four barrels of oats, and I did not reap as much as would sow it back.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",60
"61","7810. That was a bad year. Do you ever change the seed?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",61
"62","—Yes.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",62
"63","7811. Where do you get the change of seed from?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",63
"64","—From Mr Wood's manager I got it last.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",64
"65","7812. How many returns of oats and potatoes do you get in a fair year?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",65
"66","—I might get three returns.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",66
"67","7813. Is that all you get in a good year?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",67
"68","—In a good year I might get three. Our ground is peat altogether.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",68
"69","7814. Then if you got the bridge you want, and the old rent, would that exhaust all your complaints? ",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",69
"70","— I think it would. It would take away a good share of our complaints, at any rate. ",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",70
"71","7815. Do you get steady work?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",71
"72","—Yes, and 13s. a week of wages. ",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",72
"73","7816. Would the other men who go to make money at the fishing get steady work if they remained ?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",73
"74","—Yes,  but they expect to make three times as much as that per week at the  fishing. Some nights I made £8, and other nights I made nothing at all,  at the east coast fishing.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",74
"75","7817. But you think, upon the whole, that 13s. a week and steady work is better?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",75
"76","—No,  I think the fishing is better. When I pay 2s. for lodgings off that  13s. and also my personal expenses for the week, my family would be  starving at home.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",76
"77","7818. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",77
"78","—What is the nearest place to the people of Torrin here where they could get work?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",78
"79","—Twelve miles from here.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",79
"80","7819. And there is no place nearer?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",80
"81","—No.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",81
"82","7820.  The previous witness stated that there is a farm steading about two  miles from here belonging to the proprietor. What place is that ?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",82
"83","—A  few of those living near the square may get work there—the Ballahouran  people; but it is up at Mr Wood's own house that the most of the work is  to be got.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",83
"84","7821. Mr Cameron.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",84
"85","—Is the pasture upon the island good or bad?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",85
"86","—It is bad. You would not think it would keep four sheep altogether.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",86
"87","7822. Sheriff Nicolson.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",87
"88","—Are there any shellfish on any of the beaches round Fladda?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",88
"89","—No, nothing but limpets and a few whelks.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",89
"90","7823. Do you make a trade of the whelks?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",90
"91","—Yes, some women work at them.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",91
"92","7824. What do you get per bushel for them?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",92
"93","—Sometimes Is. 6d. and sometimes 2s. 6d. a bushel; sometimes 20d.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",93
"94","7825. How long does it take to collect a bushel?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",94
"95","—Two days a bushel, at any rate, and sometimes three.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",95
"96","7826. The Chairman.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",96
"97","—How are you off for sea-ware on this shore? ",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",97
"98","—Our  sea-ware is out on rocks about our own shores. We have a pretty  sufficient quantity of peat, but we have to take it ashore with boats,  and then carry it on our backs to the ground.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",98
"99","7827. Do you pay anything for it ?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",99
"100","—No, we don't pay for it.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",100
"101","7828. Arc there any horses ?",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",101
"102","— No horses ; they would be drowned.",147,"John Gillies","Raasay, Torran",102
