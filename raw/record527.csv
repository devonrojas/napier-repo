"2","31272. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",2
"3","—How many cottars are there in Bundaloch?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",3
"4","—Thirty-four families. ",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",4
"5","31273. Does that include Carndhu ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",5
"6","— Yes. Macrae",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",6
"7","31274. [To John Macrae]. ",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",7
"8","—Are you one of these thirty-four ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",8
"9","—I am.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",9
"10","31275. But Farquhar Macrae is not ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",10
"11","—No.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",11
"12","31276. What have you to say on behalf of these people?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",12
"13","—I have not much to say, but I have been left destitute as well as my father, who was paying rent before my day. I was the head of the family after my father died. My sheep were taken from me for a trifle, and the whole of the people were treated in the same way. We have been robbed. The proprietor did not wait to see what we might be able to do. We are told that the proprietor declares we were largely in arrears of rent; but the arrears were not so large as represented. Many of these arrears were two hundred years old, lying always in the book, handed over from one proprietor to another. Another thing is, they wished to get hold of our receipts, and when they did they were burned and rent books given instead. Then they renewed the arrears against us for which they had receipts, after the receipts had been destroyed.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",13
"14","31277. I hope you will be cautious to say nothing you are not sure about ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",14
"15","—We have also been hearing that it was reported in the newspapers that the proprietor stated that he gave work to all his people, and that they were in no want whatever, and the destitution money which was being distributed here and there was in consequence of that statement kept from us. Some of us got a little timber, say to the value of 5s., and some to the value of 10s., to make up our boats. Another statement we complain of is, that they have been declaring we are no workers, and in con sequence they have refused us work, even to myself for one. All my potatoes were lost through the severe frost of last winter. I went to the authorities for assistance and wanted work on the road, which is in a disgraceful state between Bundaloch and Dornie, but I was refused. The reply I got from the factor was that, although myself and all I had should die of starvation I would get no work. This is our grievance. What we want is a little land to help us to live. After that we met with the factor at the schoolhouse, Dornie, but all he did was to make fun of us, telling us to take crops out of the rocks, and to imitate the earth worms who were splendid drainers. And further he told us that the blood went from the heart to the top of the head, and then went downwards to the soles of our feet. This signified that men now-a-days were asking too much, but that they would be checked. A vessel was sent to the country loaded with potatoes by the proprietor, but the factor went amongst the better class of people to give them a supply, and kept from the poorer classes all knowledge of it ; and had it not been for the parish minister, who through charity and kindness got a supply for us, we should have been in a very bad state indeed. Had it not been for the minister of Dornie, many of the poor people here would have been in danger of dying of want during the spring. The nuns provided them with work.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",15
"16","31278. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",16
"17","—Who is the factor you are referring to all along, is it Mr Watson ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",17
"18","—I have been referring to Mr Watson and Mr Maclean.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",18
"19","31279. Who was the factor that had the meeting with you when he laughed at you ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",19
"20","—They were both there, but it was Mr Maclean who was speaking.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",20
"21","31280. Is Mr Maclean the principal factor?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",21
"22","—Yes, he is.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",22
"23","31281. When you were deprived of your sheep, who got the land?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",23
"24","—Some Macmillans.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",24
"25","31282. Have they got it yet ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",25
"26","—No, not now.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",26
"27","31283. Who has it now?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",27
"28","—One John Macrae.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",28
"29","31284. Could you not have sold your own sheep at a public market instead, since the proprietor or incoming tenant was not bound to take the stock ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",29
"30","—No, we could not do that, because two of them sent their sheep to another grazing farm, and the factor threatened them unless they brought them back.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",30
"31","31285. Who got the benefit of the inadequate price of the sheep, —the factor or the incoming tenant ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",31
"32","—I suppose it was the two incoming tenants.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",32
"33","31286. What was the price you got for the stock ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",33

"35","31287. What stock of sheep do you suppose you had ? Had you some 500?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",35
"36","—Something like 450 sheep.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",36
"37","31288. Had you your full summing ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",37
"38","—We had about that number, and in addition some of the poorer cottars among us had also extra beasts included.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",38
"39","31289. Who was the factor at the time the sheep were taken from you ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",39
"40","—Mr Finlayson.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",40
"41","31290. And have the people been in poor condition ever since?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",41
"42","—Exceedingly poor.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",42
"43","31291. During this last year did your state become so serious that you were obliged to apply to the clergymen of the three denominations to write a letter on your behalf ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",43
"44","—Some of us were as poor as we could possibly be.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",44
"45","31292. Did the three clergymen agree to do so?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",45
"46","—They agreed most willingly, and we took their advice and conducted ourselves most peacefully and respectfully.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",46
"47","31293. Did these clergymen do so from their own knowledge of the circumstances?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",47
"48","—They knew from their own experience, and anybody might, passing the way, from their own knowledge. ",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",48
"49","31291. Can you give any reason why you were refused work when John Macrae there was work going?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",49
"50","—I don't know, as I never since then have gone to and seek work. I have been in the habit of going to the fishing and to the south country for work.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",50
"51","31295. Do you recollect the time of Sir Hugh ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",51
"52","—Very well.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",52
"53","31296. Was it the fact that he crowded in a great number of people into Bundaloch, Cairndhu, and Dornie, and only gave them a few acres of land ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",53
"54","—It is quite true he so gathered them in.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",54
"55","31297. You stated the arrears were two hundred years old, and were handed over from one proprietor to another. Is it not rather that the arrears were held over against the crofters and their possessions ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",55
"56","—I am quite certain that they were kept up for a space of two hundred years against the crofter or his representatives.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",56
"57","31298. Mr Cameron.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",57
"58","—When you say you were refused work on the road, did anybody else get work on that road ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",58
"59","—No; it is a disgrace yet for anybody to see that road, passing along.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",59
"60","31299. At the time you asked for employment on the road you were refused, and nobody else got any work on the road?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",60

"66","31302. Is it a road which was much used?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",66
"67","—It was very much injured by the great storm.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",67
"68","31303. Is there at the two points any population which use the road?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",68

"75","—I believe it is kept up by the proprietor himself.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",75
"76","31307. Do the people who use the road help to maintain it?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",76
"77","—No.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",77
"78","31308. When was the last repair effected on the road by anybody?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",78
"79","—Several years ago.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",79
"80","31309. You state that on one occasion the factor told you when you asked for employment that you and your family might die of starvation, but that you would get no work ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",80
"81","—I could swear to that.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",81
"82","31310. Was any one present when the factor made use of these words?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",82
"83","—Yes, plenty, but some of them are dead. The tenant of Lienessie was present and heard the words. He is still alive. Alexander M'Lennan was also present.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",83
"84","31311. How many years ago was it?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",84

"86","31312. But this about the road occurred at that time, and not in recent times?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",86
"87","—No, not recently; in the time of Mr Finlayson being factor.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",87

"93","—It was Mr Maclean.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",93
"94","31316. Are you sure the factor intended to make fun of you?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",94
"95","—It looked very like it. Can we take crops out of the rocks, or imitate the earth worm as a drainer ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",95
"96","31317. Do you as a a matter of fact know that the earth worm is a good drainer?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",96
"97","—He may be a good drainer for those who have land, but what is that to us who have no land. We paid 2s. 6d. for land to plant half a barrel of splits in.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",97
"98","31318. Have you any children ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",98

"103","—Had you land yourself in 1852?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",103
"104","—Yes. I was the head of the family after my father's death. When my father died my mother's brother, who was postman in Lochalsh, paid the rent for her until I became of age to do it myself, and when the land was taken from us there were only £ 3 of arrears against me, which I paid into the hands of Mr Finlayson, and I expected that I might be allowed to retain the house stones.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",104
"105","31321. Are you still occupying the same house since?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",105

"109","31323. As tenants?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",109
"110","—My great grandfather preached in the parish church of Lochalsh.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",110
"111","31324. And your ancestors always held land at the same place?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",111
"112","—They were in several places.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",112

"114","—Quite so.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",114

"118","—He was not.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",118
"119","3132S. What was the condition of the people of the township before the potato disease ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",119
"120","—They were fairly well off. They hadn't much land, but what they had they made good use of, and they did not require to go eighteen miles from home to plant potatoes, as we have to do.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",120
"121","31329. They lived upon the croft and fishing?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",121
"122","—Yes, they lived on both.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",122

"132","this he did not go near them.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",132
"133","31334. Hadn't the tenant anything to do with the appointment of the valuators ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",133
"134","—I don't know as to that. If he had such a right he was not aware of it. Finlayson frightened the people so much that they dared not do anything.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",134
"135","31335. Do you know that their right was not exercised by any one of them ? ",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",135

"145","31340. Do you remember that occurrence?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",145
"146","—I don't remember that altogether, but there is a man here who remembers it and can testify to it",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",146
"147","31341. Can you say that your receipts were taken from you and books and given in exchange, and that debts were marked against you for which you formerly held receipts?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",147
"148","—Yes; and one of the receipts was found amissing, and was given by the party who found it to the policeman to see what kind of document it was. The policeman said it was as good as money in the bank to him. ' Show me your book,' he said; and when the man did so what appeared upon the receipt to have been paid was against him as arrears in the book.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",148
"149","31342. Did he show that receipt to the factor?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",149
"150","—I don't think he did.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",150
"151","31343. He allowed the arrears to stand against him in the pass book?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",151
"152","—I believe he did.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",152
"153","31344. Although he had proof in his hand that it was not an arrear ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",153
"154","—Yes.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",154
"155","31345. [To Farquhar Macrae]. You have heard what John Macrae has said ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",155
"156","—Yes.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",156
"157","31346. I suppose you agree with all he has stated?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",157
"158","—Well, he said plenty that I don't know anything about, but so far as I know it is true.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",158
"159","31347. Do you know about this petition which Mr Morison wrote out ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",159

"161","31348. Have you any relations living among the cottars at Bundaloch?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",161
"162","—Yes, my mother is there and has a croft, but not the grazing of a cow.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",162
"163","31349. Was any other answer received to this petition but the answer which is given here ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",163
"164","—Not to my knowledge.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",164
"165","31350. Was the petition presented to Sir Alexander Matheson?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",165
"166","—It was presented to the factor.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",166
"167","31351. And did he afterwards deliver it?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",167
"168","—I don't know.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",168
"169","31352. Was any further communication made to the cottars at Bundaloch about this letter?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",169

"172","—He said that he did not forward the petition, but that he sent a letter to Sir Alexander Matheson.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",172
"173","31351. That is not the letter from the ministers, but a letter of his own ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",173
"174","—A letter of his own.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",174
"175","31355. Have you anything you wish to say further on behalf of Bundaloch ?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",175
"176","—There is one special grievance that has not been yet referred to, but which applies to other townships besides Bundaloch. If I want to make up my roof, I require to buy timber and make it up; but supposing I close the door and have to go from home on any business, the factor has the power to come and force the door in with his foot, if he sees proper, and dispossess me of any stones, and he may dispossess me before I am aware. I don't wish to add anything further to the statement. I have been in delicate health since last month, and could not write any statement, but coming across to-day I wrote a small statement upon the deer forest, and would like to read it.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",176
"177","31356. We presume the petition asks what you want?",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",177
"178","—Of course the petition to the proprietor of that time did.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",178
"179","31357. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",179
"180","—The petition is part of our business, and we will look into it, and you must not think although we do not put a question to you that we won't consider them.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",180
"181","—Statement by FARQUHAR MACRAE.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",181
"182","—The Linessie forest, which would cast 800 wedders anuually, and before 2000 slaughtered by butchers would average 721bs. per head, equal to 57,600 lbs. of mutton ; the Kilellan forest, which would cast 1000 wedders annually and would average 70 lbs per head equal to 70,000 lbs. of mutton ; also the Lochalsh Moor Forest, which would cast 800 wedders averaging 72 lbs., and equal to 57,600 lbs; also 200 ewes, which would average 60 lbs., equal 12,000, —making a total of 197,200 lbs. of mutton. I only point out these because Sir Alexander Matheson says that there is no harm in converting sheep walks into deer forests. But how do deer forests affect large centres, such as Glasgow, when a single estate could produce so much mutton? And how do deer forests affect the Government when all our kingdom's money will arrive at America for inferior flesh, instead of pure Highland mutton ? Now the wool that would grow on every one of the forests—Linassie forest, 16,200 lbs. of wool; Kilellan forest, 19,800 lbs.; Lochalsh forest, 48,000; —making a total 84,000 lbs. of wool. How do deer forests affect the low country farmer when upwards of £2000 sterling was left for wintering these forests' hoggs ? How do deer forests affect the traveller when he must not go his way through the forest ? And how do deer forests affect the working class when they must pay Is. per lbs. For mutton instead of 6d. per lbs. ? I hope reporters will bring this with them, as it will be found valuable if the inhabitants of towns and villages would understand it. I am able to prove that the Lochalsh forest is laboured by one gamekeeper, and when under sheep there were four shepherds, three wintering shepherds, and several helpers, besides clipping and smearing. And then how can any man tell me that there is as much labour attached to deer forests as sheep walks ? Now, if the people get the land, they will serve towns with beef and mutton, and supply themselves with the fat of the grass as in other days. But landlords today want nothing but a pursefull of money, and that makes them let their hill and glens under deer instead of brave and powerful men, who would rise shoulder to shoulder, to serve their queen and country if required. Oh, the deer! oh, the deer! Very backward regulations when the deer would be the ruler, and the sons of men starving without land to cultivate.",527,"John Macrae, Farquhar Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",182
