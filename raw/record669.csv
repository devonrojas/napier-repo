"6","1st, We had been deprived of the use of a large extent of hill pasture which was attached to our crofts, and on which each family had between twenty and thirty sheep. Now we possess none, the pasture being added to a neighbouring farm. ",669,"Alexander Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",6
"7","2nd, Our crofts are too small, though there is abundance of moorland in the locality fit for reclamation; but in the absence of a lease we have no encouragement to do so, as our rents would be raised on the termination of the lease of the nearest farm.
