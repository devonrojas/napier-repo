"9","4891. You wish to make a statement with reference to certain evidence ",89,"Kenneth Campbell","Skye, Broadford",9
"10","—To the evidence of Mr Logan and of the last witness. At the time they would require sea-ware here my uncle left for Oban, and he gave me permission to give the sea-ware to every one that would seek for it, but he preserved a wee patch that was near our own park for our own use and the use of cottars that we have on the place; and so I did give it to every one that came that way, and a fixed price on it, and that because the proprietor was doing the same. Well, I did not get one penny for the sea-weed as yet, and whether I will or not—I am not very particular—but we preserved a piece near our own park for our own use and the use of the cottars, as I have said. Mr Logan said that Mr Murchison objected to it; but I may state that they never asked it of Mr Murchison, nor said a word about it at all. This place was built for telling the truth, and not lies —I cannot give them another name. Well, there were three boats just landed at the piece we preserved for our own use, and I and the ground officer went down and asked them who gave them permission, and one of the men came up and said the two of us were too weak to have such language, and then I and the ground officer returned and left them there, and they did not say what brought them there or who gave them permission to cut sea-ware. That was all I said. ",89,"Kenneth Campbell","Skye, Broadford",10

"18","4896. How much would it weigh ?",89,"Kenneth Campbell","Skye, Broadford",18
"19","—Would it weigh as much as one ton ?",89,"Kenneth Campbell","Skye, Broadford",19

"21","4897. Sheriff Nicolson.",89,"Kenneth Campbell","Skye, Broadford",21
