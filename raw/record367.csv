"19","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",19
"20","20840. By far the largest property is the Busta estate?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",20
"21","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",21
"22","20841. Does the factor rent it himself, or doe3 he let it out?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",22
"23","—He lets it out.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",23
"24","20842. He just acts as factor?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",24
"25","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",25
"26","20843. What is the poor rate? ",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",26
"27","—3s. on the gross rental, and 4s. on the net rental.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",27
"28","20844. The school rate?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",28
"29","—2s. on the gross rental; but it will be 2s. 3d. this coming year.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",29
"30","20845. Are these rates decreasing or increasing?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",30
"31","—Rather increasing.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",31
"32","20846. The school rate is to be 2s. 3d. on the gross rental next year; will it attain its maximum then?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",32
"33","—We hope so.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",33
"34","20847. Is the parish well provided with schools now?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",34
"35","—Yes, we have five schools in the parish.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",35
"36","20848. Are all these schools erected since the Education Act came into operation?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",36
"37","—There was an old parochial school which has been renewed.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",37
"38","20849. And there are four others ?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",38
"39","—-Yes, one was handed over two or three years ago from the United Presbyterian Church at Ollaberry.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",39
"40","20850. Are these schools fairly taken advantage of by the people?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",40
"41","—Oh, yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",41
"42","20851. The children of to-day are receiving education in greater numbers than before the new Act came into operation?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",42
"43","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",43
"44","20852. But still, I suppose, they are not able to attend so regularly as  you would wish?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",44
"45","—Not so regularly as we would wish, but the officer does what he can to get them out.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",45
"46","20853. Do they attend as regularly as you think they could?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",46
"47","—No, I think not.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",47
"48","20854. Are they improving in that respect?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",48
"49","—They are improving since the schools were built.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",49
"50","20855. Of course, it will take some time?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",50
"51","—It will.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",51
"52","20856. Is the qualification of teachers under the new administration higher than it was for teachers under the old administration?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",52
"53","—I could scarcely say; the qualification is somewhat different.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",53
"54","20857. I don't refer to the parish school, but other schools in the parish; are teachers who have succeeded them of higher qualifications than their predecessors?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",54
"55","—Oh, yes, certainly they are.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",55
"56","20858. Of course, the buildings are better?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",56
"57","—Yes, the buildings are the best in the parish",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",57
"58","20859. I suppose there is no fish-curer in this place but your own firm?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",58
"59","—Yes, there is Mr Lawrence Smith, Mr Inkster, and Messrs Adie; and there used to be one Williamson, and Hay & Co., North Roe.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",59
"60","20860. I mean in Hills wick?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",60
"61","—There is nobody here but myself just now.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",61
"62","20861. And you cure the fish for all the people here?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",62
"63","—I don't cure for all the people. ",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",63
"64","20862. Whom do they get to cure for them?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",64
"65","—They have six other curers in the parish; at Stennes. Mr Inkster and Messrs Adie have each a station. ",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",65
"66","20863. You cure for all the people who bring their boats in here?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",66
"67","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",67
"68","20864. And of course you also provide them with stores?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",68
"69","—I buy the fish from them.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",69
"70","20865. And provide them with stores?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",70
"71","—Yes; but sometimes they get them at Lerwick.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",71
"72","20866. Have you communication with Lerwick?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",72
"73","—Yes; the 'St Clair' comes in here, and that has been a great boon for us.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",73
"74","20867. Are there any crofters upon the property you rent?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",74
"75","—No.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",75
"76","20868. It is in your own hands?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",76
"77","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",77
"78","20869. Is there as much sub-letting of property by tacksmen now as there used to be?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",78
"79","—I have the property at Ollaberry belonging to my brother; I sub-let that.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",79
"80","20870. Does your brother stay at Ollaberry?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",80
"81","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",81
"82","20871. And you rent it from him, and sub-let it?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",82
"83","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",83
"84","20872. Are your tenants fishing for you?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",84
"85","—Chiefly; but there are a good many otherwise engaged.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",85
"86","20873. And do those who are engaged in fishing fish for your firm?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",86
"87","—No, only some.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",87
"88","20874. Some fish for other people?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",88
"89","—Yes; they are quite at liberty to fish for whom they like.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",89
"90","20875. But when you cure yourselves, the most of them naturally come to you with their fish?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",90
"91","—Yes, I am glad to get as many of them as I can, as long as they are content.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",91
"92","20876. The chief fishing here is cod and ling?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",92
"93","—Ling fishing principally.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",93
"94","20877. It is a good station for that?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",94
"95","—Yes, it is a good station; but the fishing stations for ling used to be at Stennes, Hama Toe, and  Roeness Voe.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",95
"96","20878. And the herring fishing is a recent industry?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",96
"97","—This is the first year we have tried it at Hillswick.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",97
"98","20879. Where do you go for the herring?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",98
"99","—Mostly within the bay, and they have gone about fifty miles off, right into the ocean.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",99
"100","20880. There is scarcely any family at all without more or less land, I suppose?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",100
"101","—Not many. There may be a few individuals who have rooms.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",101
"102","20881. Of the natives of the place?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",102
"103","—Yes, who occupy rooms, without land.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",103
"104","20882. The crofters who have spoken to-day, spoke about the rents being somewhat high; do you think that the rents are too high upon the Busta estate?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",104
"105","—I scarcely think they are over-rented. So long as they have liberty of scathold, I think they may do. There may be individual. cases where the rents are too high.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",105
"106","20883. You mean where the rent is too high for the croft, but not for the croft with the scathold?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",106
"107","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",107
"108","20884. When there is common pasture, is every crofter entitled to put as much stock upon it as he pleases?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",108
"109","—Yes, that is true; but then they are necessarily restricted, because they can only put stock on in summer; they could not live in winter if everybody put on as many as they could.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",109
"110","20885. So that they are restricted by the number of stock they can keep in winter?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",110
"111","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",111
"112","20886. But I suppose they don't give any winter feeding to their sheep?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",112
"113","—Oh yes, they sometimes do; during snow they must either give them feeding, or lose them.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",113
"114","20887. But there is no rule where there is common pasture, that there is a summing, and that no crofter is allowed to put on the pasture more than a certain number of sheep and cattle?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",114
"115","—No.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",115
"116","20888. And the proprietor does not interfere at all?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",116
"117","—No, he has not interfered yet",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",117
"118","20889. So that the one who can buy stock can summer as many as he can keep?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",118
"119","—That is true.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",119
"120","20890. Take two neighbours—one who has capital and has put a good deal of stock upon the scathold, and another neighbour who has no stock to speak of, does the poor one not consider the possession of stock by the other a grievance?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",120
"121","—Yes, I have heard that said; I have heard a farmer of that kind express himself to that effect, that he thought it would be a good plan if the proprietor restricted everybody to so many cattle, or charged them for what they occupied.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",121
"122","20891. Make them pay?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",122
"123","—Yes, for each head.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",123
"124","20892. Those who had so many over a certain number?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",124
"125","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",125
"126","20893. Are the Shetland sheep still kept in large numbers in the parish for the purposes of the hosiery industry?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",126
"127","—Yes, in considerable numbers.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",127
"128","20894. And the wool which the women of the place knit is Shetland wool?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",128
"129","—Mostly; it is preferred by those who buy.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",129
"130","20895. And they get a good market for their goods?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",130
"131","—I think so.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",131
"132","20896. And a ready market?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",132
"133","—Yes, hitherto.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",133
"134","20897. We were told lately that Shetland gools were a drug in the market, more or less; is that your experience here?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",134
"135","—I don't think that is my experience; the refuse sort of stuff may be a drug in the market, but not the good hosiery.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",135
"136","20898. What kind of articles do they knit in this parish?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",136
"137","—In this district we only knit underclothing for ladies and gentleman—that is the chief branch of the trade here.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",137
"138","20899. No stockings or gloves?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",138
"139","—No.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",139
"140","20900. And there is quite a ready market for the goods?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",140
"141","—Yes, we have always found that.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",141
"142","20901. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",142
"143","—Are you in the habit of dealing with the people for hosiery?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",143
"144","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",144
"145","20902. Do you supply them with the wool?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",145
"146","—Sometimes we sell them the wool.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",146
"147","20903. Are you able to purchase Shetland wool for them?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",147
"148","—Sometimes we purchase it for them, in order to supply them when they have run out of their own.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",148
"149","20904. Do you sometimes supply them with Cheviot wool?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",149
"150","—No, we don't like to buy it for hosiery.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",150
"151","20905. You are able to procure a sufficient supply of Shetland wool?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",151
"152","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",152
"153","20906. What is the price of it?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",153
"154","—We pay Is. 5d. a pound for the fine wool.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",154
"155","20907. Does the colour make any difference?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",155
"156","—Yes, a little. We have to pay a little higher for the coloured wool,—dark and light brown —murrait wool.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",156
"157","20908. Have you any information as to what sort of profit a woman can make out of the hosiery business?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",157
"158","—I can scarcely say.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",158
"159","20909. I suppose they only devote their odd time to knitting and spinning? They don't sit down and spin day after day?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",159
"160","—-No, they do it while they are carrying peats and walking about the road.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",160
"161","20910. Are there any old women in the parish without other means of support, who are able to keep themselves by the hosiery trade?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",161
"162","—Yes, some of the women do. I don't know if they would be able to support themselves by their knitting; they may have some other way of supplementing it.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",162
"163","20911. Have you any idea what such people make in the course of the year by knitting and spinning?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",163
"164","—No, I cannot say. I heard one of the witnesses speak about the roads—that is a thing we are very much in need of. We have no roads from here all round to Asheness and Ollaberry to North Roe. And it would be a great favour to us if we had the telegraph.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",164
"165","20912. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",165
"166","—What is the nearest telegraph station?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",166
"167","—Voe, eighteen miles from here.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",167
"168","20913. Is there any telegraph station at Olaberry?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",168
"169","—No. When the telegraph was extended to the North Isles, and I spoke about extending it to Ollaberry and Hillswick, and we were told they would do it if we got up a guarantee of £50. I wrote to a good many people who, I thought, might be interested in it, and we got up a subscription of £60, and we were told it could not be done unless we got up £100.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",169
"170","20914. Who was it that told you that?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",170
"171","—I could not say.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",171
"172","20915. Was it an official of the post office?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",172
"173","—Yes, or the Telegraph Company, perhaps. I don't remember hi3 name.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",173
"174","20916. Professor Mackinnon.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",174
"175","—Was that before the telegraphs were taken over by Government?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",175
"176","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",176
"177","20917. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",177
"178","—You stated that the price of Shetland wool was Is. 5d. per lb., but that dark wool would be more; can you tell me the difference?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",178
"179","—I think about 2d. per lb.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",179
"180","20918. Is. 7d. ?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",180
"181","—Perhaps.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",181
"182","20919. Are there many Cheviot sheep in this parish?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",182
"183","—Yes; I have some on my property.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",183
"184","20920. And some blackfaced ?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",184
"185","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",185
"186","20921. But the bulk of the sheep stock is native?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",186
"187","—Yes; the bulk in the parish. Some of them may have been crossed, not to their advantage, I dare say, in regard to wool.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",187
"188","20922. The bulk of the stock being native in this parish, as the bulk of the stock at Balta Sound was Cheviot —would that account for the native wool being Is. 8d. and the black 2s. at Balta Sound?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",188
"189","—I suppose so.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",189
"190","20923. Does the 'St Clair' go all along the western coast of Scotland?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",190
"191","—No; she goes to Stromness, and then to Aberdeen and Leith.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",191
"192","20924. Would you explain why the poor rate seems so high in this parish; is it because the number of paupers is disproportionate to the rental, or what?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",192
"193","—The chief cause probably is the number of lunatics; that is the heaviest charge we have, I think.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",193
"194","20925. Are these lunatics boarded out in the south, or do you keep them in the parish?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",194
"195","—Some are boarded in the south, and others are kept at home.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",195
"196","20926. We were told at Mid Yell that the rate is very high there, and that it might be reduced considerably if the poorhouse test could be applied; is this parish one of those willing to go into a combination?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",196
"197","—I scarcely think i t; we believe that our paupers can be kept cheaper than by having a poorhouse.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",197
"198","20927. But do you think there are any on the roll now receiving relief who would not go into the poorhouse?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",198
"199","—I scarcely think it; members of the Parochial Board are so well acquainted with people in their different districts that they know their circumstances exactly.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",199
"200","20928. And probably a good number of the paupers are old people?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",200
"201","—Yes, a good many of them; but we would be the better of a poorhouse in the parish, where we could order the paupers home. We would be very much the better of that.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",201
"202","20929. Has any reason been assigned why lunacy is so prevalent in Shetland compared with other parts?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",202
"203","—I have not heard.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",203
"204","20930. One of the crofters' delegates complained of want of leases—are you aware that that is a general complaint?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",204
"205","—I have no reason to complain. I have a lease; but I think that want has generally been felt,",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",205
"206","20931. Do you think if the people had a lease of some kind they would be disposed to improve their croft?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",206
"207","—Yes, I think so.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",207
"208","20932. If you were a proprietor yourself you would not object to grant leases if the terms were fair?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",208
"209","—No, I think not. I offered to give leases to my Ollaberry tenants to the extent of my lease.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",209
"210","20933. And did they come to terms with you?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",210
"211","—Some of them did, and some of them did not seem to want it.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",211
"212","20934. What terms did you make with regard to the buildings, with those tenants to whom you granted leases?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",212
"213","—There is only one gentleman has a lease—Mr George Sinclair.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",213
"214","20935. What conditions did you propose with regard to the buildings?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",214
"215","—Well, I supposed he would be obliged to keep up the buildings.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",215
"216","20936. But supposing a house could not be repaired further in a lease of nineteen years, do you think the new house should be built by the proprietor or by the tenant?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",216
"217","—I think the proprietor should build it. ",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",217
"218","20937. That is the common way of doing in these islands?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",218
"219","—I think so. I think I heard one of-the witnesses say something about the prices of cattle. I think he was wrong in what he said; the price of cattle has been very high this year. I think I heard him mention £2 or £3 for young cattle. I buy cattle, and I have been paying from £3 to £5.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",219
"220","20938. What age?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",220
"221","—Two to three years old.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",221
"222","20939. They are bringing this year from £3 to £5?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",222
"223","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",223
"224","20940. Do you mean crofters' cattle?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",224
"225","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",225
"226","20941. You made use of the word refuse in speaking of Shetland wool?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",226
"227","—I did not mean the refuse of the wool, I meant inferior knitted hosiery—murat.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",227
"228","20942. Is that a Norse word?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",228
"229","—I cannot tell.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",229
"230","[Rev. Mr Sutherland. ",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",230
"231","—Yes, it is; it means a colour between brown and yellow.]",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",231
"232","20943. The Chairman.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",232
"233","—Is this brown wool more peculiar to some farms than to others? Does it depend at all on the soil upon which the sheep are raised?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",233
"234","—No.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",234
"235","20944. Would the native breed have it in the same degree?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",235
"236","—Yes, it is maybe more common in one place than another, because they may keep a murrait ram.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",236
"237","20945. Is it the pure native breed of cattle for which you pay £3 to £5?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",237
"238","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",238
"239","20946. Has any cross been introduced in this part of the country?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",239
"240","—Yes, we have some crosses here between shorthorn and Shetland, which makes a good cross.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",240
"241","20947. Is that cross used by the small tenants?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",241
"242","—No. We kept a shorthorn bull for some time, but they thought the cross breds would not be so hardy, and did not take advantage of it.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",242
"243","20948. But you think it might be extensively taken advantage of by the small tenants?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",243
"244","—I think not, because unless the animals are well fed, they don't turn out well.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",244
"245","20949. You stated that you were lessee of your brother's property, is it in that sense that you are a farmer, or have you actually land under your own management and cultivation?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",245
"246","—I have land under my own management besides,—here at Hillswick.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",246
"247","20950. And you have also your brother's property, which you sub-let ?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",247
"248","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",248
"249","20951. Is the whole of your brother's property sub-let?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",249
"250","—The whole of it is sub-let ",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",250
"251","20952. Are there a great many tenants?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",251
"252","—I think there will be about fifty-seven crofters; and the average rent is about £5, 11s.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",252
"253","20953. Are most of these crofters fishermen?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",253
"254","—Yes, I daresay the most of them are, although I could not give the proportion exactly.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",254
"255","20954. Are these small tenants on your brother's property, in general, under your control and management, just as if you were proprietor?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",255
"256","—Just as if I were proprietor, to the end of my lease, which expires, I think, in 1886.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",256
"257","20955. I have no doubt you are aware that a great deal was said of obligations which the fishermen had iu reference to traders and curers in past times, as to the thraldom in which they were supposed to be kept formerly; we wish very much to arrive at a strictly correct impression of the relations between the fishermen and merchants at the present moment; 'I understood you to say that these small tenants on your brother's property are absolutely under no obligation whatever to fish for you or any other person?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",257
"258","—None at all. I called them together when I first took the property, and told them they were at perfect liberty to fish for me or any other person; and that if they improved the land and kept the houses in repair, and kept the fences up, the rent would never be raised upon them, and I have never raised it.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",258
"259","20956. Those tenants who are not fishing for you lie under no disability or discouragement whatever?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",259
"260","—None in the world.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",260
"261","20957. Do the whole of the fishermen on your brother's property fish for you, or do there happen to be some who don't?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",261
"262","—There are surely some who don't. I think there are more fishing to me now than there were a few years ago.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",262
"263","20958. Entirely by their own election?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",263
"264","—Entirely by their own free will.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",264
"265","20959. But still you can state there are some who do not fish for you, and who fish for others?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",265
"266","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",266
"267","20960. Do you keep an account current with those who fish for you?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",267
"268","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",268
"269","20961. How often is a settlement made?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",269
"270","—Always at November.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",270
"271","20962. And when the settlement is made, supposing there is money due to the fishermen, is that always punctually paid to them in cash at the time?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",271
"272","—Always.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",272
"273","20963. And there is no obligation expressed or understood to spend that money in your shop?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",273
"274","—None in the world.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",274
"275","20964. And they, in fact, spend it where they think proper?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",275
"276","—Yes; and I think that is the case with all the curers in the parish, so far as I am acquainted with them at the present time.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",276
"277","20965. Will you candidly state whether you think the relations between curer and fishermen were less easy and less liberal in former times than they are now?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",277
"278","—I can only speak from hearsay, and I have been told by the old fishermen that was the case.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",278
"279","20966. You think they lay under obligations then from which they are now free?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",279
"280","—Yes, I have been told that by the fishermen themselves.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",280
"281","20967. Then, in your view, are the relations between the fish-curer and fishermen easy and liberal now?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",281
"282","—I am happy to say they are.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",282
"283","20968. You don't think that the fishermen at present lie under any discouragement or hardship in consequence of this rather complicated position of the fish-curer, who is, in a manner, their shopkeeper, landlord, and curer or purchaser, all at the same time?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",283
"284","—No, I think not, because, for all the fish we get to cure, unless in the summer fishing, we pay down",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",284
"285","ready money for all the fish that they catch through all the year—except summer—we pay them cash over the counter.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",285
"286","20969. You mean the fish which they catch in winter?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",286
"287","—Yes, and spring.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",287
"288","20970. There is no account against the fish kept in your books?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",288
"289","—No.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",289
"290","20971. Is that generally the case in Shetland?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",290
"291","—I cannot tell, but I find it very much better for ourselves than to run an account for it.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",291
"292","20972. Part of your transactions with the fishermen is in the way of account current and part in the way of cash payments?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",292
"293","—Yes, that is so.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",293
"294","20973. Is there anything else you wish to state?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",294
"295","—Nothing, except about a pier; if we got any help with a pier here, it would be a great benefit to the whole community, and to the fishermen especially.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",295
"296","20971. What sort of a pier would you desire here?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",296
"297","—Probably a pier extending for sixty yards or so would be a great accommodation.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",297
"298","20975. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",298
"299","—A wooden pier?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",299
"300","—At present we have erected a sort of temporary wooden pier; but we wish something more substantial than that.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",300
"301","20976. A stone pier?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",301
"302","—Yes; cemented.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",302
"303","20977. Is it a work which could be designed and executed on the spot, or would it require an engineer from a distance?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",303
"304","—No, I think it could be done in the neighbourhood.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",304
"305","20978. You have plenty of stone and sand?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",305
"306","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",306
"307","20979. What would be the cost of one that would be sufficient?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",307
"308","—I think about £200.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",308
"309","20980. Sheriff Nicolson.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",309
"310","—Is there no pier here except the wooden thing we have seen?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",310
"311","—No, and it is a great trouble to fishermen.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",311
"312","20981. I wonder fishermen and fish-curers never did it for themselves?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",312
"313","—Unless the pier was built substantially it would not stand.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",313
"314","20982. The Chairman.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",314
"315","—But when the cost would not be greater than £200, should that not be done by the proprietors, fish-curers, and merchants, who would receive interest for so small an expenditure?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",315
"316","—You see we are doing all we can as tenants, and all we can afford to do; it would come too heavy upon us to do more.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",316
"317","20983. What do they charge a fish-curer wanting a place?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",317
"318","—I think the usual charge is £12 a year, besides a royalty of something like 3d. or 4d. a barrel.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",318
"319","20984. Is the water deep enough within one hundred yards?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",319
"320","—Deep enough for those big boats, but not for other purposes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",320
"321","20985. Professor Mackinnon.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",321
"322","—How far out would the pier have to go to accommodate a steamer and deeper vessels?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",322
"323","—Perhaps 200 yards.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",323
"324","20986. Measuring from the high-water mark?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",324
"325","—Yes.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",325
"326","20987. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",326
"327","—Is the place where the wooden pier now is the most suitable place?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",327
"328","—It is the most suitable place for the beach; but I fancy the place where you saw the rocks on the right coming in.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",328
"329","20988. The Chairman",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",329
"330","—What do large boats of forty or fifty feet keel draw?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",330
"331","—About six or eight feet when they are loaded.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",331
"332","20989. And you want a pier which would enable them to come alongside at low water ?",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",332
"333","—Yes, that would do.",367,"John Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",333
