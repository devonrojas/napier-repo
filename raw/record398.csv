"228","—A man who is dead long ago.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",228
"229","22924. Had he a house?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",229
"230","—A small bit of a house, but it is down, I reckon. The roof was off it.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",230
"231","22925. You say you have no lease?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",231
"232","—No.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",232

"240","—I don't know, but we have not the liberty on the island to keep a gun.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",240
"241","22930. Can't you snare hares or kill them without a gun?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",241
"242","—We don't get the liberty.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",242
"243","22931. But are you not aware that the law gives you liberty to kill hares on ground in your own occupation, and that you may kill them by snares or otherwise?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",243
"244","—Yes.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",244
"245","22932. Is the reason that you don't kill them because you cannot afford to get a gun, or cannot afford to buy snares?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",245
"246","—It is because we cannot get leave to do it.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",246

"256","—Yes.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",256
"257","22938. From what does the demand for peats arise?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",257
"258","—I don't know; it is chiefly, I think, for distilleries and things of that kind.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",258
"259","22939. Is there a distillery at Kirkwall?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",259

"266","—I don't know; to towns and places —as perhaps Leith, or some of these towns.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",266
"267","22943. Is there anything remarkable in the quality of the peat which creates a demand for it?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",267
"268","—I could not tell you; there is surely that, or they would not be wanted.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",268
"269","22944. Has there always been a demand for peats since you remember?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",269

"278","22948. Has the proprietor ever given you any answer, or has he ever refused?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",278
"279","—There was no allowance for it.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",279
"280","22949. But did he say he would not give an allowance?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",280
"281","—There is no allowance to kill them at all.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",281
"282","22950. Did you ever hear of anybody being molested or threatened because he killed the hares?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",282
"283","—Yes.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",283

"291","—Some of them were bad enough.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",291
"292","22955. How was the door placed—did they enter the house through the byre, or always by a separate door?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",292
"293","—In the earlier times that was the case, I suppose, with some of them.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",293

"295","—Most of them.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",295
"296","22957. And now they are decent houses?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",296

"322","—Yes, on a part of each.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",322
"323","22970. And part of it on the land of the big tenants?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",323
"324","—No, on the commons; it is not in their boundaries, it is outside.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",324
"325","22971. Outside the boundaries of everybody.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",325

"332","—No, they were natives of the island.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",332
"333","22975. Mr Cameron.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",333
"334","—Is that why you have a tenderer feeling towards them?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",334
"335","—Yes.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",335
"336","22976. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",336
"337","—Does the proprietor, in point of fact, protect the hares?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",337
"338","—Yes.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",338

"340","—No.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",340
"341","22978. It is a dead letter that law in Eday?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",341
"342","—Yes, at present.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",342
"343","22979. And the reason is you are afraid that if you killed them you might be turned out next year?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",343
"344","—Yes.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",344
"345","22980. You have only one cow and one young beast?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",345

"350","—Yes.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",350
"351","22983. Is that the state of the crofters generally?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",351

"353","22984. You told us that a number of people were shifted out of their places, and that some had to go away, and some got places elsewhere—was it for their benefit that the people were put away from where they formerly were?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",353
"354","—It was for the sake of the grouud being made into bigger farms.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",354
"355","22985. Not for the benefit of the people turned out?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",355
"356","—I don't think it.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",356
"357","22986. What extent of arable ground have you got?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",357
"358","—I think, maybe, three acres or thereabout, but I could not just say; 1 never measured it.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",358
"359","22987. Are you able to make a living out of your croft?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",359
"360","—I make it out of the sea.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",360

"364","—Five children and my wife.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",364
"365","22990. If you could get your croft enlarged, and doubled, would you be able to stock it?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",365
"366","—No, there is no chance; it is all hill ground.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",366
"367","22991. But if you got it—or got a nice slice out of one of the large farms, would you be able to stock it?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",367
"368","—I don't know; not very able. I make my living out of the sea.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",368
"369","22992. But wouldn’t you put by money out of your earnings from the sea, for the purpose of stocking the big croft?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",369
"370","—The one year is good, and the next year is bad, and the bad year takes away the benefit of the good one.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",370
"371","22993. How many people did you say were in the island altogether?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",371
"372","—Pharay and Eday go together—800 perhaps. I am not certain at all.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",372
"373","22994. How many crofts may there be altogether on the whole island?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",373
"374","—I could not say, for the island lies in that way that the greater part of the people are along the shore.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",374
"375","22995. There well be fifty at least?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",375
"376","—I could not say.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",376
"377","22996. Who has got the biggest share of the two islands—is it the crofters or the four big farmers?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",377
"378","—It will be the four big farmers, I suppose.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",378
"379","22997. Have they the biggest and the best?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",379
"380","—Some of it is.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",380
"381","22998. Can you give us any idea how many people are living upon those four large farms—how many people will be in the employment of the farmers?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",381
"382","—There is one of them has five pairs of horses.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",382
"383","22999. There will be at least one ploughman for each pair of horses'?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",383
"384","—And they will have 200 sheep.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",384
"385","23000. But how many families will there be altogether on those four farms?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",385
"386","—I don't know; there are nothing but bowmen, and those who work out.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",386
"387","23001. Can you not give us an idea of how many of those families there will be?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",387
"388","—It is mostly young men who are working at the farm, and maybe a bowman or two.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",388
"389","23002. But I suppose, taking it all in all, there will be very few families on these four farms'?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",389
"390","—Not a great many.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",390
"391","23003. You have had more than one meeting in the island about the appointment of delegates'?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",391

"394","—No, it was not the first.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",394
"395","23005. Which was the first to start?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",395
"396","—I don't know; I think it was Rousay, but I am not certain altogether.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",396
"397","23006. Does Rousay belong to this district?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",397
"398","—It lies away to the westward.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",398
"399","23007. Should they be here to-day?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",399
"400","—No, I don't think it; they will, perhaps be in Kirkwall. ",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",400
"401","23008. How many people were present at the largest of the two meetings to which you refer?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",401
"402","—I think about a dozen, or a score; the people were away at the herring fishing this week.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",402
"403","23009. How many were present at the first meeting in June?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",403
"404","—I don't mind altogether.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",404
"405","23010. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",405
"406","—Before you were in your present place, you were in a house with another man?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",406
"407","—Yes, in the house with my father; the laud was taken from him, he was not fit to labour it, and I was sitting with him. And then I went to the big farm, and sat in the house four years, on the ground of the big farm, and wrought in the harvest for the rent.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",407
"408","23011. And then you got this place where you are now?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",408
"409","—Yes.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",409
"410","23012. Are you better off with this place dearly rented than you were with the house?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",410
"411","—It is near the shore for the fishing, that is the main thing.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",411
"412","23013. Are there many people in Eday without land?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",412
"413","—No, there are not very many, except poor people who are not fit to work; all the others have a little land.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",413
"414","23014. What rent was your father paying for the houses without the land?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",414
"415","—He was just sitting under a man who had it, and we just gave them so much work when required; but it was in Mr Laing's time that he had the land.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",415
"416","23015. But if he lost the land he paid nothing for the house?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",416
"417","—Nothing, but the value of our work to the man who had the land.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",417
"418","23016. How much did you work for him?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",418
"419","—Just any time he required my services.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",419
"420","23017. And you got wages for that?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",420
"421","—We got leave to live and work in the house.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",421
"422","23018. Did you get wages when you worked?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",422
"423","—We did not get wages, we just got leave to sit in the house.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",423
"424","23019. What is the size of the farm of Stiel?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",424

"426","23020. Two pairs of horses?",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",426
"427","—Sometimes two.",398,"William Gray","Orkney, Sanday",427
