"1","JAMES M. BARCLAY, Inspector of Poor for Mid and South Yell, Clerk to the School Board, and Collector of Rates (38)—examined.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",1
"2","19497. Professor Mackinnon.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",2
"3","—We were told that the poor rate and the school rate together were 6s. 6d. in this parish, what are the rates in South Yell?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",3
"4","—It is the same in both parishes; they form one civil parish.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",4
"5","19498. North Yell and Fetlar are a separate parish ?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",5
"6","—Yes.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",6
"7","19499. Did you hear the evidence of the previous witnesses?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",7
"8","—Some of it.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",8
"9","19500. Have you any idea how the rates could be reduced in any way and the efficiency of the administration still kept up?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",9
"10","—I don't see how the rates could be reduced at present. The poor rate has been reduced this past year, and I hope to be able to reduce it again this year. But the rental of the parish is low. The valuation of the parish is only some £1500 or £1600. A rate of even 4s.only produces about £300, and there have been as many as seventy paupers on the roll.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",10
"11","19501. How long have you been inspector?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",11
"12","—Eight years.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",12
"13","19502. Do you think there are some people on the roll who would not have been on it if what is called the poorhouse test were applied?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",13
"14","—There are some, but these people are not receiving a very large allowance; a very small allowance generally. Cases of that sort are sometimes taken  on, but the allowance is fixed very low. They are taken on simply to help them. The allowance may perhaps pay their house rent. ",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",14
"15","19503. Looking at the number that can be taken off the roll by the poorhouse test, and considering the expense of erecting the poorhouse and maintaining the inmates in it, would you consider it to be an economical. arrangement for Shetland to enter into such an undertaking as building a poorhouse?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",15
"16","—I think it ought to be done; if it did not save much off the rates, it would at any rate reduce the pauperism. It would reduce the number of paupers, although the allowance to each individual would have to be more. Only real cases of pauperism would then be admitted, because the test would show whether the people had friends who would come forward to help them or not. A great many of our paupers are old people of eighty or ninety years of age.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",16
"17","19504. Are there many of your paupers whom you have to maintain out of Shetland?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",17
"18","—Yes, and they are the heaviest on the parish. Sometimes we have a number in Edinburgh, Lerwick, and different places—people who have gone from the parish, and have not established a residence anywhere else. The allowance given to these people is much larger than what they would get here. They get 2s., 3s., and 4s. a week; whereas if they were here they would only get 9d., Is. or Is. 6d. a week.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",18
"19","19505. And you think you would save in that way?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",19
"20","—Yes. The rates are also kept high on account of the number of pauper lunatics in the asylum. The parish also got into debt at one time, and the rate has been kept up a little to reduce the debt, which is now paid up. Since the pauper lunatic grant was established by Government for the aid and maintenance of pauper lunatics, and the regulation by the Lunacy Board allowing paupers not dangerous to be boarded out, we have been able to save a good deal of money. We were paying £120 a year at one time for paupers in the asylum alone.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",20
"21","19506. Your school rate is high, is it not?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",21
"22","—Yes, 2s. 6d. in the pound.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",22
"23","19507. Is there any prospect of its being reduced?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",23
"24","—Not for some years.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",24
"25","19508. How many schools have you under the new system?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",25
"26","—Six.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",26
"27","19509. How much money have you borrowed to build these?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",27
"28","—The interest on the borrowed money is over £60 a year; the schools cost £1300 or £1400 each.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",28
"29","19510. Do you think you have got schools in every part of the parish where they are necessary?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",29
"30","—In every place where there is any population that will authorise the board to go to the expense. There is only one district where there is no school, and the number of children there is very small.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",30
"31","19511. How are these children educated?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",31
"32","—They have no school at present.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",32
"33","19512. You have not taken advantage of the arrangement by which they can be educated by a lad, and sent to a school for examination?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",33
"34","—We have, but the people would not take advantage of it; they would not have it. There was a teacher appointed on the itinerating scheme, but the people would not have him. There were not ten children, I think, in the district I refer to, and the people wanted a school built, and they are dissatisfied that that has not been done. The School Board applied to the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, and a teacher has been appointed for twelve months, but he has no place to go to.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",34
"35","19513. Is there no corner for him?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",35
"36","—There was a house vacant last winter, and the School Board are at present restoring it to make it suitable for him.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",36
"37","19514. I hope you have not engaged the teacher?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",37
"38","—He was engaged conditionally, if he could find a place to teach in.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",38
"39","19515. Are these new schools being taken advantage of by the children?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",39
"40","—In some districts they attend regularly; in others they do not, and there is no worse district than Mid Yell itself.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",40
"41","19516. Has the School Board taken any steps to force them in?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",41
"42","—There is a compulsory officer who goes to the school and sees who are absent, and some of the  people have been before the board, but none of them have been prosecuted.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",42
"43","19517. I suppose they can give a good many reasons for their children not being at school?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",43
"44","—Yes, but the reasons are not always satisfactory.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",44
"45","19518. But the School Board have not prosecuted any parents?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",45
"46","—No.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",46
"47","19519. Of course, prosecution would be somewhat expensive?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",47
"48","—Yes. All the children, I may say, cannot attend in the winter season.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",48
"49","19520. But they could attend better than they do?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",49
"50","—Clearly; and in some districts where they do attend the school is almost self-supporting, whereas in others the deficiency which has to be made up is over £20; and that accounts for the high school rate.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",50
"51","19521. Are the teachers principally male or female?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",51
"52","—There are three male teachers and three female teachers.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",52
"53","19522. Female teachers can be had cheap; is that the reason you employ them?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",53
"54","—Yes, and they get on quite as well. We have no advanced scholars.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",54
"55","19523. If there was a good school here, don't you think some of the people would take advantage of it, and allow their boys to remain at school some time longer?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",55
"56","—There are three principal schools with certificated male teachers, who ought to be able to give the children a good education.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",56
"57","19524. Are there many boys who remain at school till they are fourteen or fifteen?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",57
"58","—Not many.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",58
"59","19525. Is that less or more the case now than under the old administration ?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",59
"60","—Under the old administration the teaching was very uncertain. There were a few boys who had been at sea, who attended to learn a little navigation.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",60
"61","19526. And has that practice entirely ceased?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",61
"62","—I think those who go in for examinations in the merchant service attend school at the port they are sailing from —Liverpool, or wherever they may be.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",62
"63","19527. And there is nothing now in the way of teaching the older boys navigation?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",63
"64","—No, I should say not.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",64
"65","19528. Mr Cameron.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",65
"66","—What is the population of the parish?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",66
"67","—I am not quite certain, but I was told it was 1708 at the last census.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",67
"68","19529. And there are seventy paupers on the roll?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",68
"69","—Not just now, but there have been that. There are somewhere about sixty just now.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",69
"70","19530. What is the ordinary allowance you give to a pauper?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",70
"71","—About 1s a week to those who are resident in the parish.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",71
"72","19531. And what besides?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",72
"73","—They have a house or hut.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",73
"74","19532. Fuel?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",74
"75","—They have an allowance for peats, and some of them have to be cared for and attended.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",75
"76","19533. Do they get clothing?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",76
"77","—A certain amount of clothing.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",77
"78","19534. Do you give them the Is. a week in meal?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",78
"79","—In money, to buy meal or whatever they require.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",79
"80","19535. But they can hardly live upon that?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",80
"81","—No, they cannot.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",81
"82","19536. What do they do ?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",82
"83","—1 cannot tell you; many of them are old women, and knit so as to supplement what they get; and many of their neighbours are kind to them.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",83
"84","19537. Could they not force you to give them a higher allowance than that?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",84
"85","—In some cases, where they have applied to the Board of Supervision, they have not succeeded. There is no case where any application to the Board of Supervision has resulted in an increased allowance since I became inspector. ",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",85
"86","19538. Where there are children under age, to what extent do you increase the allowance?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",86
"87","—It depends on what the mother is able to do for them.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",87
"88","19539. What would be the allowance of a woman with three children?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",88
"89","—We have none of these; we have few cases of that sort on the roll.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",89
"90","19540. Your allowauce appears to be small, and your rate high?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",90
"91","—Yes.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",91
"92","19511. And you think that might be improved if you had a poorhouse?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",92
"93","—Yes, it might not at once reduce the rate.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",93
"94","19542. But it would reduce pauperism?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",94
"95","—Yes.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",95
"96","19543. Do you think people would not go into the house if it were used as a test?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",96
"97","—It would be used as a test; and the Parochial Board would be able to give a better allowance to those who were really deserving.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",97
"98","19544. Have the Parochial Board ever taken the subject into consideration?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",98
"99","—Yes, it has been up before them several times, and they have been always frightened at the expense.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",99
"100","19545. Who is the Board of Supervision inspector who comes round here?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",100
"101","—Mr Peterkin.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",101
"102","19546. Has he recommended a poorhouse?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",102
"103","—Often.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",103
"104","19547. But they have never adopted it?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",104
"105","—It has not been adopted yet. Some of the local inspectors drew up a memorial addressed to the",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",105
"106","parochial boards, representing the necessity for a poorhouse, and it is just going the round at present.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",106
"107","19548. The round of what ?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",107
"108","—The round of the parishes. It was to be sent to the various chairmen to be submitted to the boards, pointing out the reasons why the inspectors consider it advisable that the boards should consider the matter again.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",108
"109","19549. The idea was to have one poorhouse for the whole islands?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",109
"110","—Yes.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",110
"111","19550. Do the six schools in this parish supply accommodation for all the children?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",111
"112","—Yes.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",112
"113","19551. Are there not some places too far off?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",113
"114","—Only the one district I mentioned; and if there had been a road all the way, the children would",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",114
"115","not have had over four miles to walk. But there is only a road part of the way.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",115
"116","19552. Is there not a very nasty burn between where the people live and the school?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",116
"117","—It depends on what school the children attend. If the people on the west side were to attend West Sandwick school, they would not have to cross the burn.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",117
"118","19553. How many families have to cross the burn to get to school?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",118
"119","—There are only three families of children on that side of the burn.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",119
"120","19554. Have these families always paid their rates?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",120
"121","—Until recently; there has been a dispute about that lately, and we gave them an opportunity of hearing the decision of the sheriff in the case, and they have been at Lerwick this week. I have a note from the solicitor who acted for us this morning, stating that the case has been up, and has been decided against the people.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",121
"122","19555. Their ground, I suppose, was that they should not be called upon to pay rates, because there was no school available in terms of the Act?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",122
"123","—Yes.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",123
"124","19556. Do you know what reason the sheriff gave in deciding against them?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",124
"125","—No, I have heard no particulars.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",125
"126","19557. But the people have expressed themselves as willing to pay, since they have got a house fitted up as a school temporarily?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",126
"127","—I don't know yet: they will have to pay, because the sheriff has decided against them. We could have proceeded against them by summary warrant, but we did not do that.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",127
"128","19558. In point of fact, it was impossible for the board to erect a school owing to the fewness of the families?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",128
"129","—Utterly impossible. I understand their case would come under a section of the Scotch code  roviding",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",129
"130","that children in an outlying district may be taught at their own houses by a teacher approved of by the inspector, and that the children be brought to a central school for examination.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",130
"131","19559. And you arranged for that?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",131
"132","—We offered them that accommodation last year; but they would not be satisfied unless they got a  school built,",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",132
"133","19560. Are all the teachers certificated?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",133
"134","—Yes, or in the way of earning certificates.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",134
"135","19561. What is their salary?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",135
"136","—£30 for females and £40 for males, and half the fees and half the grants.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",136
"137","19562. Do you know what that amounts to in each school?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",137
"138","—Some of the female teachers made about £50 last year; and they have a free house. And some of them may have an evening school, and so add to their income.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",138
"139","19563. Do the parents of the children like the female teachers as well as the male teachers; is there any dissatisfaction felt about them?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",139
"140","—No.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",140
"141","19561. Do they teach sewing? ",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",141
"142","—Yes.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",142
"143","19565. Singing?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",143
"144","—Yes, most of them.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",144
"145","19566. Do you find that the salary and half the fees and half the grant is sufficient to get a fairly good teacher?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",145
"146","—We have some very good teachers.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",146
"147","19567. Do they belong to the islands mostly?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",147
"148","—No, they are all strangers.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",148
"149","19568. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",149
"150","—Is the valuation roll of the county of Shetland published?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",150
"151","—No, it is not printed.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",151
"152","19569. It never was?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",152
"153","—Not to my knowledge.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",153
"154","19570. Do you know the reason of that \",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",154
"155","—No, I cannot give any reason for it.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",155
"156","19571. Do you get a manuscript copy of it?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",156
"157","—Yes, a certified manuscript copy.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",157
"158","19572. What does the clerk charge you for it?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",158
"159","—Nothing.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",159
"160","19573. We have been told there are a great number of lunatics?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",160
"161","—Yes, there are five or six in our parish.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",161
"162","19571. And, of course, they are all boarded in the south?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",162
"163","—Not now, we have four boarded out in the parish.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",163
"164","19575. I presume that has very much lightened the expense?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",164
"165","—Yes, it has lightened the rates considerably.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",165
"166","19576. What is the assessment you levy in the year?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",166
"167","—A little over £300.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",167
"168","19577. What do you get for the two offices you hold?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",168
"169","—£25 as inspector, and £10 as collector.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",169
"170","19578. Do you find any difficulty in recovering the whole of the assessment, or are there generally arrears?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",170
"171","—We generally get in the greater part of it, but there are some arrears; we have sometimes to wait",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",171
"172","before we get it all in. The people may be hard up one year and better off the next.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",172
"173","19579. Are the old people of eighty or ninety who are on the roll men or women?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",173
"174","—Principally women.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",174
"175","19580. Have they any direct descendants upon whom the board could count ?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",175
"176","—Yes, if the board were to strictly carry out the Act, they would find relatives who might be forced to contribute; but most of the pauper's relatives are not residing in the parish—they are not at hand, and consequently are allowed to escape. They may be in Edinburgh, or Leith, or Lerwick.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",176
"177","19581. Do you let them off often if they are only at the distance of Lerwick !",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",177
"178","—It depends on their circumstances.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",178

"185","19585. Do you think these people return their lands at the full value they would bring if rented ?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",185
"186","—I think so in most cases. The assessor has visited most of them, and tried to ascertain their real value.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",186
"187","19586. Does he sometimes vary the rental given in ?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",187

"189","19587. Was that appealed against to the Valuation Court by those who made up the erroneous returns?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",189
"190","—I think some of them appealed, but I don't think they followed up the appeal..",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",190
"191","19588. I suppose you could not give us any information about the returns in the island of Fetlar ?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",191

"194","—Somewhere under £400. I have seen the valuation, but I could not say for certain the amount. It is some time since I saw the return, but I think it was about £370.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",194
"195","19590. Have you any idea what was the return for the tenants!",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",195

"203","—Yes.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",203
"204","19594. Have you heard the complaints made to-day regarding the want of improved houses, and security of tenure, increase of rent, and want of compensation for improvements: have you known that these complaints were current in the parish for some time before it was known that the Commission was coming round! ",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",204
"205","—I know that in some districts the people have complained of uncomfortable houses.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",205
"206","19595. And have thought the proprietor should have done more to make them comfortable?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",206
"207","—Yes.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",207

"209","—There may have been rare cases, but I don't know of any in my own knowledge of recent years.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",209
"210","19597. Have you not heard that there was considerable dissatisfaction in the parish with regard to these matters ?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",210
"211","—Only when the matter was brought up, and the people tried to find out if there was any cause of",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",211
"212","complaint; and if there is anything they must speak it out",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",212
"213","19598. Did you hear anything said to-day which you did not expect to hear?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",213
"214","—No, I did not",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",214
"215","19599. The Chairman.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",215
"216","—Do you think what you have heard said is on the whole well founded, or the contrary?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",216
"217","—I think generally what I have heard was fairly enough stated, only when they talk about getting good houses, they forget that the building of houses is an expensive thing, and that the proprietor must have interest for his money. They think the proprietor ought to do some things which are quite unreasonable in in the way of repair and rebuilding without an increase of rent. Of course, if a tenant takes a croft with a house upon it, the proprietor has to keep it up, and will do ordinary repairs; but when it comes to the rebuilding of a house, it is a serious consideration, now that wages are so high, and I fancy no proprietor would do it without looking for some return.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",217
"218","19600. Do you think there is any material improvement, or tendency to improvement, in the lodging of the people?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",218
"219","—Yes; within my own recollection there has been considerable improvement on the inside of the houses—lining them with wood, and papering them, and so on. A great many of the houses are lined, some of them all round, others have the ben end or private room —all of them mostly—lined with wood and papered, and that did not use to be the case.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",219
"220","19601. I observed a kind of half-witted person hanging about the door of the church; is that lad in receipt of parochial relief?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",220
"221","—Yes.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",221
"222","19602. How much does he receive?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",222
"223","—£2, 10s. a year and his clothing.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",223
"224","19603. How much is that per week?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",224
"225","—Hardly a shilling. He was only admitted this year.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",225
"226","19604. And one suit of clothing ?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",226
"227","—Just as he requires it.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",227
"228","19605. Does he always require it?-",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",228
"229","—He would need it oftener than he gets it : he is very destructive sometimes.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",229

"233","—No.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",233
"234","19608. Has any application ever been made to place him under restraint, or in an asylum?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",234
"235","—No, he was only admitted on the roll this last year.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",235
"236","19609. He is what might be called an innocent?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",236
"237","—Yes; and it is quite probable the allowance will be increased now that he is getting up to be a man; only he was admitted as a pauper before it was considered necessary to put him on the roll of lunatics.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",237
"238","19610. Who are the members of the School Board here?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",238
"239","—Rev. Mr Watson, Rev. Mr Barclay (my father), Mr Leask, proprietor, Mr Keith, farmer, and Mr Sandison, merchant —five members.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",239
"240","19611. Have there been any contested elections?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",240

"243","—The first time they did.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",243
"244","19613. Were there any candidates brought forward from the class of small occupiers or crofters?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",244
"245","—No.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",245
"246","19614. Has that class of persons shown any desire to be on the board, or to take any interest in the adminsitration of education in the parish?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",246
"247","—Some do take an interest in education, but I have not heard of any who wished to be on the board; there are some who take an interest in education, and are anxious to have their children educated.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",247
"248","19615. But my question was with reference to their being on the board?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",248
"249","—No, I cannot say they have expressed any desire to be on the board",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",249
"250","19616. But you are not aware that any influence has been used in the higher ranks of society to prevent representatives of that class getting into the board?",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",250
"251","—No, I am not aware that there has been any.",348,"James M. Barclay","Mid Yell, Raefirth",251
