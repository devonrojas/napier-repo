"1","ALEXANDER M'LENNAN, Crofter, Eilean Fladda (74)—examined.",149,"Alexander Mclennan","Raasay, Torran",1
"2","7910. The Chairman.",149,"Alexander Mclennan","Raasay, Torran",2
"3","—Have you any information to give us about the evictions which formerly took place in Raasay?",149,"Alexander Mclennan","Raasay, Torran",3
"4","—I was born in the south of Raasay. I was acquainted with the two last lairds, MLeod of Raasay. When the first laird got into difficulties, Mr M'Kinnon, Corrie, was factor, and the sheep began to come to this place. The place was getting into debt ever since then. When Mackenzie took the place from Mr Rainy, there was in his lease power to clear any township that he pleased, and every township was cleared accordingly, except those which were not favourable for sheep. The place was spoiled before Mr Wood got it, and I have to say for myself and for us all three things that I wish to speak to. We got boats when the storm broke; we got a reduction of one-third of this year's rent, because of the badness of the year; and we got seed potatoes. We have now to say of Mr Wood that he is a good landlord.",149,"Alexander Mclennan","Raasay, Torran",4

"10","7913. Are you aware that any people were sent away to America in the time of the M'Leods before Corrie became factor?",149,"Alexander Mclennan","Raasay, Torran",10
"11","—No, that was the first break that was made in the population of Raasay when Corrie became factor, and when M'Leod left Raasay the place was getting into debt.",149,"Alexander Mclennan","Raasay, Torran",11
"12","7914. Before the M'Leods finally lost the property, were there any people sent away by ship-loads ?",149,"Alexander Mclennan","Raasay, Torran",12

"21","have to pay 10s. for the summons. ",149,"Alexander Mclennan","Raasay, Torran",21
"22","7918. Is Mackenzie, the tacksman who had the right to remove the people, alive now?",149,"Alexander Mclennan","Raasay, Torran",22
