"1","JOHN CAMERON, Schoolmaster, Lochaline (52)—examined.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",1
"2","36700. Sheriff Nicolson.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",2
"3","—How long have you been here?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",3
"4","—Eighteen years. ",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",4
"5","36701. You came as one of the General Assembly's teachers?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",5
"6","—Yes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",6
"7","36702. Has there been any difference in the population since then ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",7
"8","—Yes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",8
"9","36703. In what respect ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",9
"10","—The population is less now.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",10
"11","36704. Has that affected your labours as a schoolmaster?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",11
"12","—Not so much now because I am differently paid; I am better paid now than I was before, owing to the new Act it did not affect my emoluments, but it affects the number.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",12
"13","36705. What used to be your attendance when you came first ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",13
"14","—The first year I have seen a weekly attendance of ninety-two —that is the highest weekly average I ever had.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",14
"15","36706. And now?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",15
"16","—Now the highest weekly average will be about thirty.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",16
"17","36707. And is that as good an attendance as can be expected under the regulations of the new Education Act?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",17
"18","—Not quite so good.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",18
"19","36708. If all the children were attending, how many would you have ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",19
"20","—Probably an average of twenty-seven on the year.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",20
"21","36709. But a weekly average ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",21
"22","—Thirty-five or thirty-seven.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",22
"23","36710. Do you know exactly the decrease of the population since you came ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",23
"24","—I could not exactly say.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",24
"25","36711. Have many families gone away since you came?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",25
"26","—Yes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",26
"27","36712. Did they go all at one time, or has it been gradual?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",27
"28","—A good many went away at one time, as far as I recollect, and a number came to the village, and those who could not be accommodated there went somewhere else.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",28
"29","36713. How long ago was that—I suppose the removal we have heard of?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",29
"30","—Yes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",30
"31","36714. Did you know those people before they were removed?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",31
"32","—No, it was the year before I came.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",32
"33","36715. What were their circumstances when they were removed to the village ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",33
"34","—I could not say, they did not appear altogether empty; indeed most of them had a little money, so far as I could understand, arising from the sale of their cattle. And some were better off; they had larger farms which they had left—twenty-eight pounders.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",34
"35","36716. I suppose the village has increased in size since then?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",35
"36","—There has not been a house built since that, so far as I recollect.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",36
"37","36717. And has the condition of the inhabitants of the village improved, or otherwise?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",37
"38","—I cannot say what it was previous to that.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",38
"39","36718. But within the last eighteen years ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",39
"40","—I cannot see any difference.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",40
"41","36719. You don't think they are in a worse position?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",41
"42","—No, I don't.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",42
"43","36720. Do they all find employment?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",43
"44","—Yes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",44
"45","36721. We have been told that there is a number of families who occupy one room; was that the case when you came first ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",45
"46","—I am not aware of it.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",46
"47","36722. Were you sufficiently cognizant of the way in which they lived at that time to be able to tell us how they lived ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",47
"48","—I could not say there was any more than one family in one room.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",48
"49","36723. And now are there not a good many?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",49
"50","—I cannot say there is more than one family in one room. There may be an exception; a young man may have married, and brought in his wife temporarily.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",50
"51","36724. I mean a whole family occupying one apartment; are not there many families in that condition ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",51
"52","—A good many, I think.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",52
"53","36725. What is the cause that there are more in that position than there were when you came first; what has made it necessary?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",53
"54","—Because the houses have been allowed to fall into disrepair. The roofs are off the old houses.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",54
"55","36726. What kind of houses are they?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",55
"56","—The feuars' houses are fairly good; and those of the proprietor, the people have to make them decent themselves. They have to keep them up, I suppose, themselves.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",56
"57","36727. Are you personally acquainted with any of those in which a family occupies a single room ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",57
"58","—Yes, I know a family or two who occupy one room. They have generally a room and a closet.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",58
"59","36728. Are there any vacant houses in the village?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",59
"60","—With the exception of one, I think not.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",60
"61","36729. Why is that one vacant ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",61
"62","—Because it could not be let.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",62
"63","36730. Do you know to whom it belougs?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",63
"64","—Yes, it belongs to Mr M'Callum, writer, Tobermory.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",64
"65","36731. Is that the gentleman who appeared before us yesterday at Tobermory ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",65
"66","—I don't know.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",66
"67","36732. Are there two writers of that name in Tobermory?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",67
"68","—I don't know.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",68
"69","36733. What rent does he charge for the house?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",69
"70","—I don't know; I know what he was asking.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",70
"71","36734. How much?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",71
"72","—£4, 10s",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",72
"73","36735. For one room and closet ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",73
"74","—That is what I understand.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",74
"75","36736. Then even in Lochaline that is considered rather too high a rent ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",75
"76","—Yes, it is.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",76
"77","36737. Do the children attend fairly well at your school?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",77
"78","—Yes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",78
"79","36738. Does the compulsory officer do his duty?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",79
"80","—We have no compulsory officer.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",80
"81","36739. Is there a sanitary officer?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",81
"82","—Yes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",82
"83","36740. Does he do his duty ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",83
"84","—So far as I know. That rests with the Board of Supervision.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",84
"85","36741. Do you know whether there has been any disease in the place arising from the people being crowded?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",85
"86","—No. There was a case or two of measles lately.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",86
"87","36742. Does the School Board of the parish look after your school to your satisfaction ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",87
"88","—Yes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",88
"89","36743. Of whom does it consist ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",89
"90","—Colonel Cheape, Mr Gordon, Captain Shaw, Mr Elliot, and Mr Robertson.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",90
"91","36744. Do any of them visit the school occasionally ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",91
"92","—Sometimes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",92
"93","36745. How many other schools are there in the parish?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",93
"94","—Three.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",94
"95","36746. Are they all placed in the most convenient situations?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",95
"96","— I think so.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",96
"97","36747. How many is your school fitted to accommodate?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",97
"98","—Fifty.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",98
"99","36748. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",99
"100","—You stated there has been a decrease in the population in your time; do you know what the condition of the population is to-day, such as remain, compared with what it was when you came ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",100
"101","—Of the population at that time, there are very few now living, with the exception of some labourers.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",101
"102","36749. But is there more or less poverty now than there used to be?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",102
"103","—There are more paupers, I think.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",103
"104","36750. And those who are not paupers, are they better or worse fed and clothed than they used to be ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",104
"105","—I think they are equally as well fed and better clothed. They may have been quite as substantial formerly, but they appear better clothed.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",105
"106","36751. And they are as well fed?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",106
"107","—-I think they are, so far as I am aware.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",107
"108","36752. How do you account for the increase in the number of paupers ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",108
"109","—I admit that some of those poor people when they left their crofts were getting old and frail and a number of them came to the village, and they became objects of parochial relief.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",109
"110","36753. And you think, if they had retained their crofts, their friends might have supported them?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",110
"111","—Possibly so.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",111
"112","36754. At this present moment you are passing through a phase of pauperism which will disappear after a time ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",112
"113","—Very soon, I believe.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",113
"114","36755. Professor Mackinnon.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",114
"115","—What part of the country do you belong to?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",115
"116","—To Ardgour.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",116
"117","36756. Do you know the condition of life in Lochaber ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",117
"118","—Yes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",118
"119","36757. And you were for a while in Caithness?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",119
"120","—Yes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",120
"121","36758. Was there a crofting community in Berriedale ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",121
"122","—Yes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",122
"123","36759. Of the three districts where was the most comfortable and substantial set of people—crofters ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",123
"124","—Ardgour in my time.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",124
"125","36760. The next?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",125
"126","—I cannot speak as to the crofters here before I came. I know no crofters in the parish, and can't say.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",126
"127","36761. Do you anticipate a greater decrease in the population in Morven ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",127
"128","—I hope not",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",128
"129","36762. You think it has reached a minimum ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",129
"130","—I think it has taken a turn.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",130
"131","36763. And do you expect an increase ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",131
"132","—I expect an increase on this particular estate.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",132
"133","36764. And that the progress will go on, and that the people will get better clad and fed in the future ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",133
"134","—Yes, so far as labourers are concerned; I cannot speak as to crofters.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",134
"135","36765. It is as to the labourers you expect there will be an increase?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",135
"136","—Yes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",136
"137","36766. You expect there will be more work and an increase of labourers ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",137
"138","—Exactly so.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",138
"139","36767. We have heard of labourers sometimes, when they had steady wages, saying that they preferred to be crofters, even when they would scarcely have the same steady employment; do you think that is the feeling of the labourers here ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",139
"140","—I believe it is.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",140
"141","36768. To what do you attribute that feeling?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",141
"142","—I cannot exactly say.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",142
"143","36769. But the feeling exists?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",143
"144","—So far as I am able to judge myself.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",144
"145","36770. I suppose you would not care to give your own opinion as to the relative merits of the two, whether you would sympathise with the feeling of the man who would prefer to be a less opulent crofter rather than a better paid labourer?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",145
"146","—I would not be inclined to do it.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",146
"147","36771. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",147
"148","—You said just now there was a prospect of more labour being had here, and stated pay to labourers?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",148
"149","—Yes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",149
"150","36772. But is it not the fact that the class of paupers almost entirely springs from the labouring class when they got old ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",150
"151","—I am not aware of that.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",151
"152","36773. What class do they generally come from, those on the roll ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",152
"153","—I believe they come both from labourers and crofters.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",153
"154","36774. Do you know of any case of a crofter coming on the poors' roll who was allowed to retain his croft?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",154
"155","—No, I cannot charge my memory at present with it.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",155
"156","36775. I quite admit there may be people, once crofters, now paupers ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",156
"157","—That is what I meant.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",157
"158","36776. As you have known the crofters in your early days in your own native district, and as you have known the family life of the labouring people here for the last twelve years or so, which would you consider the preferable condition of life in which to rear up a family ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",158
"159","—I would like to know whether he was a crofter with four cows or one cow.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",159
"160","36777. Just as you know them?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",160
"161","—Two cows then—I would prefer a crofter in my own day with two cows to a labourer of the present time.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",161
"162","36778. The Chairman.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",162
"163","—You said you were satisfied with the management by the School Board—with your relations with the School Board ; but you were asked a question whether the members of the School Board ever visited the school except on official occasions; did I understand you to say that they never looked in ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",163
"164","—They might have come in, but they have never visited me by surprise or in that way.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",164
"165","36779. But have individual members'of the School Board shown a kindly interest in the progress of the children ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",165
"166","—Oh, yes, speaking to me they have done so. ",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",166
"167","36780. But have they come in to hear the lessons while the children were being taught ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",167
"168","—Not in my school ",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",168
"169","36781. And yours is a public elementary school?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",169
"170","—Yes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",170
"171","36782. Would you feel it an encouragement to you in your work if persons of superior station and official position occasionally looked in to see how you were getting on ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",171
"172","—Not a bit.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",172
"173","36783. You don't want them?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",173
"174","—No; I endeavour to do my duty conscientiously, and I do not care whether they come or not.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",174
"175","36784. Are there any prizes given in the school?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",175
"176","—No.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",176
"177","36785. Nor is there any examination held excepting the examination of the Government inspector?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",177
"178","—None whatever.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",178
"179","36786. Neither in secular instruction nor in religion 9",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",179
"180","—Not now.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",180
"181","36787. Do you think it would be any advantage to the children that there should be prizes given and a kindly extra examination ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",181
"182","—I certainly do think that prizes should be given.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",182
"183","36788. You would not object to the members of School Board and others coming in order to give prizes ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",183
"184","—By no means, the oftener the better.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",184
"185","36789. Perhaps I may have conveyed an erroneous impression to you in a previous question; I did not mean to ask whether you wanted other persons to come in to see how your own teaching was conducted ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",185
"186","—That was the impression it made upon me.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",186
"187","36790. I meant to convey the impression, to see how the children were getting on and to show a kindly interest in their progress ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",187
"188","—Certainly I do not object to that.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",188
"189","36791. What you would object to would be a critical inspection of your own method ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",189
"190","—Yes.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",190
"191","36792. You would have no objection if members of the School Board and others endeavoured to encourage the children by giving prizes ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",191
"192","—Not the slightest.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",192
"193","36793. Do you think that would be agreeable to the parents of the children ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",193
"194","—Certainly, that is my impression.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",194
"195","36794. Is it ever done in this part of the country?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",195
"196","—It has not been done for the last ten or twelve years. It formerly was done when there was a Presbyterial examination.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",196
"197","36795. There was a more kindly interest taken in the schools in that direction ?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",197
"198","—Yes, every year.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",198
"199","36796. You are surrounded by proprietors here; do the proprietors not come in?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",199
"200","—At last examination there was Mr Sellar, M.P. for Haddington.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",200
"201","36797. Last year?",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",201
"202","—Either last year or the year before. It was at the Government inspection he came.",605,"John Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",202
