"2","5822. The Chairman.",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",2
"3","—What is your occupation ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",3
"4","—I was a cottar till last Whitsunday. I have a house. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",4
"5","5823. Have you been freely elected a delegate by your people ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",5
"6","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",6
"7","5824. Were there many of them present ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",7

"9","5825. What statement have you got to make on the part of those who elected you?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",9
"10","—-I have a great deal to say. I remember when Dr M'Lean was tenant of Talisker, and removed two townships which are opposite here—Fiskaveg aud Ardhoil. He was not long there when he left and went to Rum, where he was tacksman. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",10
"11","5826. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",11
"12","—Mention the number of families in this township ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",12

"15","—Can you tell about how many?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",15
"16","— I believe the number was not under ten or twelve, between the two townships. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",16
"17","5828. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",17
"18","—Where did they go ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",18
"19","—To every place about. Some of them went to America, and others were scattered about the country. Then Hugh M'Askill became tenant of Talisker, and he removed the tenants who were in Ardfreck and Heille. There would be fifteen or sixteen families in these two townships. Some of them went to Roag and some went over the way to Snizort. He then began to remove the crofters from Ferrinlea. The number of families in it was about sixteen. He placed some near the distillery those who could not leave the township. My father was one of those removed from Ferrinlea. Some of them went to Unish, Waternish, and others to the island of Rum, some to Roag and Ulinish, wherever they could get a hole to live in. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",19
"20","5829. Was your father a crofter ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",20
"21","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",21
"22","5830. What rent did he pay ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",22
"23","—£3. I then went to service, and then came to Bracadale and took land in Struan, though my house is a good price the other way, at Struan House. I was paying £5, 16s. of rent and what I could grow upon my holding would not winter one cow. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",23
"24","5831. To whom did you pay that?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",24
"25","—To the tacksman of Ulinish, and though we were paying that amount of rent we would not be allowed to keep a pet sheep, and he himself had grazed his sheep for half a year over our land. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",25
"26","5832. They were not allowed to keep sheep themselves but the tenants sheep pastured over their ground in winter ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",26
"27","—Yes. I have no more to say. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",27
"28","5833. How long is it since you came to this tack ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",28
"29","—Twelve years. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",29
"30","5834. The Chairman.",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",30
"31","—Are we to understand that all those families who were cleared from the two places you mention, ten from one and fifteen from another—were crofters ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",31
"32","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",32
"33","5835. Then how was the tacksman or tenant able to evict them? I thought that they would have paid the rent to the landlord ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",33
"34","—The landlord gave the place to Mr M'Askill, Talisker. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",34
"35","5836. With the crofters upon it ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",35
"36","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",36
"37","5837. Then they had nothing to do with the tenant ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",37
"38","—Yes? it was to Mr M'Askill we were paying when he got the tack. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",38
"39","5838. What became of the land which was taken away from all those ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",39
"40","people. Was it given to the tacksman, or given to other tenants ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",40
"41","—He added it to his own tack. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",41
"42","5839. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",42
"43","—Do you represent any place except Struanbeg ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",43
"44","—No. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",44
"45","5840. How many people are living in Struanbeg now ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",45
"46","—I am the only occupant of Struanbeg. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",46

"48","—The people of Struan hereabout. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",48
"49","5842. How many are there in Struan altogether ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",49
"50","—Eighteen families. My croft used to be in Struanmore, and I reside in Struanbeg. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",50
"51","5843. Do they held the land from the landlord or from the tenant ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",51
"52","— We now hold from the landlord wholly. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",52
"53","5844. Has the landlord got possession of the farm ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",53
"54","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",54
"55","5845. You mentioned you had held land up to last year. Did you give it up of your own accord ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",55
"56","—I did not give it up of my own accord. I could get land along with them here, but I could not remove my effects. I have no family, only my wife, and I am ill with rheumatism myself. My wife is ill. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",56
"57","5846. Then though you have a house you pay no rent now ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",57
"58","—I have a cow yet, and I pay for the grazing of it. I don't know yet till we settle  at Whitsunday what it will be. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",58
"59","5847. Are you going to pay for the cow's grass ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",59
"60","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",60

"63","5849. And you expect to be asked ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",63
"64","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",64
"65","5850. What is the customary rent in the country for a cow's grass and a house?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",65
"66","—In Struanmore it used to be £3, 10s. for the outside pasture of a cow. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",66
"67","5851. And that included the house ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",67
"68","—Without the house. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",68
"69","5852. What did you pay for the house?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",69
"70","—I was paying £5 , 16s. for the sort of croft I had in Struanmore. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",70
"71","5853. Including cow's grass ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",71
"72","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",72
"73","5854. Have the other tenants now that Lord Macdonald has the land in his own hands, any direct advantages they did not have before ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",73
"74","—Yes, the cow's grass is not very dear now. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",74
"75","5855. What may their rents be now ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",75
"76","—£2, 5s. is the outgrazing of a cow. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",76
"77","5856. What are they paying for their crofts ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",77
"78","—£3, 10s, between the cow and the croft. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",78
"79","5857 Wrhat are they likely to keep for that ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",79
"80","—One cow. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",80
"81","5858. No sheep ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",81

"83","5859. And for every additional cow they have to pay £2, 5s ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",83
"84","—Yes, we have no right to keep sheep. There is a fence between us and the landlord. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",84
"85","5860. Have you a horse ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",85
"86","—No. There is no saying when they had the right to keep horses. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",86
"87","5861. What size of crofts are these ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",87
"88","—Most of them not more than two acres of arable ground, and scarcely that much of properly arable ground. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",88
"89","5862. And there is some pasture with it ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",89
"90","—Yes, now, when the fence will be put round it. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",90
"91","5863. But that is common pasture ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",91
"92","—Yes. That is common pasture and they can keep on it what they choose. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",92
"93","5864. What like is the pasture ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",93
"94","—Hillocks and rocks that a person cannot make use of. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",94
"95","5865. Do the tenants keep their cows upon it ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",95
"96","—No, it is among the potato and corn ground they do so; it is not wide enough. They cannot get a peat till the crop is taken off the ground. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",96
"97","5866. How long is it since Ferrinlea was cleared out ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",97
"98","—-About forty years ago. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",98
"99","5867. Was your father's family in Harlosh then?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",99
"100","—We have three brothers there. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",100

"104","—Fifty-five or fifty-six years ago. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",104
"105","5870. You are not fit now to keep a lot or stock a lot ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",105
"106","—I have no family, but I have an acre or two besides my house and the cow's grazing. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",106
"107","5871. Did you build the house in which you are ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",107
"108","—Yes, and I am still not the better of my labour in building it. There was not a stone on the ground when I commenced it. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",108
"109","5872. Was it from the difficulty of shifting your house that you did not take a part of the ground with these tenants ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",109
"110","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",110
"111","5873. What would it cost to build a house ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",111
"112","—Between £13 and £14. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",112
"113","5874. Do the other tenants that have now got land from Lord Macdonald complain about anything ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",113
"114","—They are more contented than they were before. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",114
"115","5875. Mr Cameron.",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",115
"116","—Were any of those evicted tenants who went to Unish and other places left on the ground as cottars ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",116
"117","—Not in Minginish, none of those who were removed lived in Minginish. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",117
"118","5876. In fact, they are all away ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",118
"119","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",119
"120","5877. None of them had their condition changed from crofters into cottars, through land being taken away, and their houses left ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",120
"121","—No. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",121
"122","5878. What was the arrangement you spoke about with regard to the sheep pasturing on your crofts in winter. Was that by a special arrangement and included in the rent you paid for the croft?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",122
"123","—No it was no part of the agreement. But when Dr M'Lean would find our sheep in the fank, the owner of any sheep who was not prepared to pay half a crown on the spot for it would have the ears of his sheep cut close to its skull at once. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",123
"124","5879. But under what arrangement was the tacksman at liberty to put his sheep on the grazings of the crofters?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",124
"125","—It was no part of our agreement about the lot. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",125
"126","5880. Was any money paid by the tacksman to the crofters for the pasturing of those sheep ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",126
"127","—No, it was no part of our agreement with the tacksman of Ulinish that his sheep should graze on our lots for six months of the year. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",127
"128","5881. Did they stray there or were they put there ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",128
"129","—We had a shepherd protecting our crofts, and we also had our crofts enclosed with a dyke during the crop time, but when it was reaped the sheep came in upon us. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",129
"130","5882. At the present moment do any of the large tacksmen send their sheep upon the crofters' pasture for six months of the year and pay the crofters for it ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",130
"131","—I don't know of any instance of that for some time past. There are others here who may tell. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",131
"132","5883. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",132
"133","—It is about twelve years since you came to Ulinish?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",133
"134","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",134
"135","5884. And you agreed to pay £5, 16s. for the croft you had?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",135
"136","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",136
"137","5885. You took it from the tacksman of Ulinish ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",137
"138","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",138
"139","5886. And it was part of your bargain that his sheep for a part of the year were to have the wintering of the croft ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",139
"140","—There was no word of that when I took the croft. I found that rule existing when I came to Ulinish. I found that practice existing in the time of my predecessor. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",140
"141","5887. Did you know the tacksman was to have the wintering of the crofts ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",141
"142","—Yes, I knew that that practice existed. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",142
"143","5888. Professor Mackinnon.",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",143
"144","—If you kept up the fence yourself could you not have kept out the sheep?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",144
"145","—A turf dyke would not keep them out. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",145
"146","5889. But if the turf dyke was kept up would it prevent them getting in ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",146
"147","—We never tried to keep them out. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",147
"148","5890. So they just got over the wall and came in because there was better pasture ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",148
"149","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",149
"150","5891. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",150
"151","—You say you would like a little land near where your house is. In whose possession is the land that adjoins your house ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",151
"152","—It is in the hands of Macleod of Macleod. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",152
"153","5S92. Have you applied to Macleod or his factor for a bit ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",153
"154","—I asked the factor twice for a bit of ground near the house, and I have not got it yet. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",154
"155","5893. Do you expect to get it ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",155
"156","—I would be expecting it, but I don't know if I will get it. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",156
"157","5894. Who was the factor ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",157
"158","—Mr Macdonald of Portree. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",158
"159","5895. In regard to the story of the evictions, beginning with Dr M'Lean, how soon after M'Lean got possession of the tack did he remove the people. Were they there for a year or two ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",159
"160","—I think he was not long in alisker when he began the work, but I cannot tell how long.",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",160
"161","5896. I repeat the same question in regard to M'Askill. How long was he in possession before he began to remove them ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",161
"162","—M'Askill would be about a year or two in possession when he commenced the clearances. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",162
"163","5897. Did those people get summonses from the sheriff court to remove, or did they go of their own accord ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",163
"164","—They were warned to remove. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",164
"165","5898. Did you see the warning and read it ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",165
"166","—I could not read it then. I saw him get the paper and all the people get it also. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",166
"167","5899. Was the summons at the instance of the proprietor, or tacksman, or both?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",167
"168","—I cannot tell; I cannot be sure—the people were so ignorant at that time. People who are so ignorant are removed for nothing. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",168
"169","5900. I presume there are other large farms in Bracadale here besides Talisker ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",169
"170","—M'Askill had them all. He had Minginish entirely, and it is now in two tacks. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",170
"171","5901. Who are the tenants?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",171
"172","—The Camerons—Mr Cameron, Talisker, and Mr Cameron, Glenbrittle. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",172
"173","5902. Do you know John M'Askill, Ferrinlea ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",173
"174","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",174
"175","5903. Is he here to-day ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",175
"176","—-Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",176
"177","5904 Is he a delegate ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",177

"179","5905. Do you know an old man named Mathieson ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",179
"180","—Yes; he is here. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",180
"181","5906. Is he a delegate ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",181
"182","—Yes. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",182
"183","5907. Were the people, so far as you know—the numerous families you have referred to as having been removed by M'Lean and M'Caskill—in comfortable circumstances ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",183
"184","—Yes, they were that. They had cattle and horses and sheep at that time. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",184
"185","5908. Are you aware they were in arrear ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",185
"186","—No. I know that some of those who were removed had money to get from M'Leod, the landlord. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",186
"187","5909. Do you mean by that, that they deposited money with him?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",187
"188","— They were at that time earning it in making the road. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",188
"189","5910. Have any of those evictions you refer to taken place under the present M'Leod?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",189
"190","—It was in the time of the present M'Leod's father that the clearances were made—in Dr M'Lean's time. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",190
"191","5911. Do you recollect whether the M'Askill clearances were also in the time of the late M'Leod ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",191
"192","—The clearances in M'Askill's time were made in the present landlord's day. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",192
"193","5912. Are you aware of any family among these numerous families that were removed in this manner, and that settled down in Skye, that they have become prosperous or risen in the world ?",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",193
"194","—Yes; the family of one of them is in Roag. His sons are doing well. None of the heads of the families are alive. Another family of them went to Durinish; those who went to Unish were again scattered. ",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",194
"195","5913. The Chairman.",114,"Murdo Mackay","Skye, Bracadale",195
