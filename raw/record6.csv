"2","286. The Chairman.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",2
"3","—Are you a fisherman as well as a crofter?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",3
"4","—No.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",4
"5","287. How long have you been in possession of your croft?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",5
"6","—I have been all my life on the croft which I now have, and I am fifty-four years of age. I have seen the reigns of three Lords Macdonald in succession, and seven factors.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",6
"7","288. What is the rent of the croft ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",7
"8","—I have half a croft, and I pay £2, 13s. of rent.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",8
"9","289. Has your rent been increased during that period ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",9
"10","—The rent has been increased to me. I am the seventh of my name in possession of the lot in regular succession.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",10
"11","290. How much has your rent been increased since your father's time ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",11
"12","—Nearly one-third of the present amount",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",12
"13","291. For the same ground ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",13
"14","—For the same ground which I now occupy.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",14
"15","292. You have heard the testimony given by the previous delegates ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",15
"16","—Yes.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",16
"17","293. Have you anything to add to their statements?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",17
"18","—I have to bear testimony to the poverty of the township in which I am. I was for a number of years thinking it would be better for me to give it up than to be cultivating it at alL The land was rocky, and was yielding no crop without manure in the way of sea-weed, which we could not get.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",18
"19","294. Is there any charge made for gathering sea-weed ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",19
"20","—We were at one time paying for sea weed, but we cannot get it now for payment.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",20
"21","295. When you paid money for sea-weed, to whom did you pay the money?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",21
"22","—To the late Mr Rainy of Raasay, and on the island of Scalpa. Then for a number of years past we could not get it either at Raasay or Scalpa for love or money.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",22
"23","296. What did the crofters pay for the right of gathering sea-weed to the laird of Raasay or the laird of Scalpa?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",23
"24","—From Is. 6d. to 2s. a small boat-load, which would be equal to two cart-loads or hereabouts. ",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",24
"25","297. Since you have been acquainted with the place has the landlord ever made any expenditure whatever upon work for the benefit of the place, or any building, or for any other purpose ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",25
"26","—He did not spend any money on improvements on the place. We got, at one time, half a year's rent remitted to us in consideration of drains we were making, and we were paying 1s. 0d. in the £ for the amount so remitted to us. Then there was 12s. added to our rents for a bad bit of hill ground that was added to our grazings when Benlee was taken from the other three townships.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",26
"27","298. What township do you belong to ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",27
"28","—Lower Olach. ",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",28
"29","299. Will the restoration of Benlee to the crofters be a benefit to them ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",29
"30","—Yes. ",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",30
"31","300. You heard the statements made by the previous delegates; did you understand them ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",31
"32","—Yes. ",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",32
"33","301. Do you agree with them?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",33
"34","—I do; but there is one thing I wish to say I do not think there is much use of the herring fishing we get about here to support the people, for it has been backward and doing not much good to the inhabitants about for the past twenty years. ",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",34
"35","302. Can you suggest anything which the proprietor or Government could do to improve the condition of the place?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",35
"36","—If we could get more land, so as to let our present land rest and get heart. ",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",36
"37","303. Is there land immediately contiguous to the crofts here which could be given by the proprietor and which could be used by the tenants for that purpose ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",37
"38","—I do not know; there is no such land other than what I have named already—such as Scorrybreck and these places. ",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",38
"39","304. Have you anything further to say before you retire?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",39
"40","—I have to say that I have not for the past number of years taken three months' good out of the land which I occupy; and I have never taken out of it as much as would pay rent to the landlord,—I may say, not even half rent. ",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",40
"41","305. How do you support your family?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",41
"42","—By fishing on the Irish coast, and here and there on the east coast. ",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",42
"43","306. Are you a fishermen ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",43
"44","—I am not a fisherman at home. I fish away from home. There was no fishing at home for me to engage in. ",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",44
"45","307. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",45
"46","—Is there no sea-ware belonging to Olach which you could get ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",46
"47","—No, there is no ware on the shore of Olach. This shore is a perpendicular cliff.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",47
"48","308. With regard to the work of the landlord, who maintains the road that leads to this place ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",48
"49","—We pay road money.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",49
"50","309. Is it kept up by the county or the district ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",50
"51","—It is a district road.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",51
"52","310. In keeping your cattle during the winter do you give them corn and straw in the sheaf?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",52
"53","—No, we give the cattle the fodder, not the corn in the sheaf. I have only one cow, and I cannot feed the cow off what grows on my lot. I have to buy feeding for her.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",53
"54","311. The Chairman.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",54
"55","—How many sheep?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",55
"56","—I think there are three or four sheep. ",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",56
"57","312. Professor Mackinnon.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",57
"58","—What is the summing?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",58
"59","—The summing of my lot is four cows and thirteen or fourteen sheep, but the lot is not capable of supporting so much stock.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",59
"60","313. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",60
"61","—Do you refer to the wintering or the summering of them ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",61
"62","—The summering itself would not be very good, but they could not do at all to be wintered.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",62
"63","314. The Chairman.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",63
"64","—Your family have been seven generations on the lot; have you heard it stated, from old times, that the land was much more fertile and productive than it is now ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",64
"65","—I have both heard it stated that the land was more productive in past times, and I know it to have been so in my early recollection. In my early recollection there were no merchants in Skye bringing meal to the country, and the men who needed meal would simply have to go to the north end of the island, to what is now ",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",65
"66","Captain Fraser's property, and get meal there.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",66
"67","315. Sheriff Nicolson.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",67
"68","—It used to be called the granary of Skye?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",68
"69","—Yes ; and another evidence of the state of the tenantry of Lord Macdonald is, that there are no mills going on Lord Macdonald's property at the present time.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",69
"70","316. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",70
"71","—How many mills were there ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",71
"72","—I cannot tell very well. There was one at Stenscholl, and one at Camusmore, one at Uig, one at Romisdale, one at Snizort, one at Portree, one at Broadford, and I am not sure whether or not there was one at Knock, in Sleat.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",72
"73","317. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",73
"74","—How many of these are now going?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",74
"75","—The Portree mill is doing a little, and possibly the Romisdale one, but I know of none of the others. I do not know what they are doing on Captain Fraser's property now-a-days.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",75
"76","318. Do you mean there is no business doing, or that they pay no rental for them ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",76
"77","—What I mean is that there is no seed to grind.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",77
"78","319. The mills are there?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",78
"79","—The mills are there, so far as they have not fallen into decay and ruin.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",79
"80","320. The Chairman.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",80
"81","—The meal was formerly made in the country, but now it is imported from Scotland ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",81
"82","—That is the case.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",82
"83","321. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",83
"84","—Are they paying rent still for these mills ? Are they being worked by the proprietors ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",84
"85","—I do not know whether or not the mills are being paid for to the landlord at present, but the Portree mill is principally used as a wool-carding mill.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",85
"86","322. Mr Fraser-Macintosh.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",86
"87","—Do you know whether there are millers at those places, separate from crofters, or are the two businesses carried on conjointly ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",87
"88","—I believe some of the millers do, so far as I know.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",88
"89","323. Professor Mackinnon.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",89
"90","—How do you account for this change? Is it because the land has gone out of cultivation, or because it is bad, or the times are bad, or what ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",90
"91"," —In my opinion, the cause is that the land is run out—exhausted; and a stranger passing by cannot tell the quality of the soil by merely looking at it, it is only those who work it.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",91
"92","324. The Chairman.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",92
"93","—Do the people still grind the byre or oats in hand mills or hollow stones?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",93
"94","—These are not used now-a-days at all. One of these querns ought to be in the Braes.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",94
"95","325. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",95
"96","—Would you put it as one of the grounds for the stoppage of these mills, to some extent, that arable land which is now included in large sheep farms has gone out of cultivation ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",96
"97","— No doubt of that. The land we have has lost its substance, and does not give crop.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",97
"98","326. Professor MacKinnon.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",98
"99","—You mean there is less under cultivation, and the little there is is not good ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",99
"100","—Yes.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",100
"101","327. You say that your own people have been seven generations on the same croft. Has it been made any larger?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",101
"102","—No.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",102
"103","328. Was it larger in the old times ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",103
"104","—Yes, six times",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",104
"105","329. How was it made less?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",105
"106","—The lots were subdivided by order of the factor as the family of the crofter increased.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",106
"107","330. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",107
"108","—You mean, with the consent of the factor ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",108
"109","—It was done by the will of the factor. It could not be done, in these days, without the consent of the factor or will of the factor.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",109
"110","331. Professor Mackinnon.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",110
"111","—Is that going on yet?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",111
"112","—I am not aware if any place that is not so subdivided already that it is not capable of further subdivision.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",112
"113","332. The Chairman.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",113
"114","—Would it be a good thing to prevent the subdivision of crofts below a certain value? Would it be a good thing to fix a certain value below which crofts should never be subdivided ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",114
"115","—If the crofts were not subdivided, the one half of the people would have no land at all.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",115
"116","333. Then, would they not, perhaps, go away and make a better subsistence elsewhere?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",116
"117","—That is not possible to them.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",117
"118","334. Do you remember to have heard that about the year 1841 there were 500 or 600 people who emigrated from the parish of Portree to America?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",118
"119","—I well remember a ship going with the people to America.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",119
"120","335. Did you afterwards hear how those people got on in America ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",120
"121","— From some not good accounts at all were coming, but others got on well.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",121
"122","336. Have any of them come back to see their friends and relations in Skye?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",122
"123","—I am not aware that more than two returned. They came to Sconser.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",123
"124","337. Did they givea good account of the country in America ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",124
"125","—They were giving a good account of America, but for the closeness of the winter.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",125
"126","338. Who paid the expenses of the emigration about forty years ago ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",126
"127","— I believe the emigrants themselves.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",127
"128","339. If the Government or proprietor offered encouragement or assistance, would some of the people be inclined to emigrate?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",128
"129","—I cannot speak as to that. I do not know the minds of the people as to that. ",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",129
"130","340. Professor Mackinnon.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",130
"131","—I suppose when the people were discussing the question that was no tone of the points which they discussed?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",131
"132","—We were not speaking among ourselves of emigration as one of the remedies. ",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",132
"133","341. The Chairman.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",133
"134","—Do you desire to say anything more before you retire ?",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",134
"135","—I have nothing further to say.",6,"Donald Buchanan","Skye, Braes",135
