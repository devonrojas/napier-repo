"1","THOMAS JENKINS, Curer, Burghead (45)—examined.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",1
"2","10678. The Chairman.—You have heard what has been stated by Mr Ross?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",2
"3","—Yes.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",3
"4","10679. Does your opinion correspond generally with his?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",4
"5","—Yes.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",5
"6","10680. Have you any additional statement to make?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",6
"7","—I think Mr Ross has gone over the ground pretty well. Now-a-days everything is done with expedition, and we miss the telegraph so much here that we often miss the market on the Continent. On the east coast, if we do not sell to local agents we sell by telegraph to foreign agents, and generally it is done by telegraph. I have no doubt that if we had the telegraph here we could do the same. We are placed at a great disadvantage. We are placed so that we may perhaps miss the market, or have to sell our herring at a price below what we might get if we had command of the foreign market by telegraph.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",7
"8","10681. Is the foreign market or the home market the more important?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",8
"9","—The foreign market. We do very little indeed in the home market. Looking to the capital employed, there is no other industry in Great Britain, so far as I know, that has not the facilities of telegraphic communication",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",9
"10","in this nineteenth century, and I think we are far behind the age. The capital employed by the fishermen alone amounts to £140,000. The fish curers' capital will amount to £40,000, and the estimated income to",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",10
"11","the country—that is the money realised for our produce—is £70,000 or £80,000. That I consider is a great industry, and a benefit to the country in general; and I think we should have facilities for conducting our ",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",11
"12","business in a proper way, as we have on the east coast",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",12
"13","10682. Your business on the Continent seems to be, as Mr Ross stated, entirely with the North Sea and the Baltic?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",13
"14","—Yes, principally the German and the Russian market.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",14
"15","10683. Why have you no connection with the south of Europe?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",15
"16","—There is a prohibitory tariff in France. A few east coast herring go to Odessa, but the carriage is heavy.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",16
"17","10684. You have no business with Spain, Italy, or any of the Roman Catholic countries ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",17
"18","—None. Germany is our principal market for the east coast fishing, and Russia takes a good deal of our west coast herring.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",18
"19","10685. Do you complain much of the German tariff?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",19
"20","—It is not very high, only about 3s.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",20
"21","10686. What is the reason why the east coast boats are so very superior to the boats on the west coast?—Well, the people have devoted their attention more to fishing, and they are more skilful. The east coast also is more adapted for fishing, and the summer fishing is of mors importance.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",21
"22","10687. If the people here possessed boats of the same class, could they find employment for them during the whole year, or is the weather in the west here so bad outside that the boats could not be used in winter ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",22
"23","—Well, I believe that during the winter it is a very exposed coast, and there are a number of days and weeks, and perhaps months, when they could not prosecute the sea fishing as we do on the east coast. Another",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",23
"24","thing is that I don't think the fishing is so important. The haddock fishing is the east coast fishing, and the winter herring fishing. Of course it has never been tried, and there is room for improvement here.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",24
"25","10688. Then you think that the stress of weather is much greater and more frequent on the west coast than on the east ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",25
"26","—I think so, in Barra.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",26
"27","10689. How many years have you been connected with this place ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",27
"28","—I have been more or less connected with it since 1870.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",28
"29","10690. Do you find the local owners of boats here improving in that period? Are they getting better boats? —It is only within the last three years that there were any native fishermen prosecuting the herring fishing. This year, I understand, there are eight boats from Castle Bay—well-equipped boats. I suppose they half got assistance to enable them to prosecute the fishing, and I think they are doing fairly well.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",29
"30","10691. Sheriff Nicolson.—But not so well as the east coast boats?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",30
"31","—Equally well. They bought them from the east coast people, perhaps two or three years old.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",31
"32","10692. You spoke of the weather being so very stormy ; do you know how many fishing days there have been since the fishing commenced this year?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",32
"33","—Very few; I suppose half a dozen days would cover it. We had two days only this week. Tuesday was the best fishing ever seen in Castle Bay, and last night was very bad.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",33
"34","10693. During most of the time you have been here, has the weather been so stormy that no fishing could be done?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",34
"35","—Comparatively.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",35
"36","10694. I suppose that would be stiU more the case in winter and spring ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",36
"37","—I am sure it would.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",37
"38","10695. Do you think the natives of this place, if they had boats of a suitable sort, would be able to prosecute the fishing systematically, and live by it ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",38
"39","—I believe they would.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",39
"40","10696. Do you know who gave them assistance to get these good boats ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",40
"41","—I think Lady Cathcart and Mr M'Neill, merchant here.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",41
"42","10697. Some of them fish with their old-fashioned smaller boats ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",42
"43","—Yes, at the white line fishing, but not at the herring fishing.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",43
"44","10698. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—You said that though you did not think the fishing on the west coast could be prosecuted all the year round, still it could be developed and improved a good deal In what form do you think it could be improved ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",44
"45","—By a larger class of boats than they use in the winter time. They have only been using the smaller class of boats. The fishing might also be improved by the use of better gear and better lines, and by the men becoming more skilful and more persevering. In that way I believe they would come to develop the fishing in this part of",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",45
"46","the world. ",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",46
"47","10699. Do you concur with what Mr Ross said, that you and the other fish-curers would be disposed to join in giving a guarantee to the Government to make up the interest on the capital required to lay the telegraphic",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",47
"48","lines ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",48
"49","—I believe the curers would be inclined to give a small item, but I maintain that the importance of our industry demands it.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",49
"50","10700. You spoke of £70,000 as the probable income coming into this country from abroad. That is the produce of your herrings ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",50
"51","—Yes.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",51
"52","10701. Have you any idea how many miles of telegraph it will take to go on to Loch Boisdale ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",52
"53","—About twenty miles.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",53
"54","10702. Have you any idea of the expense of the telegraph per mile ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",54
"55","—I cannot say. I think the Government should not make it a matter of expense at all. It is a great source of wealth to the country, and other parts of the country are benefited by us being here.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",55
"56","10703. Do you think that if you had the benefit of the telegraph you would be able, having a proper command of the market, to leave more money behind you ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",56
"57","—I believe we would take more money out of the business, and hence we would give the more for our article.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",57
"58","10701. You would leave more behind you?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",58
"59","—I believe we would. The more we get the more we spend—that is generally the result. The more",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",59
"60","we get on the east coast the more we give to our fishermen, and the more all hands are paid. I cure over 6000 barrels on the east coast, and I could not manage the business without telegraph and telephone.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",60
"61","10705. Mr Cameron. The petitions which Mr Ross spoke of were not signed exclusively by east coast fish-curers ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",61
"62","—No, but by residents in Barra as welL",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",62
"63","10706. And I suppose the guarantees demanded by the Government have generally been demanded from private individuals ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",63
"64","—Yes.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",64
"65","10707. It is generally considered that a public interest of such importance as has been described to us should be considered by the Government without any guarantee?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",65
"66","—I think so.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",66
"67","10708. How long have you been connected with the fishing business ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",67
"68","—I have been curing on my own account for the last twenty-three years.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",68
"69","10709. Here?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",69
"70","—Since 1870.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",70
"71","10710. Do you consider that the people are likely to make better fishermen with large crofts or with small ones?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",71
"72","—My belief is that the fishermen here are partly dependent on the fishing and partly dependent on the land",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",72
"73","—that they should have grazing ground to keep a couple of cows and a score of sheep or so, with the fishing combined.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",73
"74","10711. You think that the time of year when they would be occupied by the fishing would not interfere with the time that would be required for the land ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",74
"75","—No, the cultivation is nothing here ; it is the grazing.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",75
"76","10712. Why is it that the east coast herrings are chiefly in demand in Germany and the west coast herrings in Russia?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",76
"77","—I don't know, but the Russians seem to like a herring that is oilier and fatter in its nature.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",77
"78","10713. They don't take the salt so well as the east coast herring ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",78
"79","—They take the salt, but we don't cure them so salt.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",79
"80","10714. Do they stand a long time?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",80
"81","—Yes, if you keep them away from the sun. They will not stand the sun along with our east coast herrings.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",81
"82","10715. So it is a matter of curing?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",82
"83","—Yes.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",83
"84","10716. And if the Germans chose to buy your west coast herrings, you could salt them ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",84
"85","—Yes. In Germany it is the poorest class in the country who eat the east coast herring, and in Russia it is the richest class who eat the west coast herring.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",85
"86","10717. But you could cure the west coast herring if you had a market for them ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",86
"87","—Yes.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",87
"88","10718. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—It has been alleged that the west coast herring, being fatter and oilier, don't take the salt so well as the east coast ones ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",88
"89","—That is nonsense. You can cure them quite well, if you keep them away from the sun.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",89
"90","10719. Your answer is, that by keeping them from the sun, they can be salted as effectively as the east coast herring ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",90
"91","—Yes.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",91
"92","10720. Mr Cameron.—And if people chose to buy them; you could convey them as easily to the interior of Germany ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",92
"93","—Yes, but if you cure them too salt, people will not buy them.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",93
"94","10721. That applies to the east coast?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",94
"95","—No; there is a certain degree of salt that you must use for the east coast, and if we used the same amount",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",95
"96","of salt for the west coast herring, we would make them uneatable.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",96
"97","10722. That was my impression, but your former answer rather removed that impression?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",97
"98","—They will take the same quantity of salt, but it will make them not of the same value.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",98
"99","10723. There is a difference in the character of the two kinds of herring which makes them require different treatment in regard to salt ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",99
"100","—Yes.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",100
"101","10724. Professor Mackinnon.—Do you get a greater price for the west coast herring from the Russians than you do for the east coast herring from the Germans ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",101
"102","—Yes, double.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",102
"103","10725. And you would spoil the west coast herring by putting more salt upon them?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",103
"104","—Yes.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",104
"105","10726. So they are more valuable in that way ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",105
"106","—Yes.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",106
"107","10727. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—We were told by Mr Ross that last year there were 490 boats. You have been here twelve years; have you known a season when there were 490 boats here, averaging over eighty crans ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",107
"108","—No, not in my experience.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",108
"109","10728. What is the highest fishing you have known here?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",109
"110","—In 1870, 150 crans was the average.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",110
"111","10729. How many boats were fishing that year?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",111
"112","—I cannot say; I think they were in North Bay, Castle Bay, and Vatersay.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",112
"113","10730. Might there have been 450 boats that year?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",113
"114","—Yes, and the average was 150 crans.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",114
"115","10731. Would the price be 50s. per barrel?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",115
"116","—That year it was not so high. It was the year of the Franco-German war, and the blockade was put on, and our herrings were excluded. We had to rush them into the Russian market or get them in by way of Denmark. We lost a pound per barrel in that way.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",116
"117","10732. But it is quite possible that in some seasons you would draw more than £70,000 ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",117
"118","—Yes, we get encouragement to take double that quantity.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",118
"119","10733. I have heard it said that if a fisherman does not fish the whole year regularly, it will not pay to have those large boats with expensive tackle: is that your opinion ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",119
"120","—Well, I don't know that. £400 at 20 percent, is good value. I think they are well able to pay that, supposing they only fished six months.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",120
"121","10734. To whom do the boats belong ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",121
"122","—On the east coast they belong to the fishermen alone.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",122
"123","10735. They are not the property of capitalists, who embark capital in the construction of boats and let them to the fishermen ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",123
"124","—No.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",124
"125","10736. They are a joint stock in the hands of the fishermen?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",125
"126","—Yes.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",126
"127","10737. How many partners are there in a boat?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",127
"128","—Generally two on the east coast, and they hire the others.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",128
"129","10738. Each boat proprietor, then, puts in £150 or £200. Are there a considerable number of men able and willing to do that ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",129
"130","—Well, all our east coast men do that.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",130
"131","10739. Do they borrow much money upon the boat?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",131
"132","—Generally, when they are building a new boat, they get assistance. I have given them £100 to assist them.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",132
"133","10740. The class of boat has improved very much?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",133
"134","—Yes, very much, especially during the last five years.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",134
"135","10741. Is that both with reference to tonnage and construction?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",135
"136","—Both tonnage and construction.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",136
"137","10742. What is the change that has taken place?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",137
"138","—The change is to a boat of a longer keel, with a greater draught of water and greater sea-going ability. The model of the boat has also changed within the last five years from the round, scarfed boat to the type known by the name of the Zulu.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",138
"139","10743. Were the boats always decked as they are now ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",139
"140","—No ; it is about fifteen years'since the first deck was used.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",140
"141","10744. What is your opinion about the introduction of a deck?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",141
"142","—A very great safety.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",142
"143","10745. Is it in all respects better, or are there disadvantages attached to the decking ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",143
"144","—Well, it is in every respect better, and I don't see any disadvantage. Some people say there is greater danger of life being lost; but take the number of hands employed in that industry, and see the number of boats lost every year. Of course when a boat founders in rough weather, that is a different thing; but there are only two or three lost in a season out of the thousands employed. There is no other industry in which there are fewer accidents. Take quarrying, for instance ; there is scarcely a newspaper but contains accidents to quarriers. I consider the deck a great improvement, and I have nothing to say against it.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",144
"145","10746. Is there any change on the rig ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",145
"146","—There have been changes on the sails within the last two years.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",146
"147","10747. Do you think that is an improvement'?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",147
"148","—I think it is.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",148
"149","10748. Do you think there is any further development or improvement to be made in that class of boats?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",149
"150","—Well, I don't know, unless you come to steam.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",150
"151","10749. Are there any herring boats actually furnished with steam ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",151
"152","—There are two or three on the east coast. I think there were two at Aberdeen belonging to Leith, and one belonging to Wick; but they belong to capitalists, and not to fishermen. It requires too much money for a",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",152
"153","fisherman to invest in these. ",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",153
"154","10750. Sheriff Nicolson.—Does the herring fishing here begin before the Stornoway fishing?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",154
"155","—About the same time; about the 1st of May.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",155
"156","10751. We had a statement made to us by a fisherman on the west coast of Skye. In accounting for the decline of the cod and ling fishing, he said that the cod fed on the broken herring at the Barra fishery, and",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",156
"157","were getting so well fed there that they left the shores of Scotland. Is there any ground for that opinion ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",157
"158","—I should think that was a very fanciful reason. But fish are very erratic creatures; they change their localities.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",158
"159","10752. Is the herring got here of the same quality as the Stomoway herring ?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",159
"160","—They are considered superior. ",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",160
"161","10753-4. I suppose the further south you go the finer the herrings are?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",161
"162","—I think that the Castle Bay herring are the finest in Scotland.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",162
"163","10755. Finer than the Loch Fyne herring?",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",163
"164","—You cannot compare loch herring with sea herring. I believe the Loch Fyne herring are the finest for the table. They are fleshier and more plump. The Loch Fyne herring would not cure for the Continent.",181,"Thomas Jenkins","Barra, Castlebay",164
