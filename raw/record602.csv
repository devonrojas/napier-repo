"24","—Yes, there were first six, and afterwards there were only four, so far as I can remember.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",24
"25","36391. Was your father one of the four?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",25
"26","—My father was not. He died, and rny mother had to give up the land.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",26

"32","—One of those who was in Oronsay was the last delegate, another is in Glasgow —he removed",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",32
"33","to Glasgow—and two or three are on the adjoining estate of Mr Dalgleish, Ardnamurchan.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",33
"34","36395. The club farm was abolished, and the people had to go?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",34
"35","—Yes.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",35
"36","36396. Who has it now?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",36
"37","—A large farmer.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",37
"38","36397. What is his name?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",38
"39","—Donald M'Master.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",39
"40","36398. Where did he come from?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",40
"41","—The upper end of the district here. He was a shepherd formerly on Mr Smith's estates.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",41

"43","—I believe he is ; I believe he was born in this parish.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",43
"44","36400. Since you are speaking about Glenmorven estate, from whom did Sir Charles Gordon purchase the property ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",44
"45","—It belonged, I believe, to M'Lean. That was the name of the proprietor before Sir Charles Gordon bought the estate.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",45
"46","36401. Is it an estate of considerable size?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",46
"47","—It is not a very large estate. It is just now in two farms and the home farm, I think, and a few crofters.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",47
"48","36402. Speaking generally, was there not a considerable population in Drimnin at one time ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",48
"49","—There was, I believe.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",49
"50","36403. You have heard that, and have seen it perhaps yourself?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",50
"51","—I remember myself quite distinctly that there were a good many people about the places mentioned in the statement. I remember that there were seven or eight families, not saying I am altogether correct, but so far as I can remember.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",51
"52","36404. In your time were the people scattered out of the estate ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",52

"58","36407. Her son?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",58
"59","—Her son.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",59
"60","36408. It is now all occupied as two farms ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",60
"61","—There are two occupied by farmers, and there is another in the proprietor's hands; and besides there is the home farm attached to the big house.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",61
"62","36409. You were old enough before you left to observe matters ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",62
"63","—I was seventeen when I left the district.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",63
"64","36410. Were the people you used to associate with in comfortable circumstances in the class you belonged to?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",64
"65","—They were fairly comfortable.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",65
"66","36411. Did any of them go away of their own accord, or did circumstances compel them to go ; were they evicted or starved out ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",66
"67","—So far as I know, there were few of them went away of their own accord. It was altogether a matter of ' must' with the majority of those I know.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",67
"68","36412. Were the places in Oronsay from which they were removed suitable for the people of the crofting class ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",68
"69","—It was not very suitable when they went there, but they made it suitable.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",69
"70","36413. Did they keep a mixed stock of cattle and sheep ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",70
"71","—They didn't keep many sheep, but they had five or six cows.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",71
"72","36414. In your young days you never suffered from want of milk?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",72
"73","—I believe I did.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",73
"74","36415. How was that ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",74
"75","—Because when my father died my mother had to give up the land, and cows, and everything, and after that she was dependent on what milk her neighbours would supply her with.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",75
"76","36416. But those who had crofts did not suffer from want of milk?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",76
"77","—I don't think so.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",77
"78","36417. I believe you can give some information about the estate of Glenmorven ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",78
"79","—I wish to give an explanation in regard to the statement that the whole of that estate is one large farm. The people wish to adhere to that statement, because there is practically only one farm on the estate. Captain Shaw has the whole of that estate. There is not another farmer on it besides the crofters, and the crofters have, with very few exceptions, the remnants and useless pieces, such as Bunavullin and Barr, which would be of no use, or very little, for any other purpose.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",79
"80","36418. Had you access to the valuation roll of the county of Argyll to see the returns made for the estate ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",80
"81","—I have not consulted the valuation roll.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",81
"82","36419. You were merely taking what you have heard the people say?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",82
"83","—Yes, and what I know myself.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",83
"84","36420. But although there may be some question whether or not the whole estate is in one farm, I suppose there is little doubt but that the great bulk of it is in the hands of large sheep farmers ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",84
"85","—Yes, I believe that. Perhaps Mr Smith, the proprietor, pays rent for a certain amount of the estate, but then he cannot be called a farmer, because he does not farm it himself. There is no resident farmer except one.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",85
"86","36421. Will you tell us about the people who were on the estate, were there a great number there in your younger days ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",86
"87","—I don't believe there were many people evicted from that estate. That estate has preserved the people who were on it originally better than any other.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",87
"88","36422. The crofters who remain are as numerous in comparison as on any other estate in the neighbourhood?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",88
"89","—More so.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",89
"90","36423. Have you any further remark to make with regard to that statement ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",90
"91","—No, not particularly; but I wish to state particularly that there is only one farmer on the estate.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",91
"92","36424. Did you know the late Dr M'Leod of Morven?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",92
"93","—I did; I knew him from hearing him preach in my young days.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",93
"94","36425. How many parishes does the district of Morven comprehend ? ",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",94
"95","—The district is all one parish.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",95
"96","36426. Has there not been a very great decrease in that place during the last forty or fifty years ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",96
"97","—Nearly 50 per cent. ",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",97
"98","36427. Did you ever hear it stated that it was a source of great grief to Dr M'Leod that so many of the people were obliged to leave?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",98
"99","—Yes, I have heard it stated, and I have read it.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",99
"100","36427.Are you aware that he over and over again interceded in vain to prevent these depopulations ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",100
"101","—Yes, I am aware of that.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",101
"102","36428. I suppose I need not ask you whether Morven is not considered one of the most fertile and traditionally one of the most interesting parts of the Western Highlands ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",102
"103","—I believe it is considered that,",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",103
"104","36429. May I take it for granted that you and the others connected with the district feel great grief at the present state of matters? ",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",104
"105","—Certainly. When I come from Glasgow, whenever I have a holiday, I feel it very much to see bare walls where the people used to be in pretty comfortable circumstances, and whom I remembered quite well myself.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",105
"106","36430. You have heard what the crofters' delegates state about the poverty of this place we are in; is it consistent with vour knowledge that there is considerable poverty?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",106
"107","—I know they have not stated it nearly so bad as it is.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",107
"108","36431. Are you aware that recently one of the trustees of the property came to reside here, and has been giving some work ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",108
"109","—I am not aware of that.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",109
"110","36432. Don't you know that a pier was erected ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",110
"111","—Yes ; but I don't know whether any of the people were employed at that pier or not.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",111
"112","36433. Or roads ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",112
"113","—There may or there may not, I don't know.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",113
"114","36434. Do you know what were the circumstances under which this village was formed and stances given for houses ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",114
"115","—I cannot tell. It has been pretty much the same way ever since I remember. There have been no improvements except the pier itself, so far as I see.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",115
"116","36435. Have some of the young men who came out of Morven in former times not got on very well in the world ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",116
"117","—Some of them have in other countries, and perhaps in Glasgow and the south. They always get on as well, I believe, as people who came from any other district at any rate.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",117
"118","36436. We have had before us to-day the cases Acharn, Ardtornish, Glenmorven, Lochaline, and Drimnin",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",118
"119","—-is that the whole district comprehended in Morven ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",119
"120","—No, it is not.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",120
"121","36437. What more is there?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",121
"122","—The estate of Glencrepisdale and Landal.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",122
"123","36438. Do these belong to one proprietor ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",123
"124","—Yes.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",124
"125","36439. Who is the proprietor?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",125
"126","—Mr Newton.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",126
"127","36440. Is there any one here from there ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",127
"128","—No; but I am quite willing to answer any questions about it.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",128
"129","36441. Have the people been cleared out there?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",129
"130","—Yes; there is scarcely any person there but shepherds.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",130
"131","36442. Has that been done within the last forty or fifty years ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",131
"132","—Yes, partly; but there have been no evictions recently, because there was nobody to evict.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",132
"133","36443. But they must have been evicted at one time?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",133
"134","—At one time, certainly.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",134
"135","36444. I don't recognise among the names of the present proprietors any single person who seems to have been originally connected with the district ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",135
"136","—The Stewarts, I believe, have been connected with this district for a long time.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",136
"137","36445. These are the only ones ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",137
"138","—I think so.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",138
"139","36446. In the changes which have taken place have the interests of crofting population been in any way considered ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",139
"140","—I don't think so; I cannot see any signs of it.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",140
"141","36447. Coming along here from Ardnamurchan, there seemed to be some nice large farms and plenty of sheep ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",141
"142","—Yes.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",142
"143","36448. These have been looked after?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",143
"144","—Yes; they have been pretty well looked after: they seem to be comfortable enough.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",144
"145","36449. You have considered these matters. Will you now, in one word, suggest what remedy would meet the present state of the crofting population in this district ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",145
"146","—I think I would be very much inclined to take the same view as they have taken themselves in the statement.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",146
"147","36450. More land?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",147
"148","—More land, certainly; they have no land at all.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",148
"149","36451. Fair rent ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",149
"150","—Yes.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",150
"151","36452. No disturbance as long as they pay their rent?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",151
"152","—Yes, and so long as they conduct themselves in a proper manner.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",152
"153","36453. Do you concur in these statements as the true remedy ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",153
"154","—Yes,",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",154
"155","I do.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",155
"156","36454. And the only remedy?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",156
"157","—Yes, in my opinion.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",157
"158","36455. Some people propose free emigration; what do you say to that ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",158
"159","—I think there has been far too much emigration for this district at any rate. If there is much more emigration, there will be no one left at all",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",159
"160","36456. What will then happen ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",160
"161","—When I come from Glasgow I shall have no place to go to.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",161
"162","36457. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",162
"163","—How long was Oronsay a club farm - you say the tenants made it comfortable, how long did they possess it?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",163
"164","—I believe for about twenty or twenty-five years.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",164
"165","36458. What was it before that ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",165
"166","—It may have been—a little of it—arable before that; but I know when the people went there they had to do a great deal of work.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",166
"167","36459. And it was held by a single tenant before that?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",167
"168","—It was never, so far as I remember or so far as I have heard it stated, in the hands of a large farmer until Mr M'Master got it.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",168
"169","36460. But the eight tenants went there; they were not born there ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",169
"170","—They went at the same time.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",170
"171","36461. They didn't go to vacant ground, they must have gone to ground occupied by some one; was it occupied by one or two or three ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",171
"172","—By two or three, I believe. But they had to reclaim the land themselves.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",172
"173","36462. Professor Mackinnon.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",173
"174","—Do you know these houses which are described as having only one apartment ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",174
"175","—I know the houses.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",175
"176","36463. With just one apartment ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",176
"177","—That is all.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",177
"178","36464. And there are two or three in the village of Lochaline that pay direct to the trustees ; I suppose you know that ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",178
"179","—I have heard it stated in evidence.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",179
"180","36465. And there are others who pay to whom—to their neighbours?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",180
"181","—To whomsoever the property they are in belongs.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",181
"182","36466. And the witness stated that they were the highest rented ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",182
"183","—Yes.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",183
"184","36467. Their neighbours charge higher rent than the trustees do?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",184
"185","—Yes ; that was stated.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",185
"186","36468. Do you know, from the circumstances of the people generally, that if they got this valuation of their holdings they would probably be able to take possession of them ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",186
"187","—I have no doubt some of them would ; but whether they could all do so or not is a question.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",187
"188","36469. But you believe that some of them could?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",188
"189","—I am certain they could. They would be assisted by their families in Glasgow; they are all in Glasgow.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",189
"190","36470. And I suppose those who are away take such an interest in those who are at home that they would assist them ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",190
"191","—Certainly.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",191
"192","36471. Suppose a family with some means to get a piece of vacant ground now long out of cultivation, upon what terms would you propose that it should be given to them ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",192
"193","—Yes, on reasonable rent, with a reasonable security that they would not be turned out when they improved",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",193
"194","the place, and that their rent would not be raised to any excessive extent.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",194
"195","36472. Supposing you were to give a lease of twenty years or over, would you make it the same rent from the first year to the last year, or a graduated rent?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",195
"196","—I think where land has been out of cultivation for fifteen years, the rent should be less at first, until the people got two or three crops out of it.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",196
"197","36473. How would you suggest that the rent should be fixed?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",197
"198","—In the case of the landlord and the tenant agreeing themselves about it, I think that would be a very good way. In a case where they could not agree, I should suggest that it be left to be settled by somebody outside",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",198
"199","—probably one appointed by Government for the purpose, or something of that kind.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",199
"200","36474. And such an one would fix the rent and the mode of its apportionment for that piece of ground ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",200
"201","—Yes.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",201
"202","36475. And the length of the lease?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",202
"203","—Yes.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",203
"204","36476. Houses would require to be built?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",204
"205","—Yes ; there are no houses now.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",205
"206","36477. How would these houses be built? At whose expense?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",206
"207","—I should say at the expense of the proprietor; that is my opinion. Certainly the people may be charged as usual, perhaps, some interest for the money laid out, along with their rent.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",207
"208","36478. We have heard it said that when houses were built in that way by the proprietors, they were often dearer than if the people themselves had engaged to build and got assistance, and afterwards got compensation in the event of change ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",208
"209","—I have no doubt in the case of a person being able to build, that would be the best way; but in the case of a man not being able to build, I think it might be settled the other way very well.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",209
"210","36479. That the proprietor should undertake the expense, and charge a reasonable interest ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",210
"211","—Yes, charge a reasonable interest. I don't think any one would go against paying more rent if he got a good house.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",211
"212","36480. Is there any portion of the estate more than another suitable for cultivation?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",212
"213","—This place in which we are just now is very suitable, perhaps, for two or three miles, it is about the best land in Argyll.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",213
"214","36481. This country is very beautiful, but you don't say it is more fertile than Kintyre, for example ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",214
"215","—I think if you go out and take a look through this place just now, you will see some very good land, and land suitable for crofters.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",215
"216","36482. Do you think it is as fertile as Kintyre ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",216
"217","—I don't know; I never was there.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",217
"218","36483. The Chairman.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",218
"219","—I am perhaps not mistaken in supposing you have taken some interest in the preparation of these memorials?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",219
"220","—You are not mistaken, my Lord.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",220
"221","36484. You are cognisant of what they contain?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",221
"222","—Yes; I have read the statements.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",222
"223","36485. For Barr and Bunavullin ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",223
"224","—Yes.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",224
"225","36486. A statement which has been referred to is this—' The whole of this estate, with the exception of a few worthless patches held by the crofters, is one large sheep farm.' Now, I find in the valuation roll four holdings specified—one of £75, two of £25, and one of £48?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",225
"226","—I don't know where they are.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",226
"227","36487. Do you think these holdings are correctly described as  worthless patches ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",227
"228","—I could not say. There are one or two farmers on the estate; I don't know what amount of ground they occupy. I know there are one or two.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",228
"229","36488. In the valuation roll the area of land is not given, but the rental is given, which is a pretty good test. There are four farms —£75, £25, £25, and £48 —to which I have alluded. Do you consider it is probable that these holdings are correctly described as ' worthless patches ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",229
"230","—I don't know that. That may have been overlooked in the statement; it is possible it may have been. I cannot say anything as to that.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",230
"231","36489. I think it right to add that the gross rental of the estate, irrespective of shooting rents, is £733, and that the one farm alluded to is £430 rental, leaving a rental of £303 which has no connection with it ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",231
"232","—There are, I believe, altogether twenty-three crofters on the estate. It is the only estate in this district that has, in any way at all, got a crofter population. These two or three places may have been overlooked in making out the statement, but I don't know whether they are fairly valued or not.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",232
"233","36490. My object is, if possible, to eliminate from this memorial, which may in the main be correct, some expressions which, I think, are ill-advised and inaccurate ?",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",233
"234","—We have no wish that anything inaccurate should appear at all; I have not, so far as I am concerned.",602,"John Macdonald","Argyll, Lochaline",234
