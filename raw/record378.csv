"1","THOMAS EWANSON, Crofter and Fisherman, Papa Stour (50)—examined.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",1
"2","21834. Mr Cameron.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",2
"3","—Have you any statement to make?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",3
"4","—Yes.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",4
"5","We the undersigned, crofters in the island of Papa Stour, hereby humbly beg to bring the undermentioned grievances under which we are at present living, before the notice of the Royal Crofters Commissioners now visiting Shetland. ",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",5
"6","(1) That owing to peat ground being exhausted on the island, we have been compelled to transport our peats for the last twelve years from Papa Little and the Ness of Aithness, the former a distance of nine miles and the latter of ten miles from this island, over a tempestuous bay, often at the risk of life. ",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",6
"7","(2) That since 1870 we have been deprived of a large proportion of our scathold by it being fenced in;  and although this has been done, we have had no reduction of our rents, but on the contrary, for the last thirty years, repeated rises on the rents have been made for reasons unknown to us, so that we consider that if our crofts were valued by a valuator appointed by Parliament, that we would be found at present paying rents for them far above their value. ",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",7
"8","(3) That we have at present no compensation granted us for building outhouses, nor for other improvements made on our crofts, when we remove from them. This we consider is unfair, and is a matter that we think ought to be altered; also that we would very much desire to have security against",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",8
"9","being evicted from our holdings, while we can pay a fair value for them, and wish to remain on them. We hereby appoint Thomas Ewanson and John Sinclair as delegates, to being the above mentioned grievances before the Royal Crofters Commissioners. Trusting that our petition will get their favourable consideration, and their petitioners will ever pray.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",9
"10","—Wm JOHNSON, JOHN UMPHRAY, and twenty-two others.—Papa Stour, July 16, 1883.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",10
"11","21835. You complain that the peat ground is exhausted, so that you are compelled to transport peat a long distance over a stormy bay?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",11
"12","—Yes.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",12
"13","21836. What remedy can you suggest for that state of things?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",13
"14","—We would require some compensation for our work. We are all fishermen, and we spend part of the best time for fishing in procuring peats. Twentyfour days we calculate it takes to bring eight months' fire from Papa Little and Aithness, and that during the best part of our fishing time.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",14
"15","21837. You would like to be paid for the labour of transporting your own peats?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",15
"16","—Yes, or to receive compensation for it in some way from the proprietor. If we spend our time carrying peats to the island, we lose our fishing; and if we lose our fishing, we cannot pay our rents.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",16
"17","21838. Is there any fuel now in the island?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",17
"18","—There is little or nothing now, it is all scalped bare; and that has cleaned all the sort of pasture we had. We take about four months' burning from a part of the island, and about eight months from the other place we transport from. .",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",18
"19","21839. What is the population of Papa Stour?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",19

"24","—Yes, some more some less.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",24
"25","21842. Have you any idea what number of acres each family cultivates?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",25
"26","—I could hardly tell you; four or three, or perhaps not three in some cases.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",26
"27","21843. What is the size of your own croft?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",27
"28","—I was just removed to one there last season, and I cannot tell you exactly.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",28
"29","21844. Is the one you removed to larger or smaller than the one you left?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",29
"30","—About the same size, but it is inferior in quality.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",30
"31","21845. Why were you removed?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",31
"32","—I removed of my own accord to try and better myself.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",32
"33","21846. But you made an unfortunate selection?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",33
"34","—I have three different times removed on the ground of the same proprietor—Lady Nicolson.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",34
"35","21847. Always intending to better yourself?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",35
"36","—Yes.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",36
"37","21848. And have you always made the same unfortunate choice?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",37
"38","—No betterment yet.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",38
"39","21849. Do you propose to try again?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",39
"40","—Yes.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",40
"41","21850. At these different removals, who got the places you left?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",41
"42","—In some cases other tenants on the same proprietor's ground got them, and others were laid waste.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",42
"43","21851. Left unoccupied?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",43
"44","—It is occupied now, but at a reduction of rent",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",44
"45","21852. I am afraid there are too many families residing on Papa Stour for the quantity of fuel on it?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",45
"46","—Yes, and I think about one-third of the people on the place have left on that account.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",46
"47","21853. How many families do you think could remain with the quantity of fuel there is?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",47
"48","—They could not do with the fuel in the island without some from other places.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",48
"49","21854. Could they not manage if the population, were reduced?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",49
"50","—No, not without some of the better quality of fuel along with it.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",50
"51","21855. How long is it estimated that the four months' supply of fuel will last with the present number of families?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",51
"52","—I cannot exactly say.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",52
"53","21856. Does it look like lasting many years?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",53
"54","—No, it is near about out altogether.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",54
"55","21857. Then people will be left shortly without peat in the island at all?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",55
"56","—Yes.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",56

"62","—No.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",62
"63","21861. Do you think it will be possible to live without peat, which you can only get by conveying it twelve miles across a stormy bay?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",63
"64","—It is not possible to do without it.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",64
"65","21862. Peat is a heavy and bulky article to transport?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",65
"66","—It is.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",66
"67","21863. Is there any other property belonging to Lady Nicolson to which the families on the island might be removed?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",67
"68","—None nearer that they could have.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",68
"69","21864. Has she any property on the mainland?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",69
"70","—Yes, but none nearer or more suitable.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",70
"71","21865. Has she any property in the vicinity where peat could be cut?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",71
"72","—None that I know of.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",72

"74","—Yes at present, but some have only a few and some none.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",74
"75","21867. Is there any rule by which the number is regulated?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",75

"78","—It did not stand; it was laid down, but did not stand.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",78
"79","21869. Why did it not stand?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",79

"84","—Yes.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",84
"85","21872. Don't you think the rule was fair and just towards the tenants, that each person should be allowed to put up a certain number and no more?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",85
"86","—Yes, if it were carried out.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",86
"87","21873. But the majority of the tenants thought otherwise?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",87
"88","—Yes; those that had the stock put them on again, and the others had not the ability to raise the stock.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",88
"89","21874. When was the scathold taken off—ten or fourteen years ago?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",89

"111","21885. Is that about an average of what each crofter keeps?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",111
"112","—That is about the average of what can be kept; some have none at all, and some have double, treble, or quadruple that.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",112
"113","21886. Do they all pay the same rent?",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",113
"114","—There is a difference in the rents of the crofts, but they all pay the same for the scathold; there is no",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",114
"115","difference with respect to that",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",115

"128","—Very likely it does, but I cannot tell; we are not using it.",378,"Thomas Ewanson","Shetland, Lerwick",128
