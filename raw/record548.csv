"1","COLIN MACDONALD, Crofter's Son, Bunacaimb (35,) assisted by RANALD MACDONALD, Crofter, Bunacaimb (30)—examined.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",1
"2","32532. The Chairman.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",2
"3","—Have you been elected by the people?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",3
"4","—Yes.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",4
"5","32533. Have you any written statement to make?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",5
"6","—Yes. Grievances.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",6
"7","—(1) Rent.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",7
"8","—The rent of Bunacaimb in 1857 was £57, and remained so for three years, when it was increased fully 70 per cent., namely to £100, and at which date we received ""tiles"" for drainage purposes. Then in 1861 land to the value of £11 per annum was taken from us, and in two years after (1863) the greatest part of, and the most valuable of our hill pasture was retained by the proprietor, and has remained in the estate hands since then, namely twenty years, valued at £22, 10s. yearly in proportion to our rents. Again in 1865 land to the value of £15 per annum belonging to the township was let to an incomer, and the rent put into the landlord's pocket, without any reduction in the rent of the rest. In the course of four years a promise of substantial slated houses was given, and on that basis the rent was raised from £100 to £144, but fourteen years have elapsed and the substantial houses have not been built yet. So that our rental for the past twenty-six years has increased fully 150 per cent., and the heart of the hill pasturage kept from us during the past twenty years. ",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",8
"9","(2) Land",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",9
"10","—The average rental is £12, 108. Stock, four cows and followers. The ground is a sandy loam in one part, which is greatly impoverished by the tenants being obliged to plant an incessant potato crop for more than twenty years past on the same ground. Again, the ground raises an inferior corn crop, and after the cattle has received the full produce of hay, corn, and part produce of potatoes, wintering has to be provided. Draining, fencing, trenching, and other works of reclamation have been pushed on in the face of trying obstacles, without any assistance from the proprietor. The land requires an extraordinary amount of sea-ware.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",10
"11","(3) Houses",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",11
"12","—They are in general huts with two apartments, and a few slated houses. The huts and outhouses were built in most cases by the tenants, only in three instances aid to the amount of £4 was given. The oldest lent payer has built two houses, and was obliged to repair a third one, the walls of which are now rent, and the house itself very uncomfortable, as well as being at the mercy of the high tides, which have played havoc at different times. ",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",12
"13","(4) Cattle",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",13
"14","—Our stirks on au average return annually about £5, 10s. Yet it must be understood that the purchasing of wintering materially reduces the average gain from cattle, even to fully £1 per crofter. Again, an old practice of paying £ 1 , 5s. by the neighbour who had one cow in excess to the neighbour who had a deficiency of one cow, was prohibited by the factor. The tenant with one cow extra pays the estate £ 3 for the extra cow; and the tenant whose grass is eaten by the other man's cow is without cow and money. The stirks on an average do not pay our rents, and if our main dependence, namely the herring fishing, proves a failure, we must have recourse to whelk gathering to aid us in paying our rents, as for the last eight years we have had no work provided by the proprietor. The new regulations of 1883 have several rules unbearable, and unless they are modified and in some instances curtailed, we cannot bind ourselves to them. A copy of the rules are on hand, and the objections underlined. ",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",14
"15","Requirements.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",15
"16","(1) Reduction of rent of present holding as may be made by a duly qualified and appointed Government valuator. ",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",16
"17","(2) Increase of land",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",17
"18","—In the first place enough to enable us to keep horses, so as to save men, and especially women, from carrying peats, sea-weed, and dung itself. Land enough we want to save our wives and sisters from serving as beasts of burden. ",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",18
"19","(3) In the next instance, we want room enough for a certain number of sheep, if only for home consumption. ",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",19
"20","(4) Again, we desire room to prevent incessant planting of potato crop on the same ground. Next we seek for substantial and commodious houses, as well as a common fence between the hill pasturage and arable land. And last, we claim compensation for the deprivation of our hill pasturage since 1863.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",20

"40","32535. I understand that; but I ask you whether you merely present this as a picture of what was lost of your own, or whether you claim repayment of it?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",40
"41","—We put it that way to show what we have lost. I mean it to show the way we suffer.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",41

"51","—Yes, and I remember it.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",51

"162","32596. He was removed twice?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",162
"163","—Three times.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",163
"164","32597. And the house, you say, is at the mercy of the high tides?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",164
"165","—Yes.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",165
"166","32598. Has the high tide ever come into the house?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",166
"167","—At different times.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",167
"168","32599. Has he represented that to the proprietor?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",168
"169","—Yes.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",169
"170","32600. He has got older and the house has got worse?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",170
"171","—Yes.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",171
"172","32601. And the complaint is that when a man has one cow too much, he is not allowed to pay the rent for the cow to the other man who has one cow too little. Why has the proprietor prohibited that?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",172
"173","—The factor is here, and can explain that.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",173
"174","32602. Perhaps it was in order to prevent some having too many cattle and others too few?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",174
"175","—If they have too little, they have to pay six month's rent forehand.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",175
"176","32603. You state that you have recourse to gathering whelks, to whom do you sell them?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",176
"177","—They go to London.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",177
"178","32604. How much do you get for them?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",178
"179","—8s. or 10s. per bag.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",179
"180","32605. Who gathers them?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",180
"181","—The women, and the men if the herring fishing fails them. We have no other work.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",181
"182","32606. How much can you make in a week in that way if you are gathering whelks?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",182
"183","—A woman would gather about a bag in a week. She could save say 8s. in the week.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",183
"184","32607. For how long a period in the year can she do that; is it in a particular season?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",184
"185","—It is, and they can only gather them when the tide is out. There may only be five days in a fortnight when they can gather them.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",185
"186","32608. At spring tides?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",186
"187","—Yes.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",187
"188","32609. From whom do you get the winter keep which you purchase for your cattle?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",188
"189","—We get it from the large farmers who have sheep and so on.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",189
"190","32610. What is it—straw and hay?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",190
"191","—Yes.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",191
"192","32611. Have you ever any difficulty in getting it?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",192
"193","—No, in the majority of cases we can; that is, if we have the money to pay for it.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",193
"194","32612. You still have some common pasture?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",194
"195","—Yes, but the best of it was taken from us.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",195
"196","32613. Does what you have lie conveniently to the arable land?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",196
"197","—Yes, pretty convenient, although it is very inferior.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",197
"198","32614. You want a fence upon the hill pasture and the arable land?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",198
"199","—Yes, we got that from the first proprietor, Mr Macdonnell, and we asked our present proprietor to do some of it, but he would not do it.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",199
"200","32615. Is that fence not generally made by the crofters themselves?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",200
"201","—No ; our first proprietor, Mr Macdonnell, was keeping up the fence for us.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",201
"202","32616. But what is the common custom of the country? Is it not that the crofters put up the fence?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",202
"203","—No, it is not.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",203
"204","32617. Does the proprietor do it, or do they do it altogether?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",204
"205","—Well, the proprietor did it for the township I am here representing.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",205
"206","32618. If the proprietor offered to do part of the fence, would you assist him?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",206
"207","—Well, I would, perhaps, conditionally.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",207
"208","32619. The township would assist him?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",208
"209","—I believe we would.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",209
"210","32620. What sort of fence do you want?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",210
"211","—Any kind, to keep out sheep and deer and our own cattle from our crops.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",211
"212","32621. But we have generally found that the crofters put up that fence themselves?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",212
"213","—But I say the reverse; it was kept up by our former proprietors.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",213
"214","32622. Why has it fallen into disrepair?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",214
"215","—It gave way, after having stood for twenty years.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",215
"216","32623. What was it made of?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",216
"217","—Wood.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",217
"218","32624. And when it was put up was there any understanding between you and the proprietor as to who was to repair it or replace it?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",218
"219","—No, we never came to any understanding.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",219
"220","32625. Why was it made of wood; is it not generally made of turf?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",220
"221","—No, it was made of wood.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",221
"222","32626. Have you any stones?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",222
"223","—Stones can be got too; but it would cost far too much to bring stones to the place.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",223
"224","32627. Are there no stones taken out of the arable ground which could be used to make the fence?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",224
"225","—No; there would be very few anyhow.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",225
"226","32628. Do you expect the proprietor to be at the whole expense of making the fence?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",226
"227","—Yes, on account of the rent being so heavy, I think he should do this.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",227
"228","32629. Is there any fence between your hill pasture and the adjoining farm?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",228
"229","—No.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",229
"230","32630. Was there ever a fence?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",230
"231","—Not unless ourselves were doing it.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",231
"232","32631. Do you require a fence?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",232
"233","—Some of us do.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",233
"234","32632. Do the deer do you any harm?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",234
"235","—They don't do us any harm in the township I am here representing.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",235
"236","32633. [To Ranald Macdonald] Have you understood what he has said, generally?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",236
"237","—I understood part of it.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",237
"238","32634. Is there anything you would like to say?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",238
"239","—I think my friend has said all that we had to say.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",239
"240","32635. Mr Cameron.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",240
"241","—Do you not get any work about here?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",241
"242","—There has been no work on the land on which we are for the last eight years.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",242
"243","32636. What sort of work did you get eight years ago?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",243
"244","—The proprietor we had at that time was keeping us in work.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",244
"245","32637. Who was the proprietor?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",245
"246","—Mr Macdonnell. He gave all the work he had on the lands.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",246
"247","32638. How many crofters are there upon his lands?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",247
"248","—Colin Macdonald. Fourteen.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",248
"249","32639. Do they all complain of want of work?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",249
"250","—Yes.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",250
"251","32640. Is there no work on the roads?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",251
"252","—No.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",252
"253","32641. No work in the woods?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",253
"254","—No.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",254
"255","32642. Is it near Lord Lovat's estate?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",255
"256","—Connected with it.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",256
"257","32643. Do you get any work on that estate?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",257
"258","—No.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",258
"259","32644. So that you have to live entirely by the profits of your own crofts?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",259
"260","—We could not live by that; we are dependent upon the herring fishing, and if it fails we have recourse to the whelk gathering.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",260
"261","32645. Do you go to Loch Hourn to the herring fishing?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",261
"262","—Yes.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",262
"263","32646. Do you all go?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",263
"264","—Yes, we all follow that; it is the only thing we have had to depend upon for the last eight years.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",264
"265","32647. The herring fishing has been good for the last two years'?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",265
"266","—It has been.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",266
"267","32618. But it was not so good before that?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",267
"268","—No.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",268
"269","32619. Then your worst time must have been eight years ago when work stopped, and two years ago when the fishing was not good?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",269
"270","—I think our worst time is just now. Formerly we got work from the proprietor, and the fences were kept up, and wood was given to us.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",270
"271","32650. What was the wood given for?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",271
"272","—Fences between the arable land and pasture.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",272
"273","32651. Did you suffer much from the bad season last year?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",273
"274","—We did. We lost almost all we had; and we got no assistance from anybody.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",274
"275","32652. Did you ask for any assistance?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",275
"276","—We spoke of it to those who were relieving the country to see if they could do anything for us, but nothing was done.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",276
"277","32653. Did you plant your crofts with potatoes?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",277
"278","—Yes.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",278
"279","32654. You saved enough of your crop for that?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",279
"280","—We did manage to do it, although we had to suffer on some other side by doing that.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",280
"281","32655. You had to buy the seed?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",281
"282","—We had.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",282
"283","32656. You bought fresh seed?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",283
"284","—Yes; but we sold some of what we had ourselves to better ourselves by getting a change of seed. I believe our factor is prepared to answer that. There was a shop here which bought and sold potatoes. Although we sold some, we bought twice as much.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",284
"285","32657. Is that the first time you adopted a change of seed?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",285
"286","—No. We shift it as often as we think it is to do us good.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",286
"287","32658. Do oats grow here?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",287
"288","—They require a great deal of manure and sea-ware, for the ground is poor, sandy, and mossy —part of it.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",288
"289","32659. Do you put any manure upon it except sea-ware?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",289
"290","—Yes, we do.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",290
"291","32660. Byre manure?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",291
"292","—Yes.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",292
"293","32661. With what do you litter your cattle—do you get ferns?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",293
"294","—No ; because they are so far away from us, and we would have great difficulty in taking them to our byres, because our ground is so small that we cannot keep horses or anything.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",294
"295","32662. What do you use for bedding?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",295
"296","—Sand and sea-ware.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",296
"297","32663. Do you not fish for cod and ling?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",297
"298","—Sometimes we do, when we think that fishing is going to benefit us.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",298
"299","32664. How do you find out when it is to benefit you?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",299
"300","—Well, every fisherman has a good idea of how the fishing is, as it were, going to come on.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",300
"301","32665. You do fish for cod and ling?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",301
"302","—We do.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",302
"303","32666. Do you make much by that?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",303
"304","—Very little in cod and ling, but some years we are very successful in the herring fishing, particularly the last two years. We were very successful—pretty successful.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",304
"305","32667. Do you often go out fishing for cod and ling?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",305
"306","—Just sometimes, we don't go very often.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",306
"307","32668. You don't care much about it?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",307
"308","—We do if we think we can make any money by it.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",308
"309","32669. Is the cod and ling fishing very good here?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",309
"310","—Just middling, not extra good ; but in our present state—so very poor —we are glad to utilise every kind of fishing, although we rely more upon the herring fishing.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",310
"311","32670. Will you explain what you mean by saying that there were several rules made in 1883 which are intolerable?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",311
"312","—His reverence, Mr Macallum, has them in his hand, I believe. One rule is, I believe, that [reads]: ",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",312
"313","All leases shall be for a period of fifteen years, with a mutual break at the end of the seventh year (unless otherwise agreed upon), with a year's: written notice to quit. This notice to be alike available for proprietor as for tenant, and is also to apply to breaks. For crofts where there is no lease, the notice to quit shall be six months, and for cottages without land attached, three months.'",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",313
"314","32671. I suppose you consider that notice too short?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",314
"315","—I cannot understand these rules at all. They were formed by a lawyer, and put in such a way that he could get out of the responsibility. It would be better for me to say I do not understand them at all.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",315
"316","32672. You don't understand them?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",316
"317","—No, I don't really.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",317
"318","32673. Although you don't understand law, you can tell me whether you think notice to quit in six months is too short? Would you like the term to be a year?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",318
"319","—I never read these rules, because they were frightening me, I was told they were that bad. I did not even glance at them. I was told I would not understand them, they were done in such a way by the lawyer that he could get out this way and that way.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",319
"320","32674. What sort of people told you that?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",320
"321","—Intelligent people. They referred me to this that the house was to be put into good order before the tenant entered. It does not say who will have to put them in order; that is one thing.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",321
"322","32675. So, in point of fact, you have not read the rules?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",322
"323","—I never read them in my life.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",323
"324","32676. Were the people who told you they were not worth reading natives of the place or strangers?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",324
"325","—They did not say they were not worth reading.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",325
"326","32677. But they advised you not to read them?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",326
"327","—No.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",327
"328","32678. What did they say?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",328
"329","—They said they were done by a lawyer in such a way that so many questions would require to be asked before a man could understand them.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",329
"330","32679. We should like to know who the people were who told you this?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",330
"331","—I don't like to name any individual party, but I know they were good scholars. I never glanced at the rules myself, because none of them ever were in my possession. I had not even an opportunity of  going over them.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",331
"332","32680. What makes me ask this question is, that in your own statement you say the rules are intolerable, and when I asked why, you say you have not read them, because somebody said you could not understand them. Why did you say in this statement that they were intolerable if you did not read them?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",332
"333","—We drew a line under those we did not like.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",333
"334","32681. Do you wish me to ask you questions about them, or shall we ask somebody else?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",334
"335","—I may say I have been consulting with the Rev. Mr Macallum about them, for he understands them much better than I do ; and certainly he was reading them to me, and marked those that were not going to suit us ; but I did not read them myself.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",335

"340","—One more.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",340
"341","32684. Do you represent the estate generally or your own township?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",341
"342","—Only the Bunacaimb people.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",342
"343","32685. Do you know the whole estate?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",343

"350","—Yes.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",350
"351","32689. Are you aware of anything connected with that family which was prejudicial to the estate—were there not one or two of the proprietors out of their mind?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",351
"352","—Yes, and my father was paying rent to them at that time.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",352

"358","—I don't think it will be much more than thirty-two years, or thereabout, so far as I can calculate; but I am not sure.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",358
"359","32693. How many lairds of this estate were insane?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",359

"363","32695. Was any money laid out upon the estate for improvements during the time of those two proprietors?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",363
"364","—Not that I am aware of.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",364

"370","—Exactly.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",370

"372","—Not so far as I know.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",372
"373","32700. And since he ceased to be proprietor things are no better?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",373
"374","—They are worse; we have not got even a day's work since he sold the estate.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",374
"375","32701. Do I understand you to say that, so far as your land is concerned, it does not support you? You are obliged to earn your subsistence elsewhere?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",375
"376","—That is so.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",376

"385","32706. Who put them away?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",385
"386","—There is some difficulty in explaining that, because there were, may be, thirty families to be evicted from that part of the Arisaig estate, now a deer forest, and Mr Macdonell's mother was so kind as to take them to South Morar, over to her own side for a year and keep them there; but after that, when she was unable to support them, they were obliged to go—to scatter anywhere.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",386

"392","—Yes.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",392

"394","—Yes.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",394
"395","32711. But were any people put out of Morar itself without their consent?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",395
"396","—It was done in some such way as this, they were cramped into a small place by overcrowders coming in as I have shown; but I don't think any of them were evicted.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",396
"397","32712. Can you, or any of the people now living in South Morar, complain that any of your friends were, on former occasions, evicted against their consent?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",397
"398","—Well, I cannot say that they were evicted from so small an estate against their consent. I dare not speak about Arisaig.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",398

"403","32715. Is the present proprietor of South Morar a Highlander?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",403
"404","—Perhaps he is for all I know. His name is Nicholson ; he may be a Skye man; I believe he is.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",404
"405","32716. Why do you call him the proprietor?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",405
"406","—Because he is our proprietor. He married Miss Astley, and that is the way we call him the proprietor.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",406

"414","32720. How long is it since the estate was sold?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",414
"415","—Eight years.",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",415
"416","32721. I understand it was only sold in 1878—five years ago?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",416

"422","32724. Had you work up to the time the estate was sold?",548,"Colen Macdonald, Ranald Macdonald","Inverness-shire, Arisaig",422
