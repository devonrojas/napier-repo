"16","—I came here because I am living in a very bad house, not fit for any person to stop in. When the rain comes out of the heavens, the rain comes running through upon me, —and here is Mr Edmonston sitting hearing me, and I am not telling a lie.",354,"Robert Johnston","Unst, Baltasound",16
"17","19982. You came here because you live in a bad house?",354,"Robert Johnston","Unst, Baltasound",17

"19","19983. Do you think yours is the worst house in Unst?",354,"Robert Johnston","Unst, Baltasound",19
"20","—Yes; the couples split and came down, and the roof is rent and the rain gets in; the roof could not be prized up. The house was occupied by my grandfather.",354,"Robert Johnston","Unst, Baltasound",20
"21","19984. Do you suppose the couples have existed 100 years without repair?",354,"Robert Johnston","Unst, Baltasound",21

"37","19992. Is it the custom for the house to be kept in repair by the proprietor or crofter?",354,"Robert Johnston","Unst, Baltasound",37
"38","—All my neighbours have good houses, and I don't think I should be the one to want a house, because I have always paid my rent. My wife has been badly for twenty years, and she has never been out of the room for seven years, while she has been silly; and I have a daughter who lost her senses, and I went to Mr Edmonston here, and to the inspector at the schoolhouse to get clothes and a supply. I also wanted my poor rates down for the present year, and they would not give me a cent. down.",354,"Robert Johnston","Unst, Baltasound",38

"52","19999. Have you got sufficient scathold for your cattle?",354,"Robert Johnston","Unst, Baltasound",52

"58","—Three my son left me when he went away, and that is all I have to pay with; and I think, if I left and went away a small way, I was not fit to have anything to live upon, and that lass lying badly and fit to do nothing.",354,"Robert Johnston","Unst, Baltasound",58
"59","20002. Did you say your son had a croft?",354,"Robert Johnston","Unst, Baltasound",59
"60","—Yes he has a house.",354,"Robert Johnston","Unst, Baltasound",60
"61","20003. Has he still got it or has he gone away?",354,"Robert Johnston","Unst, Baltasound",61

"74","—When there was need for it",354,"Robert Johnston","Unst, Baltasound",74
"75","20010. When you asked the proprietor to repair your house, what reason did he give for not repairing it?",354,"Robert Johnston","Unst, Baltasound",75
"76","—I do not know. I sent him word of it lately, but he paid no attention to it; surely he will do it, but I do not know.",354,"Robert Johnston","Unst, Baltasound",76
