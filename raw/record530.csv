"1","Rev. RODERICK MORISON, Minister of the Parish of Kintail—examined.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",1
"2","31380. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",2
"3","—Have you a statement which you wish to read?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",3
"4","—Yes. 'I am a native of the parish of Kintail, and have resided in it all my life, except for about fourteen years, during which I was settled in other parishes. During that time, however, I was in constant communication with the parish, and visited it frequently. I am therefore intimately acquainted with the condition of the people, with almost every individual of whom I am personally acquainted. The population at the last census was 688—of these about fifty are paupers; there being, including lunatics in the asylum and paupers resident in other parishes, about sixty persons on the poors' roll —of these twenty-three are resident in the villages of Bundaloch and Carndubh. I attribute the excessive pauperism of the parish to the large number of people who have no land 1 worth speaking of. The population has decreased in round numbers about one hundred in each decade during my time, except in the last, when the decrease was sixty-five. The parish is said to contain 213 square miles, which gives an average population of a little over one family to two square miles. I consider that the condition of the people has materially improved in respect of comforts since the earliest times I can remember. My recollections, however, date from a period of exceptional severity, which followed on the failure of the potato crop. The causes of this increased comfort and prosperity are not easy to define, but the fact is beyond question. The people are better clad, fed, and educated than they were a generation ago. They have learned to do more for themselves, have more intercourse with the south, and more friends and relatives there, have better fishing gear, and get better prices for anything they can produce. Some of them are, however, in great poverty still, and how they manage to support themselves it is very difficult to see. There is an almost entire absence of crime among them. During the five years I have been minister here, there has not been a single case before the courts unless one or two trifling breaches of the peace—the most serious of which was, I believe, punished by a fine of 10s. There have been no evictions from houses within my time; but besides the general eviction at Bundaloch, of which evidence is to-day before the Commission, there have been several evictions from lands for non-payment of rent and for keeping shebeens. I think that the management of the estate of Sir Alexander Matheson has been, split from the Bundaloch case, on the whole judicious and kindly, and does not at present afford much ground for complaint. The tenants have been assisted to build better houses; in many cases feus or building leases have been granted to suitable persons, at the village of Dornie substantial reductions of rent have been granted, and generally it appears to me that all that could reasonably be expected has been done for those who are tenants. The whole of the inhabited portion of the parish belongs to Sir Alexander Matheson—the portion belonging to Chisholm of Chisholm being entirely deer forest and a sheep farm. A large portion of the grazing land in the heights of the parish has been turned into deer forests. £1905 is paid for forest land in the parish by one person, who in this and the two adjoining parishes pays £3395 for forest land, besides a large sum for the shooting of land farmed by tenants. I entertain very strong opinions as to the injurious effects of deer forests on the country and the people, and if the time at the disposal of the Commissioners admits (or if they will receive a written statement from me on the subject hereafter) should much desire an opportunity of stating my views on that subject",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",4
"5","—R. MORISON.'",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",5
"6","31381. You state that the management of Sir Alexander Matheson's property has been in the main good, with the exception of the eviction of Bundaloch?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",6
"7","—Yes.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",7
"8","31382. And you say there were other evictions for shebeening and non-payment of rent ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",8
"9","—Yes.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",9
"10","31383. Did these evictions at Bundaloch not take place for non-payment of rent ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",10
"11","—I don't know; they were before my time.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",11
"12","31384. And you make these statements without knowing the circumstances?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",12
"13","—I know the people were in great poverty, and likely to be in arrears.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",13
"14","31385. That time followed upon the destitution of 1847-48?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",14
"15","—Yes.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",15
"16","31386. Were arrears common throughout the country at the time ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",16
"17","—I presume so, but that is rather previous to my recollection.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",17
"18","31387. Mr Cameron.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",18
"19","—With regard to the subdivision of the crofts, I suppose you would like to see the cottars enjoy a certain portion of the land ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",19
"20","—Certainly.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",20
"21","31388. Do you think the land near where they reside is suitable for their occupation ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",21
"22","—Yes, but there is not enough for them in the neighbourhood.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",22
"23","31389. How many cottars without land are there altogether in the parish ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",23
"24","—I should think about forty; but that is only a guess.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",24
"25","31390. In what portion of the parish could these cottars find land suitable for their occupation?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",25
"26","—Some of them about Bundaloch.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",26
"27","31391. Could any of these cottars obtain land without subdividing the farms?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",27
"28","—No, I think not; all the land is let to somebody.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",28
"29","31392. Are the farms which require to be subdivided large farms or moderate sized ones ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",29
"30","—We have only one farm which can be called large—Kilellan—which pays £840 I think.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",30
"31","31393. Could any portion of that be suitably given to form crofts?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",31
"32","—I think so.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",32
"33","31394. Are there any cottars resident on that farm?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",33
"34","—Yes; I think three or four.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",34
"35","31395. Is the land in the immediate vicinity of where these cottars reside suitable for cultivation —the land on the large farm ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",35
"36","—Yes.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",36
"37","31396. What is the size of the other farms on which the cottars reside ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",37
"38","—Most of them reside on Bundaloch, which pays a rent of, I think, £130.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",38
"39","31397. Would Bundaloch farm be suitable on which to establish a township of crofters ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",39
"40","—I think so.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",40
"41","31398. Do you think these crofters could profitably occupy the arable land belonging to this farm without the grazing ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",41
"42","—Yes, but not without some of the grazing.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",42
"43","31399. Grazing for what stock would you suggest?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",43
"44","—One cow each.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",44
"45","31400. Do you think that might be done and leave Bundaloch farm a suitable holding for the tenant ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",45
"46","—I cannot offer any opinion as to that.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",46
"47","31401. Are these people of whom you speak likely, supposing they get crofts, to subdivide them ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",47
"48","—Yes, unless they were prevented.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",48
"49","31402. Do you think these people here have any great inclination to subdivide ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",49
"50","—No, I think not; they have not had the chance.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",50
"51","31403. Do you think that by proper estate management the subdivision of which we have found to be one of the greatest evils in the Western Highlands, might be prevented ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",51
"52","—I think so, but I don't think it would be difficult to prevent. We have not many marriages going on or many new families springing up. I think most people consider their crofts small enough.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",52
"53","31404. You say the cottars to whom you refer are in tolerably good circumstances—that is better circumstances than they were in twenty or thirty years ago ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",53
"54","—I think so.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",54
"55","31405. You say it is difficult to account for that. In what way do they earn wages, or do they earn wages ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",55
"56","—Well, there is very little employment going in the parish; fishing is the chief source of income.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",56
"57","31406. Do many of the people go south to get work, and come back in spring ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",57
"58","—No, none I think.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",58
"59","31407. They all reside here the whole year round ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",59
"60","—Yes, very much",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",60
"61","31408. How do they live?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",61
"62","—Really it is hard to say.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",62
"63","31409. Have they any land ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",63
"64","—They are very frugal in their habits, and make a little off the fishing; and sometimes they get an occasional chance of labour.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",64
"65","31410. But they have no land except potato ground?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",65
"66","—That is so.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",66
"67","31411. They have all get a bit of potato ground?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",67
"68","—They have all a patch.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",68
"69","31412. Do many of them have a cow's grass?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",69
"70","—Nearly all of them.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",70
"71","31413. And they don't go south to get labour?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",71
"72","—Not much.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",72
"73","31414. Must not labour in the district be very scarce ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",73
"74","—There is a little sometimes in Lochalsh parish, but very little in the district; but then the number of able-bodied men is not large.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",74
"75","31415. How many able-bodied men are there out of this number of cottars ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",75
"76","—Perhaps twenty-five able-bodied cottars.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",76
"77","31416. Do they sometimes do work for the better class of crofters?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",77
"78","—Sometimes.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",78
"79","31417. Do they do any work for the big farmers?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",79
"80","—Some of them do, and a good many of them go to wintering hoggs.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",80
"81","31418. So that they do get in point of fact employment ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",81
"82","—They get the means of living somehow.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",82
"83","31419. And they eke out what they get by labour of this character by fishing?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",83
"84","—Yes.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",84
"85","31420. Herring or deep sea fishing?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",85
"86","—Exclusively the herring fishing.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",86
"87","31421. Do the herrings come to Loch Duich now ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",87
"88","—Not for some years; but they went to Loch Hourn.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",88
"89","31422. There was a good season there last year?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",89
"90","—There was, but our people didn't get much advantage of it, and they were run off the ground by the big boats. The heavy boats and large crews were too many for them, and many of our people had to give it up.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",90
"91","31423. Are they not good fishermen?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",91
"92","—There are better fishermen than they are.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",92
"93","31424. Do you think if they had better boats they would perhaps be encouraged to fish more and better ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",93
"94","—No doubt they would, and they are improving; they are getting better boats.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",94
"95","31425. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",95
"96","—You were good enough to say you would send in a paper at a later period, but I wish to ask you a few questions. You have stated that there are 213 square miles in the parish of Kintail, that would make 130,000 or 140,000 acres. Can you tell me how much of that in your parish is under forest?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",96
"97","—I cannot give the acreage, but I should think something like one-fourth of this parish. We are at this moment iu the parish of Glenshiel, but I mean my own parish of Kintail. ",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",97
"98","31426. Betwixt where we are now sitting and the head of the loch there is the farm of Rattagan ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",98
"99","—Yes. ",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",99
"100","31427. There is the appearance of a considerable population having been there at one time ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",100
"101","—Yes, there are some traces of cultivation.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",101
"102","31428. Do you know anything about the time the people were removed from Glenshiel ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",102
"103","—No, I don't.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",103
"104","31429. Was it before your time?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",104
"105","—Yes, long before.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",105
"106","31430. Have you heard there were great evictions?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",106
"107","—Yes, the people were removed somehow by eviction.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",107
"108","31431. Who was the person that removed them?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",108
"109","—I think some of them were removed by Mr Dick, who held the property at one time. I know he removed some from Rattagan, but I don't know how many. These things were long before my time.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",109
"110","31432. Your family have been ministers of Kintail three or four generations?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",110
"111","—Three generations.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",111
"112","31433. Is it not the fact that this man Dick was threatened to be shot for his cruelty to the people ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",112
"113","—Yes.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",113
"114","31434. I believe you have taken a good deal of interest in connection with deer. Is it not a fact that from within about a mile of the Beauly Railway Station you can walk without putting a foot on  anything but deer forest land till you reach the Cro of Kintail?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",114
"115","—Yes.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",115
"116","31435. Practically from sea to sea?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",116
"117","—Yes.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",117
"118","31436. Do you know it to be the case that there are also some fourteen miles of continuous deer forest land in Glen Cannich alone?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",118
"119","—Yes, I have ridden all over it.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",119
"120","31437. Is it not the fact that the whole of the north side of Glen Affric is one vast deer forest extending also to the Cro of Kintail ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",120
"121","—The farm of Lienessie comes into it.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",121
"122","31438. Are not the whole of Guisachan and its glens, except the mains or home farm on the estate, under deer ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",122
"123","—I believe so.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",123
"124","31439. And it reaches also to the Cro of Kintail?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",124
"125","—No, I think not.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",125
"126","31440. What is between?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",126
"127","—Inchancrow and the farm of Knockfin, occupied by Mr Winans as a sheep farm.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",127
"128","31441. Is it the case that from Inver Moriston, the south side of Glen Moriston, is one unbroken deer forest, reaching to Kintail?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",128
"129","—It does not reach to Kintail, but to the parish of Glenshiel.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",129
"130","31442. Is it not a fact that from within about a mile of Balmacaan in Glen Urquhart you can walk on forest ground till you reach Kintail?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",130
"131","—I believe so.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",131
"132","31443. Is it not also the case that from Inver Garry House you can walk on forest land all the way down to the sea at Knoydart ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",132
"133","—I think so. I may add that I have been told that from a short distance of Loch Broom you can walk on deer forest land until within a short distance of Perth.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",133
"134","31444. Do you consider that the extension of afforestment at the rate at which it is going on, is for the public weal ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",134
"135","—Certainly not—not for the ultimate welfare of anybody.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",135
"136","31445. Since your family have been so long resident in the same place, and must necessarily have handed down traditions from father to son, I wish you to state what your own opinion is of the condition of the people in Kintail, and the adjoining places hereabout, prior to the introduction of",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",136
"137","sheep farms ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",137
"138","—I think there would be a much larger number of people in circumstances of comparative comfort than there are now, but I think there were perhaps some people poorer than any that now exist.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",138
"139","31446. How would you distribute the proportion of those that were in circumstances and those who were worse off than they are now?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",139
"140","—That must be a mere guess. I should say half the people were better off and half worse.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",140
"141","31447. There is a deal of poverty about here just now?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",141
"142","—Too great.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",142
"143","31448. Did you hear what the people of Morvich said to-day?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",143
"144","—I did.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",144
"145","31449. It seems rather a pitiable case, is it not?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",145
"146","—Very much so indeed.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",146
"147","31450. Is it not the case, at all events, with regard to them that so far as the soil they possess is concerned, if they were dependent upon it they could not exist ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",147
"148","—Certainly.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",148
"149","31451. Taken all in all, is not Loch Duich with its mountain surroundings, perhaps the most beautiful in the West Highlands, or any part of Scotland ?",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",149
"150","—I think so.",530,"Rev Roderick Morison","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",150
