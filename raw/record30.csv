"1","MALCOLM NICOLSON, Crofter, Shiader (51)—examined. ",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",1
"2","1824. The Chairman.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",2
"3","—How long have you had a croft?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",3
"4","—It is eighteen years since I got the croft which I have at present. ",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",4
"5","1825. You have a written statement which the people have entrusted to you to present ?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",5
"6","—Yes. At a meeting of crofters in Shiader, on 4th May 1883,—Donald Campbell in the chair, the following resolution was carried: ",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",6
"7","—That our principal grievance consists in our rents having been raised three times during twenty-seven years, our original rents being £7, 10s. to £8, 10s., our present rent from £12, to £12, 15s. Originally we occupied more fertile crofts, but these we were deprived of, and were sent to other crofts less fertile than any on the estate. Our present crofts are in close proximity to a rapid cataract, which is most dangerous and destructive when in flood, often carrying away considerable portions of our crops. We have been incurring liabilities for a considerable time back. Should our creditors urge payment, we would be left almost pennyless. Our original crofts were turned into a sheep farm beside us. There were forty-two crofters of us in all in the place. We were all removed—some to Australia and some to America and to various other parts. When we were in our first crofts we were comfortable; we feel  now quite the reverse. It was Major Fraser who removed us. And what we stand in great need of now is an addition to our hill pasture, as it is quite evident that the spot pointed out to us in company with other four townships is quite inadequate to keep up the summing ordered by Captain Fraser. Our stock is starving in the hill, and getting bad usage keeping them from tacks right and left, without fence or dyke to keep them on our own ground; but the truth is, they are forced to trespass when they have hardly anything to eat on their own ground. We welcome the Commission, and leave with confidence our truthful grievance in their hands—TENANTS of Shiader, Uig, on the Kilmuir estate, Skye.' ",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",7
"8","1826. Mr Cameron.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",8

"14","1828. Have you anything to add upon your own part to the statement which you have presented ?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",14
"15","—Our land is open to the north wind, and it is the same way in ripening the harvest, and then I cannot have seed upon it. We did not put a stone of meal into the mill this year in the Glen, and we bought seed oats forby that.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",15
"16","1829. Have you any further statement?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",16
"17","—The people are complaining that the place is very dear, and does not yield a crop, being on a cold place and late in ripening.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",17

"19","—Yes.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",19

"22","1832. Sheriff Nicolson.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",22
"23","—How soon after that?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",23

"25","1833. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",25
"26","—Was it only once raised?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",26

"28","1834. Mr Cameron.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",28
"29","—And some of the tenants' rents were raised more than yours in proportion?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",29
"30","—We were paying between £7 and £8 on the other side of the river at Tallautain.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",30

"38","1838. How much was it raised the first time?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",38
"39","—I think 5s. was the first rise, which was laid upon us in name of the doctor's money.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",39
"40","1839. Does the doctor exist, and does be come to see you?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",40
"41","—Yes.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",41
"42","1840. Do you grudge the money for the doctor, or are you satisfied the doctor is useful ?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",42
"43","—We are satisfied with that payment.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",43
"44","1841. Then you do not complain of that?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",44
"45","—No.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",45
"46","1842. What was the second rise?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",46
"47","—Our rent was next raised to £12.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",47

"50","1844. Did you make a remonstrance to the landlord's factor against this rise of rent ?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",50

"52","1845. His the proprietor or the factor ever done anything to improve your holdings or to better your condition in any respect?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",52
"53","—We were not asked by them to improve our holdings, but we were improving them voluntarily, and we then got a little assistance from the landlord.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",53
"54","1846. In what form?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",54
"55","—The ground officer was sent round to look after the. work, and what the officer thought proper we got.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",55

"57","—Drains.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",57
"58","1848. How long ago is it since the drains were made?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",58
"59","—Ever since we came to our present holdings.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",59
"60","1849. Were the drains useful? did they improve the ground?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",60
"61","—Yes, they improved the ground. It was quagmire when we came to it.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",61
"62","1850. Has the improvement been a permanent one? Does it still exist?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",62
"63","—Yes, it still exists.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",63
"64","1851. Is the ground as well worth £12 since it has been improved, as it was worth £9, 10s. before it was improved?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",64
"65","—No, and it is not worth £9, 10s. even with the improvements. It is as good value now at £12 as it was before at £9, 10s. when we entered ; but the croft never was worth £9, 10s.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",65
"66","1852. Have you been deprived of any hill pasture?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",66
"67","—No, when we were shifted to Shiader we got hill pasture along with the crofts.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",67
"68","1853. Is the hill pasture you got at Shiader as good as the hill pasture at the former place ?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",68
"69","—No, the land that we formerly had had a sunny exposure, and what we now have has not. We have seven weeks of the year that the sun does not shine at all upon us.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",69
"70","1854. You stated there has been a reduction from the rent of £12; how much is the reduction ?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",70
"71","—Five shillings in the pound. ",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",71
"72","1855. How much was your rent last year—1882 ?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",72
"73","—About £9, exclusive of assessments.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",73
"74","1856. Therefore, you are now paying for the improved croft the same that you formerly paid for the croft before it was improved ?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",74
"75","—That is the case.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",75
"76","1857. Then you would not have any reason to complain of the landlord if you continue to hold it at the present rent?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",76
"77","—Only that the rent ever was too high.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",77
"78","1858. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",78

"83","1860. Did you get wages for that ?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",83
"84","—No, nor half wages. I drained my present holding at intervals of five yards three feet deep, otherwise it would not be dry.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",84
"85","1861. Do you know what sum you got altogether for that?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",85
"86","—£6.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",86
"87","1862. The whole sum you got?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",87
"88","—Yes.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",88
"89","1863. And your rent was raised from £9, 15s. to £12?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",89
"90","—Yes.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",90
"91","1864. Did the landlord supply you with tiles or any materials?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",91

"93","1865. The sole outlay by the landlord was £6 ?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",93
"94","—Yes, that is all I got.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",94
"95","1866. Were your neighbours paid at all for their work?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",95
"96","—There were some of them who did the work, but who did not get any remuneration, for the ground officer did not go to see their work.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",96
"97","1867. Was the work sufficiently extensive to make it worth the ground officer's while to go to look at it?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",97
"98","—I do not know, but they themselves are saying they got nothing for their work.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",98

"104","—You went to your present place against your own will, and not with your own consent ?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",104
"105","—Very, very much against our own will and many of us weeping at leaving our former places.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",105
"106","1871. Who has the place you were at formerly?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",106
"107","—Mr Urquhart has it now, but the landlord himself had it at first.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",107
"108","1872. Who was in the place where you now are when you removed into it ?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",108
"109","—It was unoccupied",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",109
"110","1873. Then, did you put up your own houses?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",110
"111","—Yes; every stone to quarry out without any assistance; but we got £ 1 of assistance.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",111
"112","1874. Is it a fact, then, that this original rent of £9, or whatever it was, was a rent that was fixed upon you, and that you must accept the place or leave it ?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",112
"113","—We had the choice of going to a township here and there, if we did not want to go to Shiader.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",113
"114","1875. Were you consulted about the rent you were to pay at Shiader?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",114

"116","1876. Did you make an offer?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",116
"117","—Our predecessor was paying £65 for the land before we entered it, and we offered £68 for it, and our offer was rejected. We then offered £70. The £7 0 was agreed to by the landlord, but when we got our lands we found we had to pay £75.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",117
"118","1877. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",118
"119","—Does that include rates?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",119
"120","—No.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",120
"121","1878. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",121

"123","—Yes.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",123
"124","1879. The Chairman. —When they came to the new place, did they pay the full rent for the first year of their residence ?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",124
"125","—Yes. We entered our lands at Whitsunday, and at Martinmas we paid the full rent.",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",125
"126","1880. Did you pay any rent before you got any crop or any profit from the ground ?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",126

"143","—Would it be several pounds?",30,"Malcolm Nicolson","Skye, Uig",143
