"1","JOHN MACDONALD, Merchant, Inverness (39)â€”examined.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",1
"2","41514. The Chairman.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",2
"3","â€”You appear as a delegate from the association? ",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",3
"4","â€”Yes. ",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",4
"5","41515. Have you a written statement?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",5
"6","â€”I have no written statement. I was merely asked to corroborate the statement that was presented by the first witness, Charles Mackay.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",6
"7","41516. And is there any branch of this question on which you wish to express a personal independent opinion particularly?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",7
"8","â€”I am of opinion generally, that if the crofters throughout the Highlands had more land and security of tenure â€”that is to say, that they would be in no apprehension of removal in their ordinary circumstances â€”they would produce far more out of their crofts, and that they might perhaps devote their attention to the production of various other things from their holdings.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",8
"9","41517. You think that they would not only produce more of what they produce already, but that they would embark in other cultures?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",9
"10","â€”Yes.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",10
"11","41518. What other cultures do you think they might adopt?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",11
"12","â€”I might draw your attention, for one instance, to the large quantities of eggs imported into this country from other countries, and there is a very large quantity of eggs sent from the Highlands to the southern markets besides what is consumed at home. I think that even in this matter alone, the production of eggs throughout the Highlands might be very much increased, so much so indeed that I think an ordinary crofter with a small holding might possibly pay his rent nearly from eggs alone. From calculations I have been making, I do not give them as very accurate, but they are satisfactory to my own mind, I believe that throughout the Highlands, taking the mainland apart from the islands, perhaps upwards of Â£100,000 worth of eggs is produced.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",12
"13","41519. I would like to know how you connect the increased production of eggs particularly with security of tenure. I can perfectly understand that the increased production of corn might be stimulated by security of tenure,â€”a thing that requires a first outlay and a sustained expenditure, â€”",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",13
"14","but surely the stock that produce eggs are more cheaply and rapidly reared and of a more transitory nature than any other stock? ",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",14
"15","â€”I do not connect it with security of tenure; I rather connect it with the increase of the number of smaller holdings.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",15
"16","41520. That if there was more security there would be more small holdings, and the small holdings would produce more small produce?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",16
"17","â€”Yes.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",17
"18","41521. And particularly poultry?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",18
"19","â€”Poultry and other things.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",19
"20","41522. If keeping poultry was more extensively practised on the small holdings, how are the poultry to be fed? Do you anticipate that food would have to be purchased for the poultry, or would the poultry be fed from the ordinary produce of the farm and leavings of the house?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",20
"21","â€”Partly from the produce of the farm and partly from purchased articles.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",21
"22","41523. Have you any example of a small holder devoting himself particularly and profitably to poultry farming?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",22
"23","â€”No, I don't know that it would be to devote himself particularly to it, except as an accompaniment to other things.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",23
"24","41524. They all have poultry already, I fancy?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",24
"25","â€”Yes, I understand they have.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",25
"26","41525. Is there anything else in the way of small produce that you think might be raised upon small holdings, such as small fruits and better sorts of vegetables, and so on?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",26
"27","â€”I may mention I had a communication from a firm in Ireland, who have devoted considerable attention to pork curing and pork rearing, and I have had inquiries about what the prospects would be of starting an industry like this in some part of the west coast and among the crofting population.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",27
"28","41526. But the people on the west coast, at least in the islands, generally have a repugnance to pigs?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",28
"29","â€”I understand they have.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",29
"30","41527. Have they any repugnance to them here in the east?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",30
"31","â€”Not so much.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",31
"32","41528. Do you know any case of small crofts or holdings about here where the farmer devotes himself to raising garden produce for the market and the town at all?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",32
"33","â€”No, not in this locality; but I have heard it repeatedly said that the small holders might with considerable advantage devote considerable attention to the rearing of market produce.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",33
"34","41529. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",34
"35","â€”Have you any personal experience of croft holding?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",35
"36","â€”Not personal.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",36
"37","41530. Or have you any acquaintance among the crofters?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",37
"38","â€”I have.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",38
"39","41531. Were you brought up in the country?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",39
"40","â€”I was.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",40
"41","41532. In your opinion what is the proper size of a small holding? ",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",41
"42","â€”I cannot say as to the acreage, but I know crofts where, say, two or three cows and a horse are kept, and where the family seem to be comfortable and contented, and where they rear respectable families.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",42
"43","41533. Are these crofts situated in positions where the tenants are able to give their labour for hire, or do they live entirely on the croft?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",43
"44","â€”In cases which have come under my notice the members of the family, with perhaps a little outside assistance, are able to cultivate the croft ",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",44
"45","41534. But are they able to do other work besides?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",45
"46","â€”Yes.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",46
"47","41535. Then what size of croft do you think would be able to maintain a family without such outside labour?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",47
"48","â€”I cannot say for that.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",48
"49","41536. You think it would be desirable to bring about an increase in the number of small holdings; in what way do you propose to bring that about?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",49
"50","â€”I am of opinion that the extent of land at present under deer might with advantage to the country and to the people be cut up into small holdings, and I also think it would be for the interests of proprietors themselves and for the country that the land at present under large sheep farms should be cut up into small holdings.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",50
"51","41537. But how do you propose to bring this about?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",51
"52","â€”I would think it would be quite a proper matter for the Legislature to interfere with the deer forests, and to restrict them at all events, or cut them up. ",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",52
"53","41538. Would you have the Legislature restrict the size of farms'?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",53
"54","â€”I cannot say personally that I would. I would not have them to interfere to that extent.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",54
"55","41539. Then how do you think you would induce proprietors to create small farms or crofts?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",55
"56","â€”I have an opinion myself that it would be more for the interest of proprietors themselves to have a large number of smaller well-to-do tenantry on sizes of crofts where they could be comfortable, than",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",56
"57","to have very large farms that are sometimes thrown upon their hands. ",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",57
"58","41540. Do you think that the proprietors themselves are coming to be of that opinion?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",58
"59","â€”Well, I don't know many cases where they are, but I strongly suspect they must surely come to be.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",59
"60","41541. And in the natural course of events you think that the small holdings will increase?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",60
"61","â€”Yes, I rather think so, but I would be inclined to have some indication from the Legislature that it would be necessary in the interests of the people.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",61
"62","41542. That is just the point I want to arrive at. How is the Legislature to indicate this?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",62
"63","â€”Well, they have got over very great- difficulties in the legislature of the country, and probably if you accept the principle I think they might get over that.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",63
"64","41543. Is there anything you wish to state in regard to the evidence you heard here yesterday?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",64
"65","â€”I would like to say for myself, and many others who are associated with me in this matter, that I disapprove of the references that have been made by Dean of Guild Mackenzie to Dr Mackenzie's management of the estate of Gairloch during his time. I do not wish to contradict it in any way, because I am not a native of Gairloch or acquainted with the circumstances of the case, but I simply express my opinion, from Dr Mackenzie's well-known character in this community and throughout the country for many years, his great age, and his present state of health, that we cannot approve of the references made to him when he is not in a position to explain them personally. That is all I wish to say with reference to that matter.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",65
"66","41544. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",66
"67","â€”How long have you been in business in Inverness on your own account?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",67
"68","â€”I have been in Inverness for twenty-five years, and in business for about seventeen years.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",68
"69","41545. Are you aware that it has been for a long period a complaint on the part of the inhabitants of Inverness, and the proprietors of property especially, that the poor rates have been higher in consequence of the number of people who have been evicted from country places, and settling in",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",69
"70","Inverness? ",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",70
"71","â€”I have heard so repeatedly, and cases have come under my notice where parties who had some connection with land in the country have ultimately come to be paupers in the town of Inverness.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",71
"72","41546. If an examination of the roll were made, would it be found that a large number of the paupers were not natives of Inverness?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",72
"73","â€”I believe it will be found so now, but if you examine the roll fifteen or twenty years ago you will find far more numerous cases in that connection.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",73
"74","41547. Has the consequence of that been that the attention of the intelligent public of Inverness has long been drawn to this particular point of the depopulation and evictions that have taken place in the Highlands?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",74
"75","â€”That is so.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",75
"76","41548. So it is not a matter of yesterday with them?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",76
"77","â€”No.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",77
"78","41549. In your business as a merchant do you consider that the establishment of a numerous and healthy crofting class would form a very good sound element for transacting business with?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",78
"79","â€”I do certainly.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",79
"80","41550. Is not the existence of large farms, and to some extent absentee proprietors, prejudicial to commercial transactions?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",80
"81","â€”Decidedly so.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",81
"82","41551. May I assume that nothing can be more sound commercially, to deal with a numerous class rather than with a few?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",82
"83","â€”That is my experience.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",83
"84","41552. You were asked by Sir Kenneth Mackenzie about crofts, and what you would like to do. I presume what you are pointing to at present is simply to give the existing population of the Highlands substantial holdings; that is what you and your associates are pointing at?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",84
"85","â€”Yes, to encourage them, rather than emigration.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",85
"86","41553. And do you fancy there is quite enough of land and to spare for all the people that are now in the Highlands?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",86
"87","â€”Well, I do think so.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",87
"88","41554. Mr Cameron.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",88
"89","â€”Have you ever compared the poor rates of Inverness wjth the poor rates of other large towns, so as to ascertain whether the increase is due to evictions from the neighbouring districts or to the natural gravitation from the country districts into towns?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",89
"90","â€”No, I have not.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",90
"91","41555. Is it not the fact that the recent returns of the census show there has been of late years a tendency from all rural districts to gravitate into centres of industry, from one end of the country to the other?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",91
"92","â€”Yes, there is, but I think it is particularly so in the Highlands.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",92
"93","41556. Then have you ever taken the trouble to compare the poor rates of Inverness, or its general circumstances, with other towns, so as to ascertain as a fact whether the tendency has been more or less in Inverness to gravitate to the town than it is in other parts of the country?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",93
"94","â€”No, I have not ascertained that from comparison of the poor rates, but from various other sources I am perfectly satisfied that it is so,â€”from the opinions so freely expressed by those who ought to know something about the matter.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",94
"95","41557. What I mean is that you might on investigation ascertain that the proportion of people who have migrated to Inverness is pretty much the same as it has been to other large towns both in England and Scotland, neither greater nor less?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",95
"96","â€”That may be so.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",96
"97","41558. But, so far as you are concerned, it is as yet an unascertained fact whether the proportion has been greater in Inverness than any other large towns?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",97
"98","â€”Yes.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",98
"99","41559. The Chairman.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",99
"100","â€”I would like to ask you a question which I might more properly have done before. In what degree do merchants and traders, persons in your position here, depend upon the custom of shooting tenants and tourists, and other external sources of consumption, and in what degree do they depend upon local demandâ€”on the residents in the country? I mean, does the custom of strangers of all classes, both tenants and tourists, form a very great element in your trade?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",100
"101","â€”Speaking for merchants generally throughout the town, I may say that we depend very largely upon the permaneut rural population throughout the country. There are one or two individuals in the town who devote their attention to the applying of shooting tenants, but I think this of itself is decreasing nowâ€”this department of tradeâ€”because I am informed by those merchants who do that sort of business that the shooting tenants coming from the south supply themselves very largely with what they require from large stores in London and other large places, and bring all the supplies with them, which they used twenty or thirty years ago to buy in Inverness, so we are perhaps less than ever dependent upon these people.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",101
"102","41560. You think that if the custom of the shooting tenants, and persons who hire places and lands for various purposes here, were struck out, it would make no material difference to the trade of the town?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",102
"103","â€”I think it would be fully made up if there was substituted for it the custom arising from the people who would settle down upon the land that they have now.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",103
"104","41561. Mr Cameron.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",104
"105","â€”What do you mean by settling down upon the land they occupy now, because the shooting tenants shoot over land already occupied by farmers, except in the case of deer forests?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",105
"106","â€”I was referring to deer forests.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",106
"107","41562. I think the Chairman's question referred both to sporting tenants and tourists as well?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",107
"108","â€”From the changes that are proposed I do not suppose for a moment that the tourist traffic in the Highlands would decrease. I think it would increase, because the country would be much more open to them than it is now, because you have restrictions here and there that are rather a barrier to tourists.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",108
"109","41563. You make the statement you have just made, not as a personal one, I understand, but as so far representing the trading community of Inverness. You think that is their opinion as well as your own?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",109
"110","â€”Yes, I do.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",110
"111","41564. To go a step farther, do you think the tradesmen of Inverness have derived any benefit from all the shooting lodges that have been built?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",111
"112","â€”Certainly there has been a great deal of benefit derived from those shooting lodges and their surroundings.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",112
"113","41565. I suppose a large proportion of the shooting lodges have been built and constructed in the various departments by tradesmen and work people employed by those tradesmen situated in Inverness?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",113
"114","â€”I should think so.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",114
"115","41566. It must have given a good deal of employment to masons, carpenters, joiners, plumbers, and contractors?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",115
"116","â€”It must have done so.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",116
"117","41567. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",117
"118","â€”To clear up this a little about the position of the merchants and shooting people, I presume, with regard to such things for instance as butcher meat, fresh meat, poultry, eggs, and so on, of course the shooting tenants do benefit the people in the country, and perhaps the people in the town?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",118
"119","â€”Undoubtedly, in very many ways.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",119
"120","41568. What you refer to more are groceries, cloth, and things of that kind?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",120
"121","â€”Exactly.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",121
"122","41569. Those are all brought here by the strangers?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",122
"123","â€”Yes.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",123
"124","41570. Mr Cameron.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",124
"125","â€”Shooting tenants do not buy their Highland tweeds in London rather than in Mr Macdougalls?",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",125
"126","â€”Yes, but they require more than Highland tweeds.",689,"John Macdonald","Inverness, ",126
