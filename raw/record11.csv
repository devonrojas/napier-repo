"1","JOHN M'INTYRE, Crofter and Missionary, Sconser—examined. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",1
"2","593. The Chairman.",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",2
"3","—Will you describe to us the condition of the place where you live, and the hardships and grievances which the people suffer or are alleged to suffer, particularly in connection with the deer forest ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",3
"4","—The principal grievances of which they complain are the smallness of their holdings, the want of sheep on their common grazing, and the way in which their crops are yearly destroyed by deer. That destruction is not so much now for the past two or three years owing to the present factor's liberality in repairing the fence about the township. They complain very much of the way in which people from other townships—removed for the sake of enlarging the deer forest—have been crammed upon them, abiding so many to the already too thickly peopled townships. They thinkit is the poorest township in the parish, and especially owing to its connection with the deer forest. They complain much of the way in which they are dealt with by the gamekeepers. They are strongly under the impression that the gamekeepers are far more severe than their instructions from their superiors allow them to be. They blame the gamekeepers most for all the ills they suffer. The remedies they are anxious for in the meantime are, that they get the liberty of keeping sheep upon the common grazing, larger holdings at a fair rent, and fixity of tenure, so that the proprietor cannot remove them without just cause, such as being so many years in arrears of rent. That is all I am instructed to inform the commissioners.",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",4
"5","594. Might I ask whether you have yourself personally witnessed the ravages caused by the deer among the growing crops ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",5
"6","—Yes.",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",6
"7","595. If the proprietors were disposed to give to the people larger holdings of arable ground, is there available ground in the vicinity which could be given to them ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",7
"8","—Yes.",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",8
"9","596. Would it be possible to put a wire fence round the crofters' pasture so as to protect the pasture from the incursions of sheep and deer and enable them to keep their own sheep upon it ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",9
"10","—Yes, but at a great deal of expense, which the crofters are not able to pay.",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",10
"11","597. What would be the extent of the wire fence necessary fur the protection of the common pasture ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",11
"12","—About 3 miles. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",12
"13","598. If such a fence could be put up, and the wandering sheep and deer excluded, would that give great satisfaction to the crofters ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",13
"14","—Yes. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",14
"15","599. Would an ordinary wire fence of six or seven wires in a great measure exclude the deer, or would the deer pass over it ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",15
"16","—In some cases the deer would pass over such a fence. Round the arable land there is at present a fence of seven wires and the deer in some cases get over it, and they are so vicious—more so than deer I see anywhere else—that they twist themselves between the wires so as to get into the corn. I have seen it with my own eyes. They go on their sides to get in between the wires—especially the hinds. I never saw stags doing it. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",16
"17","600. Are the houses of the place more than usually bad ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",17
"18","—They are very bad. Some of them are about the usual style of houses in the island. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",18
"19","601. Do you attribute the present prevalence of fever in any degree to the bad houses ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",19
"20","—I could hardly answer that. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",20
"21","602. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",21
"22","—What kind of fever is it?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",22
"23","—Typhoid. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",23
"24","603. Mr Cameron.",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",24
"25","—You said the factor had repaired the wire fence for the crofters. What sized fence was that?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",25
"26","—The wire fence that was formerly round the cultivated land. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",26
"27","604. Was that a fence that would keep out sheep and deer from your own pasture ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",27
"28","—It was very well for keeping out the deer from the pasture. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",28
"29","605. Was that the fence you spoke of which was 3 miles long?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",29
"30","— No. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",30
"31","606. An inside fence ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",31
"32","—Yes. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",32
"33","607.. But an outside fence including your pasture would require to be 3 miles long ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",33
"34","—Yes. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",34
"35","608. Have you ever seen a deer fence ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",35
"36","—Yes. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",36
"37","609. What height do you consider sufficient to keep out deer ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",37
"38","—They are not the same height in all places. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",38
"39","610. Where did you see this fence?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",39
"40","—At a place called Cluny, in the possession of Earl Cowper. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",40
"41","611. How many miles long was it?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",41
"42","—I cannot say. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",42
"43","612. Was it sufficient for its purpose ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",43
"44","—It was sufficient. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",44
"45","613. Was it about 6 feet ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",45
"46","—Between 6 and 7 feet. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",46
"47","614. Do you think 6 or 7 feet should be enough ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",47
"48","—It should. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",48
"49","615. Do you know anything about any other deer forest in Scotland?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",49
"50","—Yes. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",50
"51","616. Have you ever heard heard that fences have been erected in other forests ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",51
"52","—Yes. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",52
"53","617. And of much greater length than you talk of here?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",53
"54","—Yes. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",54
"55","618. In fact, there would be practically no difficulty except finding money to make a 3 mile fence ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",55
"56","—That is all. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",56
"57","619. Has any application ever been made to the proprietor or factor to make this fence?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",57
"58","—I do not think so. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",58
"59","620. If it were made quite efficient, I suppose it would remove all the grievances about the deer eating the crop?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",59
"60","—Yes, it would. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",60
"61","621. Does the gamekeeper annoy you by shooting your dogs?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",61
"62","—He did; not now. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",62
"63","622. Cats ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",63
"64","—Not cats. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",64
"65","623. Does he annoy you in any other way?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",65
"66","—Yes, in many a way. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",66
"67","624. In what sort of way?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",67
"68","—In preventing people taking thatch out of the forest. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",68
"69","625. Do they have to go far into the forest to take thatch?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",69
"70","—Yes. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",70
"71","626. How far?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",71
"72","—In some cases a mile or more. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",72
"73","627. Is there anywhere else they can get thatch?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",73
"74","—No; and it is a thing very much used in the district to keep thatch on the houses, and they are not allowed to cut it in the forest. They are allowed in a certain part of the forest, but they cannot get all they require, because the Braes and Sconser people get all their thatch from that forest. There is a certain part of the forest put out to them to get thatching, but it is not near enough to supply all. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",74
"75","628. Is there any other grievance they have against the gamekeeper except not allowing them to get thatch?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",75
"76","—Not that I am aware of just now. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",76
"77","629. So, if you had these three miles of fence you would have no grievance against either the shooting tenant or the gamekeeper, with the exception of the difficulty of getting thatch ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",77
"78","—No, not the least. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",78
"79","630. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",79
"80","—As to this fence which was repaired by the present factor, how long is it since it was first put up ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",80
"81","—Fifteen or sixteen years ago. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",81
"82","631. And I suppose when it was first put up it was a benefit ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",82
"83","—I do not think it was ever a benefit. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",83
"84","632. But it is now ?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",84
"85","—No, it is not. It did a little help last year, but not to the extent necessary. ",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",85
"86","633. Was it never repaired in those twelve years?",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",86
"87","—No, until the present factor came in.",11,"John Mcintyre","Skye, Braes",87
