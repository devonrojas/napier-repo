"1","DUGALD MACLACHLAN, Bank Agent and Clerk of Court at Portree (41)—examined.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",1
"2","9935. Professor Mackinnon.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",2
"3","—How long have you been in Skye?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",3
"4","—I came to Skye in 1856, and since then I have been resident in Skye, except for about six years, when I was abroad.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",4
"5","9936. So you have known Skye almost all your life?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",5
"6","—I may say I have.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",6
"7","9937. And of late years you have known the whole island?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",7
"8","—Yes, pretty much.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",8
"9","9938. And the condition of the people?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",9
"10","—Yes, generally.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",10
"11","9939. Especially those of the crofting class?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",11
"12","—Yes, I may say I know a good deal of their condition.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",12
"13","9940. I need not ask you if you have read the evidence, for you heard it all. Do you agree in the main with the description which the delegates of the crofters throughout Skye have given of their own condition?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",13
"14","—Yes, I do, most certainly.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",14
"15","9941. You believe it is a fair statement of their condition?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",15
"16","—I believe that their condition is very poor as a rule —that they live from hand to mouth.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",16
"17","9942. And even putting last year out of question, that it is getting poorer?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",17
"18","—I must say that is my impression. They cannot stand a bad year. When a bad year comes they go to the wall at once.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",18
"19","9943. The main cause which they themselves give as accounting for that state of matters is the small holdings?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",19
"20","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",20
"21","9944. Do you agree with that?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",21
"22","—Yes, I do, so far as my knowledge enables me to judge.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",22
"23","9945. You believe that is the main cause of it all?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",23
"24","—Yes, I do.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",24
"25","9946. And almost the sole remedy that they themselves suggested was to increase these holdings?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",25
"26","—To increase these holdings. I may say that I am an emigration agent, and I have the honour of representing the colony of Queensland in this country as emigration agent. I have heard the opinions of the crofters on the subject of emigration, and, of course, there is but very little inclination that way.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",26
"27","9947. You have heard them express their opinions among themselves for a number of years past?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",27
"28","—I have.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",28
"29","9948. Putting it broadly, were the opinions which they have expressed in this inquiry much to the same effect as those you have heard for some years back?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",29
"30","—Very much, except as to some of their petty grievances which have come out here.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",30
"31","9949. But the great cause of the distress, and the great remedy for it, which they expressed here, they have been in the habit of expressing pretty generally from year to year?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",31
"32","—Yes, for a long time past.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",32
"33","9950. Do you yourself agree that if it was practicable to increase these holdings such a scheme would reasonably be expected to remove at least a part of the present distress?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",33
"34","—I think so, certainly.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",34
"35","9951. Of course, we all know there is plenty of land in Skye to give the people enlarged holdings; but have you considered the question of framing a practicable scheme, supposing it were agreed upon?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",35
"36","—Well, it is a subject upon which all of us have been thinking for these last years —we who live by dealing with the producers of wealth in the country —and it is a very serious problem. ",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",36
"37","9952. What solution of the problem would you be prepared to recommend, to make it practicable for them to acquire larger holdings?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",37
"38","—Generally speaking, the crofters themselves—a very large number, at all events— would not be able to stock these holdings, but there are many of them no doubt who would be able to stock very considerable holdings. But the difficulty would remain, what to do with those who are not able. In the course of applying the remedy of increased holdings, there is no doubt the landlord's interest would have to be taken into account, and conserved out of some fund or other, and also that the tenant should be helped to stock these larger holdings. So far as I personally am concerned, my opinion is that there is a fund just now in existence which is of very little service in many parts of the Highlands, and which could profitably be applied in that way, both to enable the tenant to stock his holding and to compensate the proprietor for any loss.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",38
"39","9953. Have you any objection to name that fund?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",39
"40","—I may as well come out with it; it is the funds of the Established Church. I think it would be very much better to apply them to that purpose than to keep them as they are. I think it would be a very great privilege that Christians should be enabled to pay for their own religion.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",40
"41","9954. It would be a natural question to ask, whether those who have undertaken to pay for their own religion in this part of the country are able to pay for it, but we had better not pursue that?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",41
"42","—Yes, they do that, because those who pay for religion here are mostly of the class to which our Saviour called attention when he saw the widow casting her mites into the treasury. They are those who would share their last mite for the cause of Christ.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",42
"43","9955. I suppose you would not think of taking the funds belonging to the Church itself. That would be reserved for the State to put it on the proper footing?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",43
"44","—Well, though I have come out here in that way, I have not fully considered the scheme. The fund is there —the money is there —and what we say in the Highlands generally is that it might be much better applied.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",44
"45","9956. Have you considered to what extent that remedy would be sufficient for Skye?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",45
"46","—No, but I know it would be sufficient to a very considerable extent.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",46
"47","9957. In the first place, there are a good number of crofters who would be able themselves to stock crofts?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",47
"48","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",48
"49","9958. In the second place, there are some who would require a good deal of assistance?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",49
"50","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",50
"51","9959. Now, supposing you capitalised the whole ecclesiastical revenue of Skye, would you exhaust it all?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",51
"52","—I cannot say; that is a matter of calculation.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",52
"53","9960. The Chairman.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",53
"54","—Then would you make a rapid calculation? ",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",54
"55","—Perhaps the funds of the Established Church in Skye may be worth some £3000 a year.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",55
"56","—[Rev. Mr Darroch. Not half of it ]That is between the value of the glebes and the stipends.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",56
"57","9961. Professor Mackinnon.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",57
"58","—What is the average value of the livings of the Established Church in this island—£350 a year?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",58
"59","—No, I would not say that.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",59
"60","9962. £300?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",60
"61","—Perhaps £250 or £300.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",61
"62","9963. With the glebe?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",62
"63","—With the glebe it might be £350.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",63
"64","9964. How many livings are there?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",64
"65","—Nine.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",65
"66","9965. That is £3150. Multiplying that by 25, it brings out £78,750. So far as that goes, there would be no interest to be paid back upon it?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",66
"67","—No.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",67
"68","9966. How would you distribute it? Would not those who are decently well off require their share of it as well as those who are not?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",68
"69","—Possibly.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",69
"70","9967. It would be a capitation grant ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",70
"71","—It would be very difficult to judge who was able and who was not, because you could scarcely pry into the private affairs of each crofter.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",71
"72","9968. Would you not compel any one, before you gave him assistance, to make some statement of his affairs?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",72
"73","—I would not be prepared all at once to go into the details of the method of applying the scheme, but I only state broadly that that appears to me to be a fund which ought to be made available for some useful public purpose, and let the good people of the Established Church, who compose, generally speaking, in this country the wealthiest portion of the community, have the privilege of paying for their own Church.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",73
"74","9969. There was a great deal said about the conditions on which these enlarged holdings should be given to the people. Have you formed an idea in your own mind what reasonable conditions should be imposed?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",74
"75","—Of course, we repeat the parrot cry of fixity of tenure.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",75
"76","9970. What is meant by that?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",76
"77","—Just that the tenant should not be removed at the will of the landlord, so long as he paid his rent, and a fair rent.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",77
"78","9971. How would the rent be determined?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",78
"79","—By some neutral party.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",79
"80","9972. And revalued how often?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",80
"81","—Very much on the lines of the Irish Land Bill, namely, once in every fifteen years. There is practically such a valuation periodically now in the country. We know it by the name of summing. That amounts to the same thing. ",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",81
"82","9973. And so long as the tenant pays his rent, he is not to be removed?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",82
"83","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",83
"84","9974. I asked a question of a gentleman before about the right of succession to such a croft. Have you anything to say upon that subject? Would you allow the croft to descend from father to son?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",84
"85","—Yes, I should certainly think so.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",85
"86","9975. Would the one who was allowed to succeed be obliged to buy out the rest of the family?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",86
"87","—Yes, I should think so.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",87
"88","9976. You would on no account subdivide the croft?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",88
"89","—No; I would certainly be against subdivision.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",89
"90","9977. And if he was unable to buy out the rest, what then?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",90
"91","—It would be subject to the rules of the market.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",91
"92","9978. Would it become the proprietor's?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",92
"93","—I suppose then it would come into public competition. Some other crofter might be got to take it.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",93
"94","9979. Would you say that the tenant might then be entitled to sell it to the highest bidder?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",94
"95","—I would rather be afraid to adopt such a plan, because it might end in the same state of matters of which we are now complaining. It might end in such high rents being exacted as would induce the distress of which we are now complaining.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",95
"96","9980. What is the minimum croft you would make under this scheme?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",96
"97","—These are really matters which are pretty much outside my business.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",97
"98","9981. You have given a good deal of attention to the matter?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",98
"99","—I could not help doing that, because I come so much in contact with the people who are principally interested.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",99
"100","9982. What would be the amount of stock you would have upon the lowest sized croft?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",100
"101","—I would not believe much in crofts which were not of sufficient size to enable a family to live in comfort, and I would say that such a croft would be one upon which a tenant could keep six cows, thirty to forty or fifty sheep, and a horse, with perhaps twenty to thirty acres of arable land. I have been considering the matter, and of course I speak very much from hearsay, but I have had the opinion of a very considerable number of crofters as to the kind of croft they would consider a comfortable croft, and though my figures are at second hand, I may say that just about an hour ago I took the figures which I have now given from a crofter of very great experience and knowledge. His idea of a good croft, as I have said, is twenty acres arable, with a stock of six cows, one horse, and fifty sheep.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",101
"102","9983. And the rent would be fixed by a valuator?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",102
"103","—The rent would be fixed by a valuator, and would amount to a certain proportion of the profits of the croft.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",103
"104","9981. Then you would have the arable ground fenced off, I presume, in a croft of that size?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",104
"105","—I should think so.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",105
"106","9985. And the hill pasture might be worked upon the club system?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",106
"107","—I think so.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",107
"108","9986. These figures would be the minimum croft, but you would have a gradation right up?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",108
"109","—I would have a gradation right up to the peasant proprietor. I would like to see the path opened up to the Highlander not only to work a comfortably sized croft with profit and comfort to himself, but to work himself into the proprietorship of it.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",109
"110","9987. I understand your claim to fixity of tenure practically meant that?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",110
"111","—Practically it does.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",111
"112","9988. But you would not confine all the crofts to much the same size?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",112
"113","—Would you not allow a gradation among them, so that a man might be able to get one, two, or three times as big a croft as you have mentioned? ",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",113
"114","—I think so.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",114
"115","9989. And still leave large farms in the country?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",115
"116","—Oh, there ought to be plenty of room in Skye for sufficiently large farms as well as for the accommodation and comfortable living of a very great number of small farmers, and that is what we desiderate in the country.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",116
"117","9990. Do you think there is a sufficient amount of available land in Skye at the present moment to make such a scheme as that feasible with its present population?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",117
"118","—That is a question of statistics and calculation into which I have not gone, but there is no doubt that any one who goes along the roads in Skye and looks right and left must see immense tracts of country which are suitable for the occupancy of small farmers. You see them uninhabited by human beings.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",118
"119","9991. Don't you think that for such a scheme as that the present population is too large?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",119
"120","—Possibly it may be.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",120
"121","9992. What would you do with the overplus?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",121
"122","—I have heard of a scheme of emigration. I would certainly encourage those who are willing to emigrate, but I would be very sorry indeed to see the people emigrate.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",122
"123","9993. Even although you are an emigration agent?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",123
"124","—Yes, I think it would be a loss to the kingdom, for a more loyal set of subjects could not be found.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",124
"125","9994. At the same time, of course, you know perfectly well that, under any conditions whatsoever, in a place like this there must always be an overflow of people?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",125
"126","—I would like to see the country so comfortable as that there would be just a natural outflow of people to the waste places of the world, to accomplish what Providence seems to be in course of",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",126
"127","Accomplishing —giving the government of the world to this nation, to the English-speaking people.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",127
"128","9995. But don't you think there is room at this moment for several Skye men to go and occupy waste places elsewhere?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",128
"129","—Yes, there is plenty of room in foreign countries.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",129
"130","9996. So, even if your scheme were practicable at home, it would be necessary to carry on the other scheme along with it from the present time?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",130
"131","—Yes, I would certainly agree to the promotion of a scheme of emigration, which would enable those who are so minded, and who consider it better for them to leave the country, to do so, but hand in hand with that I should like to see an effort made by the legislature to provide comfortable livings, and to see to it that the people in the country have elbow room at home.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",131
"132","9997. You spoke of those who were so minded, but would it not require to be compulsory?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",132
"133","—Oh, dear no; don't speak of compulsion.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",133
"134","9998. On your scheme of the future, where would you put the people if the crofts were not subdivided?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",134
"135","—If they saw there was no room at home, they would fast enough go abroad.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",135
"136","9999. It does not look like it just now?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",136
"137","—We have had several reasons for that. The people are so poor that they must go to Glasgow and the south, or to the fishing, to earn money for their families. They cannot go far; they must always remain, as it were, in sight of home.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",137
"138","10000. Has it not been the case that hitherto poverty at home was the great motive power for emigration over the world, and that people emigrated more largely when ill off than when wealthy?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",138
"139","—Yes, certainly.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",139
"140","10001. How can you expect then that in the future people will voluntarily go away when they are comfortable, and will not allow the crofts to be subdivided?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",140
"141","—My idea is that if the sons of the family were so numerous that they could afford an overplus when they saw their people comfortable at home, they could, without any reluctance or compunction, leave the old folks, and go and cut out a living for themselves elsewhere.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",141
"142","10002. Just as you see in Skye and elsewhere at present, in the case of people who are comfortably off, that the families scatter easily?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",142
"143","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",143
"144","10003. Do you think that the sole cause of the objection to emigrate on the part of those who are not so well off is that they wish to remain at home in order to attend to their parents?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",144
"145","—I don't say that is the sole reason, but it is a very powerful reason.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",145
"146","10004. Do you think it is the chief reason?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",146
"147","—I might almost say it is. The ties of affection are very strong amongst Highland families, and they",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",147
"148","especially love their native soil.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",148
"149","10005. Is that not the case when they are well off just as when they are badly off?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",149
"150","—Yes, but when they picture the old people in misery lying on the straw at night, and covered with meal bags instead of blankets, they cannot have the heart to go very far from home.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",150
"151","10006. Don't you think there ought to be some among them that would say, Rather than lie along with them in that way, I would emigrate and 1 send home to them the price of a blanket?'",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",151
"152","—Well, they ought certainly.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",152
"153","10007. But you suggest that if they were becoming more comfortable the people themselves would work out the problem by going away?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",153
"154","—Yes, I say so. When I speak about meal bags, I don't mean every case, but I speak of instances of which I have had believable testimony on one or two properties in Skye. Certainly it is not the case on other properties that I know.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",154
"155","10008. Have you paid much attention to the education of the district under the administration of the Act of 1872?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",155
"156","—No, not very much.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",156
"157","10009. We all understand that the education of the island has not been taken advantage of so much as one would wish, but is it your belief that there are a greater number of children receiving elementary education here than was the case thirteen or fourteen years ago?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",157
"158","—I believe so, but there are people who are better able to judge of that than I am. I know that within my short memory in Portree, say fifteen or twenty years ago, the number of children attending school in Portree was very much smaller than it is now.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",158
"159","10010. But it is admitted that the compulsory clause of the Education Act has not been worked so successfully in Skye as we might reasonably expect ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",159
"160","—No.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",160
"161","10011. Are you able to suggest any remedy by which matters might be improved in that respect?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",161
"162","—I hear people who ought to know complaining of the action of some school boards —that they are too stingy with their salaries, and don't encourage a proper class of teachers.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",162
"163","10012. The buildings are excellent at any rate?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",163
"164","—The buildings are excellent, but you will never get a proper teacher without offering an inducing salary.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",164
"165","10013. There was a statement made to-day upon which I should like to ask your opinion as a banker, but I am not very sure whether you feel yourself entitled to speak about it. From your knowledge as a banker, are you able to give us the benefit of that knowledge as to the circumstances of the people ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",165
"166","—To a certain extent I am.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",166
"167","10014. Mr Macdonald, Tormore, in part of his evidence, without making a specific statement, so far as I understood him, left upon us the impression—and I thought it was meant we should have the impression —that a large number of deposits in the banks in Portree, amounting, as he supposed, to something like £200,000, must be in the name of the crofter class, because he supposed the proprietors would not, or could not, deposit there, and that the large tacksmen did not, and therefore it was left to be inferred that the great proportion belonged to the crofter class. Can you confirm that statement?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",167
"168","—I cannot by any means; he is under a very great mistake.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",168
"169","10015. Of course, if I found any reason to believe it was the case, I could almost see my way to your scheme being worked out without trenching on the funds of the Established Church?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",169
"170","—Oh no, I don't see it.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",170
"171","10016. You don't see how you could do without the funds of the church ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",171
"172","—I don't see it.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",172
"173","10017. So far as the means of the crofters, to the best of your knowledge, are concerned ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",173
"174","—No, I don't think it. There may be a good proportion of the crofters who might be able to provide stock.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",174
"175","10018. You believe there are a considerable number who would be able to take a croft if they got it, and others who would require more or less assistance ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",175
"176","—Quite so.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",176
"177","10019. But still a large margin who simply could not?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",177
"178","—Who simply could not.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",178
"179","10020. Who have nothing?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",179
"180","—And worse than nothing, as we have heard.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",180
"181","10021. In that respect you generally concur with and back up the statements that were made by the delegates of the crofters themselves ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",181
"182","—Yes, upon the whole. The crofters on the north end of the island are worse off, I believe, than the crofters anywhere else on the island,",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",182
"183","10022. That was attributed to the system of bills that was carried on. Did you observe in one of the papers that the banks were said to charge 10 to 15 per cent. ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",183
"184","—Yes, and that is a complete mistake.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",184
"185","10023. The ordinary rate is charged, and that is all ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",185
"186","—The ordinary rate, as fixed by the Council of Bankers in Edinburgh.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",186
"187","10024. And the difference between that and 10 or 15 per cent, is charged by another person?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",187
"188","—10 or 15 per cent, is never charged. As I understand the evidence of the delegate referred to —when he spoke of 2s., 2s. 6d., and 3s. being charged for accommodation bills, that referred entirely to what the securities charged, which was beyond the knowledge of the bank agent, though he might by a round-about way come to know that there was something charged. There was another delegate of whom the question was asked, in that end of the courtly, what interest was generally paid to the banks, and he said about 5 percent., or Is. in the £.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",188
"189","10025. The interest to the bank is the ordinary discount rate?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",189
"190","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",190
"191","10026. And this 10 to 15 per cent, if it exists at all, is paid to quite different parties?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",191
"192","—Yes, it is an outside transaction between themselves, with which the bank agent has nothing to do at all.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",192
"193","10027. Mr Cameron.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",193
"194","—Do you consider that the actual rents paid by the crofters in Skye are high, or the reverse?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",194
"195","—I judge very much by hearsay, and we have heard a good number of them say they would rather pay",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",195
"196","three times what they pay for a croft three times the present size than be on the present croft, though they should get it for nothing.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",196
"197","10028. That is hardly an answer to my inquiry, because nobody could have a croft for nothing. Taking the value of the land and the produce got out of it, do you consider that the present rents are too high, taking them all over?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",197
"198","—I think that the rent which the proprietor might, under present circumstances, reasonably expect would be too high to charge a crofter, and I think for the difference there ought to be some way of compensating him. Although in Skye here we may be credited with advanced ideas on the land question, we never would dream of advocating a policy of spoliation of the landlords. We wish to repudiate that most sincerely.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",198
"199","10029. Then you would not be apprehensive that, under a system of valuation by a neutral person, the rents might be raised beyond what they are now?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",199
"200","—No, I would not. I see that the same system is adopted under the Irish Land Bill, and I don't see why it should not work successfully in this country,",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",200
"201","10030. That, of course, would depend upon the rents not being too high?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",201
"202","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",202
"203","10031. Supposing that the rents were not too high in this country, but very moderate, would you feel any apprehension that under the system you propose, instead of being decreased, they might be increased?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",203
"204","—I don't think they would be increased.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",204
"205","—[Mr Alexander Macdonald. I just wish to say one word about the banks and deposits—namely, that no person in Skye, I believe, can tell the amount of deposits in the banks. I don't know myself, though I am agent for one of them. Mr Maclachlan is agent for another, and he does not know; and Mr Skene is agent for another, and he does not know. We all keep our own secrets, and no one in Skye has the slightest idea of the amount of deposits in the three banks].",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",205
"206","10032. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",206
"207","—You propose to adopt fixity of tenure. Do you mean to adopt it before the crofts are enlarged, or to confirm the present state of things?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",207
"208","—The present state of things, with enlarged holdings.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",208
"209","10033. But with the holdings as they are, do you wish to establish fixity of tenure?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",209
"210","—I would wish that it should not be in the power of the laird or factor arbitrarily to evict any man so long as he paid his rent.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",210
"211","10034. Even with the present small holdings?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",211
"212","—Yes, most certainly, even with the present small holdings. If an eviction took place, I should like to see it carried out in the same way in which I saw it carried out in the property of Mr Macdonald at Skeabost, which was done in a proper spirit and in a proper form. There was a tenant in the township who made himself very disagreeable to the rest of them, and the whole of the township joined in a petition to the landlord to have him removed, and the landlord gave effect to their desire.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",212
"213","10035. If you had fixity of tenure, of course you could not have removals?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",213
"214","—No.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",214
"215","10036. In regard to the school salaries, you said that the salaries in Skye are very low?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",215
"216","—Yes, I hear the complaint general.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",216
"217","10037. Do you think that tends towards making the education given here inefficient in character?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",217
"218","—Well, it tends in many instances to keep schools vacant for months in the year. ",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",218
"219","10038. And not to procure the best class of teacher to fill them?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",219
"220","—Yes, certainly. ",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",220
"221","10039. And probably the children don't make make same progress under these second-class teachers?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",221
"222","—I believe it would be the cheapest way to employ a good teacher at first, and so earn a larger amount of grant.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",222
"223","10040. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",223
"224","—You have the records of the sheriff court under your charge, I believe?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",224
"225","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",225
"226","10041. Have you prepared a list of the decrees of the court for some time back?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",226
"227","—I attempted to do it, but it involved so much work that I have not been able to complete it.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",227
"228","10042. Will you make up and hand in a correct statement?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",228
"229","—I will. I should like to verify it before giving it in. I have made up a list of decrees of removal from agricultural small holdings since 1810.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",229
"230","10043. You will hand it in to the Commission by-and-by?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",230
"231","—Yes, when I have verified it to the best of my knowledge.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",231
"232","10044. Mr Cameron.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",232
"233","—Will the date of each be mentioned?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",233
"234","—Each year.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",234
"235","10045. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",235
"236","—What number do they amount to?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",236
"237","—Roughly, they amount to 2046 decrees of removal proceeding upon summonses of removal. (see Appendix A. XXIII.)",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",237
"238","10046. Are these extracted?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",238
"239","—They are extractable decrees. They may not have been extracted. It cannot be known to what extent these decrees were acted on.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",239
"240","10047. Professor Mackinnon.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",240
"241","—Is that what we popularly call a warning?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",241
"242","—Yes, a warning against the tenant, and the decree is the sheriff's authority granted upon it.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",242
"243","10048. Do you add to that the number that were enforced?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",243
"244","—I cannot. I have been asked simply to give this information —the number of decrees of removal since 1840.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",244
"245","10049. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",245
"246","—You have walked and driven about the island, and seen a good deal of Skye?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",246
"247","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",247
"248","10050. Can you confirm what many delegates have stated, that the pasture is deteriorating in many places?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",248
"249","—Yes, both from my own judgment, so far as it goes, and from the opinion of men of practical experience.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",249
"250","10051. When you were going about the island you have seen what enables you to corroborate what has been stated here —that there are hundreds of ruined houses?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",250
"251","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",251
"252","10052. You can also confirm this, that the people have been crowded into confined areas?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",252
"253","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",253
"254","10053. And that in consequence subdivision has occurred?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",254
"255","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",255
"256","10054. Suppose the crofts were enlarged as you propose, would there not be a much larger trade carried on in the island?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",256
"257","—Very much larger; that is what we desire.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",257
"258","10055. And lawyers and bankers and everybody else would be benefited ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",258
"259","—Yes, every class of people who thrive by dealing with the wealth-producers of the country.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",259
"260","10056. Were you present when Mr Baird of Knoydart was examined?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",260
"261","—No.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",261
"262","10057. Because he stated that he would not take any farmers for his big farms who were non-resident. I suppose that some of the Skye proprietors are finding it to be well to take that step in advance and to have resident farmers as much as possible?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",262
"263","—There are just three that are non-resident.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",263
"264","10058. But these are pretty large?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",264
"265","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",265
"266","10059. We have heard of the large farm of Scorrybreck. Have there been a great number of people removed from that farm at times?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",266
"267","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",267
"268","10060. The tenant himself stated that the extent of that farm was eleven miles, but does he not rather minimise the extent of it?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",268
"269","—I hear it spoken of as fifteen miles in extent.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",269
"270","10061. You think eleven is rather under the mark?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",270
"271","—I think so. I have always heard it spoken of as having fourteen miles of sea coast",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",271
"272","10062. And that includes bays?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",272
"273","—If you followed it out and in you might make it almost as long as from here to Stornoway.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",273
"274","10063. Then you mean in a straight line?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",274
"275","—Generally.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",275
"276","10064. Are you aware of any inconvenience that occurs to the people of Skye from there being only two practising agents in the court?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",276
"277","—I really cannot say there is.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",277
"278","10005. Have people complained to you as an official of the court and asked your advice, or anything of that kind?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",278
"279","—I cannot say.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",279
"280","10066. Then it is not a grievance?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",280
"281","—I cannot really say it is. The court business has diminished very much of late. People are getting to be more sensible and less litigious. There used to be a time when there was an immense amount of business done in the court here. Now that is not the case. The introduction of the Debts Recovery Act and of the Small Debts Act has tended very much to decrease litigation.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",281
"282","10067. We find in many cases a repugnance on the part of the people to take leases. Can you explain that?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",282
"283","—The impression they gave me is that they don't want leases to give them connection with the soil. They consider that necessary with strangers, to give them an introduction to the land, but they say, 'We are here already, and we don't want that.' ",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",283
"284","10068. Is that the only account you can give of that repugnance?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",284
"285","—I think so ; at least except in so far as regards agreements that might be entered into as to the mode of cultivating the soil.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",285
"286","10069. Would you give us your opinion as to the general conduct and behaviour of the people and their character? They are accused of being indolent and lazy, and of not working sufficiently?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",286
"287","—I daresay that the Highlanders, as agriculturists, may with a considerable amount of truth be charged with laziness, but I believe it is not their fault. It is the fault of the conditions that have been imposed upon them by the legislature, for their condition seems to be such that there appears to be a premium upon laziness, because they see instances, such as that of Donald Nicolson, Totescore, who was arbitrarily cleared out of his possession, and although there should be only one such case occurring in a decade, it gets wind all round, and every person feels that he may be treated in the same way if a neighbouring sheep farmer should happen to offer a pound of rent more than he is able to pay, and his sense of insecurity is such that his energies are depressed.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",287
"288","10070. If they had proper inducements, do you think they would work as well in Skye as they work in the south?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",288
"289","—Most decidedly.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",289
"290","10071. In speaking of the enlarged crofts for crofters, the only question always comes up as a difficulty, but don't you think that a young, strong man, willing to work, really has his capital in his two hands?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",290
"291","—That is his capital; his bodily health is his capital.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",291
"292","10072. Is that not a very good capital?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",292
"293","—That is a most important capital.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",293
"294","10073. Might it not really be of more importance to a man to be strong and healthy than to be somewhat weakly and in possession of £100 or £150?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",294
"295","—There is no use of a crofter undertaking the cultivation of a croft even if he had the money, if he has not physical health to work it, because he simply hands over the profit of the croft to another man.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",295
"296","10074. Considering the hard times which the people in Skye have generally passed through, what do you say as to their behaviour?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",296
"297","—It has been most exemplary. Such a thing as agrarian outrage is utterly unknown. ",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",297
"298","10075. It was mentioned to-day by Tormore that the agitation only began recently. How long is it since this agitation and movement of discontent began?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",298
"299","—In my experience, the first active expression of discontent and rebellion against the rents in Skye took place on Captain Fraser's property very early after he got the property.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",299
"300","10076. Even so far back?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",300
"301","—Yes, very shortly after he got the property.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",301
"302","10077. And that is some twenty years ago?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",302
"303","—Yes, fully that.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",303
"304","10078. Do you think that the successive increases of rent which he put upon his estate still kept up agitation?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",304
"305","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",305
"306","10079. Then it cannot be considered a thing of to-day?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",306
"307","—No, and it is certainly not attributable to Irish agitators. The next active rebellion was when Mr G. G. Mackay of Raasay took to improving his estate, and carried out some removals. He sent an officer with summonses of removal, and I believe the officer crossed the ferry, but he had some difficulty in returning, for his boat was not to be found. Then came the agitation on Captain Fraser's property, in the case of Valtos, about three years ago. He came to see that he was in the wrong and that he had been overcharging them for a number of years; but the discontent has been fomented on Captain Fraser's estate in Skye—no doubt about that.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",307
"308","10080. Then there are some parts of Skye better off than others?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",308
"309","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",309
"310","10081. The district of Sleat?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",310
"311","—I would rather not particularise. As to the character of the people, I was asked to give some statistics of the emigration which took place some years ago, but I have not been able to get these with any degree of accuracy ; but in hunting up the matter I came upon an appeal to the public by a Skye Emigration Committee in 1852, in which this passage occurs :",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",311
"312","—In considering the appeal now made on behalf of the people of Skye, it will be borne in mind that periods of suffering are often periods of turbulence and disregard of the rights of property; that there was much in the social arrangements of Skye, and not a little even in the system on which the relief fund was administered, to excite bitterness, irritation, and discontent; yet during five years of suffering, no single case of violence, tumult, or outrage of any kind has occurred; and though the principal movable property in the island—its sheep flocks—is peculiarly exposed to depredation, and detection extremely difficult, yet sheep-stealing, or theft of any kind, has been comparatively  unknown. It may indeed, be said, that in no district of Britain of equal population, and however prosperous, has crime been more rare than it has been in Skye, during years of misery, danger, and want.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",312
"313","10082. Sheriff Nicolson.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",313
"314","—Was Sheriff Fraser the chairman of that committee?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",314
"315","—Yes. That is the character of the people to the present day.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",315
"316","10083. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",316
"317","—Are these decrees of removing often made use of by the landlords to recover their rent in preference to taking out small debt summonses?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",317
"318","—I don't know, because you have no power to recover under them, but it is a means of frightening them.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",318
"319","10084. And they pay?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",319
"320","—I suppose they do.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",320
"321","10085. Have you any means of making up a complete return which will show the cases in which the decrees were acted upon?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",321
"322","—I have no means of showing to what extent they were acted upon. The records of the court do not show it. Of course ; all these decrees could not have been acted upon, for if they had, there would have been no population in Skye today.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",322
"323","10086. The Chairman,",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",323
"324","—You have stated your desire that larger crofts should be formed out of lands now occupied by proprietors or by tacksmen ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",324
"325","—I cannot see how they could be formed without so encroaching.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",325
"326","10087. Do you contemplate compelling the proprietor to surrender the land when it is in his own hands, for the formation of such crofts ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",326
"327","—If he has an undue proportion of it in his own hands.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",327
"328","10088. How would you settle the question whether he has an undue proportion or not ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",328
"329","—That is a question of detail into which I would not be prepared strictly to go; but there is the parish of Bracadale, which is almost absolutely a waste, that is a very undue proportion of the land devoted to the maintenance of a very few.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",329
"330","10089. I want to get at your idea of the principle upon which you would contemplate compelling the proprietor to surrender lands in his own hands to form crofts ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",330
"331","—I don't know that any proprietor in Skye has such an undue proportion of land in his own hands, unless in the island of Raasay.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",331
"332","10090. But still, if you have matured an opinion upon the subject, I should like to have an unqualified expression of it. Are there circumstances in which you think it desirable that the proprietor should be obliged to surrender ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",332
"333","—By all means.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",333
"334","10091. Suppose the other case, that the land is not in the possession of the proprietor, but in the possession of a tenant holding under lease, do you contemplate cases in which it would be desirable that the law should oblige the lease to be cancelled, and the land surrendered for the formation of the crofts?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",334
"335","—Well, the leases are not so long. There are generally breaks in them, and I don't know that the exigencies of the case are such as would demand such a compulsitor to be immediately acted upon.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",335
"336","10092. Then you contemplate rather that at the termination of existing covenants the claim of the crofters to an augmentation of land should then be admitted?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",336
"337","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",337
"338","10093. At the end of existing contracts?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",338
"339","—Yes. I would like, of course, that any change in that way should be made with as little  inconvenience as possible all round, and with no loss either to the holder of the lease or",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",339
"340","to the proprietor.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",340
"341","10094. Well, but the rights of property are not dear to people only on account of their pecuniary value. They are dear for many other considerations,—considerations of pleasure, ornament, indulgence, pride, and so on. I wish to understand whether you think the principle of compulsion ought in extreme cases to be applied or not ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",341
"342","—Certainly.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",342
"343","10095. You have also stated that you desire that the crofters, or persons in a humble condition, should have the means of becoming actual proprietors of their own holdings ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",343
"344","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",344
"345","10096. Then you would give the crofter or small tenant the power of claiming to purchase his holding, irrespective of the consent of the proprietor?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",345
"346","—Well, I have a great admiration for the provisions of the Irish Land Bill, and I consider that any measure for the amelioration of the condition of the Highland crofters would be incomplete or superficial without provision for the purchase by the crofters—crofters who are able and willing—of their own holdings.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",346
"347","10097. But does the Irish Land Bill contain any provision enabling the small tenant to purchase the property of his holding without the consent of his landlord ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",347
"348","—-I believe it does not.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",348
"349","10098. Then do you desire the principle of compulsion, or would you admit that the right of purchase should only be exercised with the consent of the landlord?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",349
"350","—Well, I would not be prepared to give a definite answer right off; it involves very grave considerations.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",350
"351","10099. Speaking of the crofts in general that you desire to see formed, I understand that having selected the proper type of croft sufficient to support a single family, you think that croft ought to remain an undivisible quantity?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",351
"352","—I do think so. '",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",352
"353","10100. Looking at the smaller class of crofts that exist now, do you desire that the holders of those crofts should have fixity of tenure?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",353
"354","—Yes. ",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",354
"355","10101. In the event of small crofts —smaller in value and dimensions than your typical crofts",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",355
"356","—becoming naturally vacant, do you think that these small crofts ought to be relet or regranted in their present dimensions, or ought they to be added to other crofts?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",356
"357","—Added to other crofts.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",357
"358","10102. Where would you fix the limit? Would you say that a croft below £5 in value should be added to another, or where would you fix the limit?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",358
"359","—I would try to bring up the average crofts of the country to a size which would support a family in comfort.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",359
"360","10103. But in endeavouring to attain that ideal, which may be a very good one, how would you provide for that class of persons who desire to gain their living by fishing or other form of industry, but who don't want to be left without land altogether?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",360
"361","—The Highlander is a born land animal. He is not a fisherman. He is quite a different being altogether from the east coast fisherman. The east coaster is a fisherman ; the Highlander is a born soldier.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",361
"362","10104. But how could they be provided with those typical crofts sufficient to maintain a family ? Some must be fishermen; how would you provide them with cowsgrass and small holdings?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",362
"363","—I don't see how it could be done without encroaching upon large farms.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",363
"364","10105. You would provide for them by grants of land on the large farms and on the lands in the hands of the proprietors?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",364
"365","—So far as in the hands of proprietors to an undue extent.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",365
"366","10106. To what rule would you subject that class of small tenants? Would you give them also fixity of tenure?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",366
"367","—Yes, I cannot see it would be wise to make exceptions.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",367
"368","10107. Then you would give everybody who has a house and a small portion of land attached to it fixity of tenure so long as he pays his rent?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",368
"369","—Yes.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",369
"370","10108. What would you do with people who live in houses in the village of Portree?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",370
"371","—That is a different thing. These have no land, and we in Portree would give our eyes for it.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",371
"372","10109. They were asking for it to-day?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",372
"373","—Yes, and I hope they may get it. Before I retire I may be allowed to make an explanation which I consider necessary in regard to the case of Donald Nicolson, Totescore. I don't know but perhaps there has an impression gone abroad that there was some discrepancy between Mr Macdonald's statement of the case and what I stated in explanation at Uig, when appealed to by Donald Nicolson. There may be some outsiders who don't understand it.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",373
"374","10110. I don't quite understand it myself. I shall be very happy to hear your explanation?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",374
"375","—The explanation I wish recorded is that the £35, 11s. 8d. was paid by me—passed out of my hands",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",375
"376","—and no portion of that remained in my hands. The proprietor kept in his own hands £15, 17s. 6d. as the value of the man's house.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",376
"377","10111. The original sum mentioned before was not £35, but £55?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",377
"378","—With that, so far as I was concerned, I had nothing to do. I had only to do with the account of expenses which was rendered to me by Mr Macdonald, acting for Captain Fraser. My sole object is to make it clear that I passed the whole of the money that came into my hands on account of Donald Nicolson to the proprietor or his agent. I have here a note of expenses,  due by Donald Nicolson to Captain Fraser of Kilmuir, as follows :",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",378
"379","—Rent and violent profits, £16; expenses decerned for, £4, 18s. 8d.; do., further, £3, 4s.; extract decree and charges, 10s. 6d.; ground officer ejecting, and party, £ 2, 18s.; expenses for breach of interdict, £ £8, 0s. 6d.; total, £35, 11s. 8d. ; to value of houses, £15, 17s. 6d. ; leaving a balance of £ 19, 14s 2d, which was paid by me to the factor on 5th December 1877, and  for which his stamped receipt is produced.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",379
"380","[Mr Macdonald]",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",380
"381","—It is quite correct.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",381
"382","10112. The question that interested us most was to know what the proprietor actually got ; whether the proprietor got any more than the amount of the simple rent due to him at the term ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",382
"383","—Not one single farthing but the rent. The incoming tenant got the difference. Anything we got for",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",383
"384","violent profit went to the incoming tenant, to pay the damage which he alleged he suffered from not getting possession at Whitsunday.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",384
"385","10113. Then did the incoming tenant pay the proprietor any rent for the period during which he was not in the farm?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",385
"386","—No; we just got the rent, and nothing but the rent. I will show my books to the Commissioners,",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",386
"387","showing that we did not get a farthing but the rent, and that the incoming tenant got the rest.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",387
"388","10114. Have you any other statement in connection with this eviction? So far as I remember, it was stated by Nicolson that his rent had been doubled, and that he was willing to submit to his rent being doubled, but then that they charged him £ 1 more, which really was the straw which broke the camel's back, and that he would not stand it?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",388
"389","—That was his statement, but we deny that. The £ 1 had nothing to do with his eviction; it was his misconduct.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",389
"390","10115. Was his rent doubled ?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",390
"391","—Yes, it was; but that had nothing to do with the eviction. He was quite agreeable to the rent.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",391
"392","10116. Why was his rent doubled?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",392
"393","—Like all the rest. It was according to the valuation of Mr Malcolm, like all the rest of the tenants on the estate. That had nothing to do with his eviction.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",393
"394","10117. There was a case cited by Mr Maclachlan of a model eviction, in which all the tenants in the township petitioned the landlord to get rid of an inconvenient member. Was the case of this poor man as bad as that ? Do you think that his fellow-crofters would have petitioned for his removal?",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",394
"395","—I think it was a worse case, or fully as bad. The tenant who suffered from Nicolson's carelessness about his stock is here, I believe; and another tenant, whose sheep got killed by Nicolson's dog, is here. I have no personal ill-will to Nicolson, not the slightest.[Mr Maclachlan]. I have no doubt it would involve going into a long proof to prove his misconduct, but there is no doubt that the circumstances at the time produced an impression on my mind which I have not forgotten yet, as being an exercise of the utmost high-handedness on the part of the landlord.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",395
"396","[Mr Macdonald]",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",396
"397","—That is your impression.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",397
"398","[Mr Maclachlan]",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",398
"399","—I only speak of my own impression.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",399
"400","10118. We will stop this discussion, because it is impossible to go into the question. There is no doubt that in this matter Mr Maclachlan acted a most honourable and humane part, according to his view of the case.",173,"Dugald Maclachlan","Skye, Portree",400
