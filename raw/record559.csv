"1","DONALD M'DOUGALL, Crofter, Balphuil (52)—examined.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",1
"2","33421. The Chairman.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",2
"3","—Have you been elected a delegate?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",3
"4","—Yes.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",4
"5","33422. Were there a good number of people present?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",5
"6","—Yes, a great many.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",6
"7","33423. Have you a written statement to produce ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",7
"8","—Yes, but we wish to say something before that. We wish to know whether it it true that an assurance is being given to crofters and cottars in giving their evidence before this Commission from proprietors and factors.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",8
"9","33424. Such an assurance has been given in many places by proprietors and factors, and I will now ask whether there is any one present who will give an assurance in regard to the island of Tyree ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",9
"10","—[Mr M'Diarmid]. I am local factor to his Grace the Duke of Argyle.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",10
"11","33425. Do you feel enabled to give an assurance to the people here present that no one will suffer prejudice in consequence of what he says here on this occasion?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",11
"12","—No, I cannot give any such assurance. I did not ask for it, and I was not told to give it.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",12
"13","33426. You don't think you are, knowing the disposition and character of the proprietor of the island, enabled to give such an assurance on your own responsibility ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",13
"14","—I would say the Duke of Argyle won't do anything against any man who will tell the truth.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",14
"15","33427. Are you able or not, from your knowledge of the character of the proprietor, to give a positive assurance that no prejudice will occur to anyone on account of what is said here to-day?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",15
"16","—I am not going to say that.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",16
"17","33128. (To Witness).",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",17
"18","—It is not in the power of the Commission to give you any assurance of the kind. The Commission cannot interfere between you and your proprietor, or between you and the law. Whatever you state, therefore, now will be at your own risk and on your own responsibility. But from what we know of the character of the Duke of Argyle, we cannot believe—we do not believe —that any prejudice could occur to you on account of what you say.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",18
"19","—[Witness]. We live in that part of Scotland where most of that suffering is taking place, and oppression and slavery. We are poor people. We cannot give any of the statements that we came here prepared to make unless we receive the assurance that no crofter will be evicted from his croft, or cottar put out of his house, for telling what we have to tell; and that is the truth, and nothing but the truth.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",19
"20","—[Mr M'Diarmid]. I have had this moment put into my hands a letter from the Duke's chamberlain. He says the crofters are at liberty to make any statement they have to make without any fear of after consequences.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",20
"21","— [Witness]. What I have to say is, that we never had much fear of the good man the proprietor, because factors here were his eyes, his ears, and his mouth in his dealings with us. And, concerning the house of Argyle, we desire that whatever we say, anything that we complain of as having been unjustly done, will be put to the credit of the factors, and not to the house of Argyle. My reason for saying so is that we get letters from Kintyre —I don't know if cottars get such information, but we crofters do —if we have any complaint to make in respect of rent, or any injustice done to us, we must go and state our case in such and such a place in Kintyre. These letters are written in English, in the name of the Duke.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",21
"22","33129. Is the complaint this, that when you have anything to state you are obliged to state it in writing in English to a factor living at a different place ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",22
"23","—No; we do not complain of that at all. We think that this is an indication on the part of the proprietor that he is willing to hear and redress our grievances. That is our understanding of it.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",23
"24","33130. Have you got a written statement on the part of your township which you wish to communicate to the Commission ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",24
"25","— Unto the Right Honourable the Royal Commission, the Petition of the Crofters of the Township of Balephuil, humbly sheweth, That our grievances are ",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",25
"26","—1st, We have been deprived about thirty years ago, by John Campbell, Esq., the then factor of the island, of a part of Ben Hynish, which from the time of our forefathers belonged to the common pasture of the township of Balephuil, thereby reducing the stock on each croft by one horse, one cow, and one stirk less. ",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",26
"27","2nd, We do now pay, and had been paying, since we have been deprived of that said part of our common pasture rent as high as when we have been in possession of that part ",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",27
"28","3rd, We do not possess any shore where to obtain sea-weed wherewith to manure our ground, since we have been deprived of that said part of our common pasture, if we be not allowed by the good-will of the occupier of that part of our common pasture we have been deprived of to have the sea-weed. ",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",28
"29","4th, We pay road rates, though we were ourselves keeping up till this year about three miles of road. We are under these disadvantages, while we humbly think we ought not to be under any of them. for the following reasons:—",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",29
"30","(1) We had our rent paid at and up till the time we have been deprived of the said part of our common  pasture;  and, moreover, we have been deprived of it without summonses being served upon us. ",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",30
"31","(2) If we have been deprived of that said part of our common pasture, we were entitled to have our rents reduced in proportion, as our ground could not then raise better or more bountiful crops than when we were in possession of said part of our common pasture.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",31
"32","(3) From the time of our forefathers the township of Balephuil possessed a shore from which to obtain seaweed to manure the ground, till we lost possession of it by having been deprived of that said part of our common pasture, as the shore belongs to that piece of land. ",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",32
"33","(4) As we are assessed for road money, we consider it very unjust that we should have ourselves to keep up any road, as we have done for thirty years. Therefore our demands are—",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",33
"34","1st, To get back that part of our common pasture of which we have been deprived, or rent reduced in proportion to extent of land taken from us, and £1176 for loss occasioned us by having been deprived of said part of our common pasture for thirty years. ",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",34
"35","2nd, That we shall be entitled to have a right to foresaid shore, with road thereto for sea-weed to manure our ground. ",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",35
"36","3rd, That as we are assessed for road money, and we were ourselves keeping up about three miles of road till this year, we shall get £360 for the work we have done on the road in that length of time —thirty years. These our said grievances and demands we submit to your Lordships, and pray : May it therefore please your Lordships to make an inquiry thereinto, and redress our grievances accordingly.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",36
"37","—DONALD M'DOUGALL, delegate.'",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",37
"38","33431. You say that thirty years ago you were deprived of a portion of your common pasture, and had no reduction of rent; did you receive any other advantage or benefit from the proprietor in connection with the deprivation of your land ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",38
"39","—Nothing.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",39
"40","33432. You complain that, in consequence of the common pasture being taken away, you have no proper access to the shore ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",40
"41","—That is so.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",41
"42","33433. But although you do not possess the shore, do you go to the shore practically to get sea-weed ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",42
"43","—Yes, we do ; but that is through the good will of the person who got the ground.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",43
"44","33434. Has the tenant of the ground ever prevented you, or put any difficulty in your way, in all those thirty years ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",44
"45","—There was a gate erected to prevent our passage, for fear of spoiling the grass. That gate was closed, and we were not allowed to pass. He did not keep the sea-ware from us, but he did not wish us to go trespassing through his ground, spoiling the grass.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",45
"46","33435. As matter of fact, do you habitually go for the ware?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",46
"47","—We have no other way but that of getting to the shore and getting sea-weed.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",47
"48","33436. And do you habitually go without any impediment at this moment?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",48
"49","—Yes, we do.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",49
"50","33437. Do you make any payment to the tenant on account of the sea-ware ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",50
"51","—We do not, because it belongs to ourselves, if we get it out.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",51
"52","33438. Is there a sufficient quantity on the shore for the use of your lands ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",52
"53","—Plenty.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",53
"54","33439. You complain that you pay road money, and yet that you are obliged to keep up a particular road of three miles; who made this road of three miles long ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",54
"55","—I don't know who made it, but we measured it.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",55
"56","33440. Is it a made road, or is it merely a natural road across the ground ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",56
"57","—It is a made highway from quay to quay.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",57
"58","33441. Do the crofters expend any money upon it, or do you merely apply some labour ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",58
"59","—We pay our rates for the general public highways, and we keep up this road besides with our own labour, although it is entirely outside the boundaries of our farm.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",59
"60","33442. But it leads to the shore. How much labour does it come to for each occupier in the year ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",60
"61","—I believe it comes up to about twenty days a year for each crofter, with a horse and cart —nearly that, anyhow.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",61
"62","33443. Do you mean that each crofter has a cart and horse engaged in the labour ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",62
"63","—Yes.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",63
"64","33444. For twenty days ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",64
"65","—Yes. It may be ten days one year, and twenty or more than twenty another year.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",65
"66","33445. You say that thirty years ago a portion of your pasture was taken away; has any of your pasture or arable ground been taken away since that ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",66
"67","—No.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",67
"68","33446. During the last thirty years has the rent of your crofts been increased?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",68
"69","—Yes, it was twice raised.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",69
"70","33447. What stock do the crofters keep now on a full croft ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",70
"71","—I keep two cows and two horses.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",71
"72","33448. Young cattle ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",72
"73","—I have no young cattle at present.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",73
"74","33449. Any sheep?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",74
"75","—No ; no crofter in the island has sheep.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",75
"76","33450. What rent do you pay ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",76
"77","—£15, 2s.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",77
"78","33451. How many acres of arable land have you ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",78
"79","—Sixteen acres.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",79
"80","33452. What is the area of the hill pasture for the whole township ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",80
"81","—I cannot tell that.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",81
"82","33453. Is it very large ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",82
"83","—It is not large now, since we were deprived of a part of it.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",83
"84","33454. Is the road to the shore, on which you expend so much work, only useful for your township, or is it of use to and used by other people ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",84
"85","—Yes, it is useful to the country side.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",85
"86","33455. Who uses it ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",86
"87","—It leads to the quay.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",87
"88","33456. Does anybody else work upon it, or only the people of your township ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",88
"89","—No one else does, or has ever done, any work upon that road but us.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",89
"90","33457. What goes on at this quay? Is it for fishermen or the exportation of cattle ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",90
"91","— It is for fishermen.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",91
"92","33458. Is that for the fishermen of your own township, or of other townships?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",92
"93","—It was originally built for our township, but it is often used by people from all parts of the country, who run in there in bad weather. In connection with this quay, I have to mention that nine crofters and some cottars who had their lands near this quay were moving to another part of our hill pasture. The pretext that was used for taking the hill pasture from us was those nine cottars that were moving from the quay. The place was cleared, and now when we go upon a rough day there is no person to hold a rope.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",93
"94","33459. Have any cottars within the last thirty years been brought in and put upon you in your present township ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",94
"95","—Yes, some even since that time; there was all that number, and there have been some since.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",95
"96","33460. Were these cottars the natural increase of your own population, or were they brought in from the outside ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",96
"97","—They belonged to our own township. There were some that came from the outside as well. Some of",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",97
"98","those came from some ground cleared by the factor to make a farm for himself.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",98
"99","33461. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",99
"100","—Who got the land when it was taken away—the whole of the hill pasture thirty years ago ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",100
"101","—It was the tacks man of Hynish who got it from us, and now Mr M'Quarie has got it.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",101
"102","33462. Who is Mr M'Quarie?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",102
"103","—One of the tacksmen of the place.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",103
"104","33463. Is he a large tacksman ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",104
"105","—Yes; he has two large tacks.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",105
"106","33464. What do you want to say in addition ?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",106
"107","— That this factor that cleared our place thirty years ago got the management of the property, but ordained a statute, like that of the Medes and Persians, that no one should have either a sheep or a pig, for fear that these sheep of ours would break in upon the large farms. He went round also among us, holding a paper in the one hand and a notice to quit in the other, and he told us that unless we signed this paper, the effect of which was that we would require to be obedient to anything and everything which either he or the Duke of Argyle would order us to do, we would have to quit the place. We signed the paper, otherwise we would have to quit. After we signed the paper, his mode of procedure was to raise our rents excessively, our idea being that he did not mean to raise our rents because he thought the place was worth the rents, but because he thought he would get us to follow our neighbours to foreign places and give up the crofts. That day we would have signed ourselves out into the sea, but that alternative was not put before us; and what we wish now to bring under your notice is, that while we live in a land of law and liberty—it gladdens our heart that our country is a country of law and liberty—still neither the law nor the liberty reached this estate. We were in a state of slavery and oppression. We have heard, but we are not quite certain whether it is the case, that it is the Duke's desire that those places which were cleared by the removal of our neighbours to foreign places and some to the sea should be distributed among us. If that had been the case, it would have been good for us—if such a policy had been pursued —but it was not. Instead of that policy being pursued, those vacant farms were consolidated into large farms. There are ten of them now upon the island, and upon eight of these there were crofters in old times—before Mr Campbell's day.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",107
"108","33465. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",108
"109","—What is the size of the large farms you refer to?",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",109
"110","—I believe the smallest of them is about £100; the highest is about £400.",559,"Donald Mcdougall","Argyll, Tyree",110
