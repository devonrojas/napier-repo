"1","JOHN BAIRD, Proprietor of Knoydart (31)—examined. ",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",1
"2","9210. The Chairman.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",2
"3","—Do you wish to make a statement to the Commission?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",3
"4","—I have really no statement to make. I should much prefer being questioned on one or two subjects. I have heard the subject of deer forests brought forward, and I thought it desirable that I should be examined on that point.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",4
"5","9211. Mr Cameron.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",5
"6","—When did you succeed to your property?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",6
"7","—In 1876.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",7
"8","9212. In what state did you find your property when you succeeded? Were the farms all let, and to whom?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",8
"9","—There are practically only five farms on the place—very large farms. Two of these were unlet, and I",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",9
"10","was obliged to take over the stock myself. I have since had other two farms falling into my own hands.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",10
"11","9213. But when you succeeded three of them were let to tenants?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",11
"12","—Yes.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",12
"13","9214. To large tenants'?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",13
"14","—To large tenants who were non-resident.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",14
"15","9215. And the other two?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",15
"16","—They were unlet.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",16
"17","9216. Were they in the hands of your uncle when he died?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",17
"18","—Yes.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",18
"19","9217. And the sheep stock belonged to him?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",19
"20","—Yes.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",20
"21","9218. Did he leave you the sheep stock?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",21
"22","—I had to buy it.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",22
"23","9219. Have you had these farms in your possession ever since?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",23
"24","—Yes.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",24
"25","9220. How have these farms answered with you financially?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",25
"26","—I had a return last year for the first time upon the capital invested. Up till last year, I shall be sufficiently accurate if I say the rent was paid, and there was no return for the capital invested in the stock during the period from 1876 to 1881.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",26
"27","9221. Then what was the next thing that happened with the other three tenants? Did any of them leave, or were their leases out, or what happened?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",27
"28","—One of the farms fell into my hands the year before last, and another last year.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",28
"29","9222. And you still have one tenant left?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",29
"30","—One tenant left.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",30
"31","9223. When is his lease out?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",31
"32","—In about six or seven years.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",32
"33","9224. Do you anticipate that that farm will also fall into your own hands?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",33
"34","—As my experience hitherto has been, I should say so.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",34
"35","9225. In point of fact, you are in possession of four out of the five large farms, and you anticipate that when the fifth falls out of lease you will have to take that over to?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",35
"36","—I believe so.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",36
"37","9226. And on the two farms which you have held for some years you have practically lost money?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",37
"38","—In the sense that I had no return for the capital invested.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",38
"39","9227. If you had borrowed the money you would have had to pay interest, and therefore you would have lost it?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",39
"40","—Yes.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",40
"41","9228. Of course, I need not ask you whether it is against your own will that these things have happened, because if you lost money you don't want to be burdened with more farms?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",41
"42","—Very much against my will.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",42
"43","9229. Can you give us any idea as to the causes which render the taking of these sheep farms so difficult to arrange, and also to what you attribute your own losses on the farms you occupy?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",43
"44","—In the first place, the chief cause why these farms are not let is because I declined to let them on the same terms on which they were let before. I declined to let them to non-resident south country farmers. I wish to divide them so far as I can into sizes which would form respectable farms for respectable resident tenants, and hitherto I have not had offers for that class of farm that were",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",44
"45","at all acceptable.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",45
"46","9230. Before you go on to that point I wish to finish the other point. You say one reason was that you did not wish to let them to non-resident tenants was you believe you could have let them to non-resident tenants at the present time?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",46
"47","—Not without very great loss. In fact, I have not had an offer.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",47
"48","9231. Did you advertise them1?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",48
"49","—I did not advertise them as large farms. I advertised the land to be divided up as might be thought most advisable to form workable farms.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",49
"50","9232. But you still think a non-resident tenant, if he could be found, would not be able to work those farms satisfactorily to himself without a large reduction of rent?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",50
"51","—In 1870 a farm which was previously let at £826 was offered to the outgoing tenant for £700, and that was refused.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",51
"52","9233. Now, will you please go on with your statement as to what steps you took recently, when the other two farms fell into your own hands, to get them let?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",52
"53","—I advertised. I hand in the form of advertisement that was put into the papers last year. It practically means that I was prepared to let the land to be divided up into farms that could be worked by resident",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",53
"54","tenants.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",54
"55","9234. How many large farms were advertised?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",55
"56","—Three are advertised now.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",56
"57","9235. Into how many did you propose to divide them?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",57
"58","—I was prepared to divide them to suit any reasonable offer on the part of any tenant who seemed desirable.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",58
"59","9236. Then you say you did not care though you got five, six, or seven separate tenants for the three holdings?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",59
"60","—I hoped to get more than that.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",60
"61","9237. Were you prepared to build houses and do what was necessary in order to enable the tenants to make a start?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",61
"62","—I was prepared to do all that, and to make a considerable sacrifice in order to have a resident tenantry.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",62
"63","9238. What was the result of these endeavours of yours?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",63
"64","—The result was that I had two offers. I had offers for two pieces of land. One was in May 1881. It was entirely new ground, and very good ground. The offer for that was about 2s. 2d. per sheep. That we considered too small, the stock being all ewes. Then I had an offer for what I considered the best part of the land on my estate —practically a slice of the best land on the coast, cutting off the hill land, which had formerly been under sheep—and the offer for that amounted to Is. 5d. per sheep ; and that was only on condition of my expending about £1000 in putting the farm-house into repair and other matters of that kind, which would have brought the actual rent per sheep below Is. That offer I felt justified in refusing. These were the only two offers I had, and the first offer was made before the advertisement appeared.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",64
"65","9239. Suppose you had fair offers for those two portions of the farm to which you allude, would you be able to let them without sacrificing the rest of the land, or would that have been a disadvantage?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",65
"66","—The first I mentioned was in such a form as I wished to let. I should have been glad to accept a good offer for that,",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",66
"67","9240. If the offer for the first mentioned piece had been satisfactory you would have accepted it?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",67
"68","—Yes, but for the other it was absurd. It was merely taking a bit, and leaving the rest further inland useless.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",68
"69","9241. Did the former tenants, when their leases came to an end, make any offer of renewal or express any willingness to go on with their farms, or did they simply refuse to have anything to do with them?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",69
"70","—I never heard from them at all.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",70
"71","9242. Did you take any steps to renew the leases?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",71
"72","—I did not, because I had a fixed determination not to continue the system of large non-resident farmers.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",72
"73","6243. You did not give them the opportunity ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",73
"74","—I did not. ",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",74
"75","9244. You mentioned one cause of the difficulty of letting sheep farms. Can you state any other cause?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",75
"76","—In my experience wool, is the great difficulty. I fancy if wool bad been at a reasonable price during the years I have spoken of, there would have been no special difficulty in letting the farms; but the price of wool, combined with the low price of sheep, made wedder land particularly unprofitable. During the six years from 1876 to 1881, part of Scotas, which forms half the land I purposed clearing, produced not only no return for the money invested, but no rent —less than no rent, it is put in my paper. I was rather doubtful about that matter, so I wrote to my agent to see if it produced no rent, as I thought it must mean no interest on the capital invested, and he writes to me this morning:",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",76
"77","—Regarding the wedder land of Scotas, from 1876 to 1881, that land as stated produced no rent at all for six years, and no interest for the money invested in the stock upon it during those years.'",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",77
"78","9245. Do you attribute the present difficulty of letting sheep farms at all to the high price of stock and to the doubt which a farmer has when he goes into a farm whether he will ever get his money back again?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",78
"79","—I should say that is distinctly a difficulty now.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",79
"80","9246. What do you do about the wintering of your sheep?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",80
"81","—I have to send them away.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",81
"82","9247. What does that cost you?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",82
"83","—Something like half a sovereign a head for the young sheep we send away.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",83
"84","9248. Have you any idea, from what you have heard from people formerly connected with sheep farming, what the cost of wintering sheep used to be in old days?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",84
"85","—So far as I know, there was less sending away of sheep in old days, and that was got at by there being few sheep on the place. In those days they kept only the number of sheep the land could winter and now, so far as I can make out, the number kept is the number the land can summer.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",85
"86","9249. But I presume they always sent away a certain proportion?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",86
"87","—I believe they sent away a certain proportion.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",87
"88","9250. But you cannot say what was the former cost of wintering hoggs?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",88
"89","—No.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",89
"90","9251. You have described to us the difficulties which beset the sheep farmer, and the difficulties particularly which beset you in your endeavour to let those lands ; will you tell us what you have done in consequence?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",90
"91","—I found that the chief stretch of my wedder land was a dead loss to me from year to year. For some six years I was losing money steadily upon it. It occurred to me to give it up as wedder land, and I am putting it under forest.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",91
"92","9252. The Chairman.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",92
"93","—That means deer forest?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",93
"94","—Deer forest.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",94
"95","9253. Mr Cameron.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",95
"96","—Suppose you wish to let it as a deer forest, what rent do you expect to get for it?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",96
"97","—According to the figures I have got here, putting the wedders at 2s. a year, which is a great deal more than the rent I can get, and more rent than it ever fetched in fact,—and putting the full stock, such as was given over by the outgoing tenant, as the highest that could be put upon it —the amount was £1716, 18s. on the part of the land that I propose foresting.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",97
"98","9254. You don't propose foresting it all?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",98
"99","—Only a certain part of the wedder land; the high land.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",99
"100","9255. What do you expect from the forest?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",100
"101","—I reckon it will be worth more than double that, at all events.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",101
"102","9256. Is there any crofting population on your estate?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",102
"103","—None at all on this part or the part that is going to be forested. I have one township with eleven crofters on the side facing the Sound of Sleat.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",103
"104","9257. They are not near the ground you propose to forest ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",104
"105","—They are not within nine miles of any point of it.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",105
"106","9258. Do you see any signs on your estate of the remains of crofting populations ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",106
"107","—Yes, considerable remains.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",107
"108","9259. Do these places where you see the remains appear to be suitable for cultivation ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",108
"109","—I think it would be possible to support a certain number of people in the neighbourhood of the remains, but I think that would be done at the expense of losing the pasturage of the inner and upper hill country which is at present under sheep, apart altogether from the piece of land I purpose  foresting.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",109
"110","9260. Would you approve of the introduction of crofters into these places as they used to be before?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",110
"111","—I think it would be an injury to the property.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",111
"112","9261. Are your eleven crofters at all crowded together so that you could move some of them from that place which you described to where they were before ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",112
"113","—I have not had any complaint of crowding. I have not had any complaints from my crofters at all.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",113
"114","9262. What size are the crofts ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",114
"115","—Something like 500 acres among the eleven.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",115
"116","9263. Including hill pasture ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",116
"117","—Yes.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",117
"118","9264. How many cows do they each keep ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",118
"119","—I have not got the numbers down separately, but they have fifty cattle of all ages. That figure refers",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",119
"120","to the cattle actually on the place, not to the summing. There are fifty cattle, one hundred and ninety-nine sheep, and five horses, among the eleven tenants.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",120
"121","9265. Then they are pretty comfortable?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",121
"122","—So far as I understand, they are pretty comfortable. I have never heard any complaint from them.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",122
"123","9266. Would they get any more employment if you had a shooting tenant for the deer forest, or if you yourself occupied the deer forest ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",123
"124","—I think the younger men might be employed as ghillies if they chose to give up their fishing.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",124
"125","9267. Do they fish much?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",125
"126","—Some of them fish.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",126
"127","9268. Do they prosecute it with any vigour ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",127
"128","—Not so much as I should like. I had a good deal of annoyance with them some years ago. I was very much annoyed at their not fishing, and I called the heads of the families together one day, and rather abused them for allowing the east coast fishers to come and take the fish away under their noses. They lie between Loch Hourn and Loch Nevis, and Loch Hourn has been a large fishing station of late. I asked why they stood by with their hands folded, when they saw the east coast men taking the food from under their noses. They explained that their only difficulty was the want of nets. I asked how much it would cost to supply them with nets. I was told about £15 for each boat, and the men there represented half a dozen boats. They were overjoyed when I told them I would furnish them with the money if they would repay me in a reasonable time. They said they would repay me in three months. I said that three years would do quite well. They went away quite overjoyed. When I came back next year I found that one man had purchased £5 worth of nets from a neighbour, but otherwise the offer had not been taken advantage of at all. I had told them they were to get nets, and my factor was entrusted to pay for them as soon as they were bought, and all they had to do was to send the bill to me.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",128
"129","9269. Have you talked to them since ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",129
"130","—I have talked to one or two since. They seemed to me to be rather disheartened.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",130
"131","9270. They are not very keen fishermen 1",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",131
"132","—I think they did fish better in the winter. The last year or two, when there was a great amount of fishing in Loch Hourn, they got a certain amount of employment about the fishers without having nets themselves. I don't think they can be called keen fishermen.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",132
"133","9271. Did they make much last year at the herring fishing?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",133
"134","—Very little, I think.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",134
"135","9272. Was that owing to their own fault?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",135
"136","—I can understand no other cause for it.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",136
"137","9273. It was a very good fishing last year?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",137
"138","—I have been so informed. I was making some inquiry last winter, and I was told there was something like £180,000 worth of herring taken out of Loch Hourn.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",138
"139","9274. Into whose pockets did that money go?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",139
"140","—There were about 1000 boats there. I think most of them were east country boats, and some of",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",140
"141","them were from Stornoway.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",141
"142","9275. You don't know the proportion between the east coast and west coast boats?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",142
"143","—No, but there was a very large number of east coast boats, and they are large boats.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",143
"144","9276. The Chairman.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",144
"145","—You spoke of certain large sheep farms which came into your possession, some untenanted and some tenanted. What was the ancient condition of those farms, both tenanted and untenanted? Were they in remote times held as small crofts or small farms?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",145
"146","—As regards one or two of them, I think I can say they were not held as small holdings. There were always a number of small cottages upon them with crofters ; but Scotas was regarded as an estate distinct from the rest of it at one time, and I believe that was held practically by one man. For Berrisdale the same may be said.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",146
"147","9277. About what time was the large sheep farming system introduced? When were the first leases given to non-resident low country farmers?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",147
"148","—I imagine it is not more than twenty-five or thirty years ago, but I can only speak by guess.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",148
"149","9278. Then were the rents recently paid the first rents paid, or had there been a renewal of lease with a rise?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",149
"150","—There had been a renewal, with a rise in some cases. The rent was certainly very much larger than",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",150
"151","it was at first.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",151
"152","9279. Can you give me any idea what was the amount of rent paid by the sheep farmer under the first lease, and what was the amount paid under the second lease, in any one particular farm?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",152
"153","—I have not got it in any one case, but I have the estate rental, which will come to the same thing.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",153
"154","9280. It is chiefly under sheep farms?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",154
"155","—Entirely.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",155
"156","9281. What was the estate rental under the first leases and then under the second leases?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",156
"157","—In the year 1858-59 it was £2766, 9s. 6d.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",157
"158","9282. And under the second leases?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",158
"159","—£4193, 17s. 10d.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",159
"160","9283. When the second leases expired, or were about to expire, you say you did not wish to relet on the old system, but if you had wished it you could not have got tenants to take the farms on the terms of the second leases, which produced £4193?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",160
"161","—I very much doubt whether I could have got much more than the original rent for them.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",161
"162","9284. Suppose the property had been offered at the original rent of £2766, could that or something a little more have been got? ",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",162
"163","—I can hardly say; certainly I think not more.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",163
"164","9285. So that practically, if there had been a determination to relet, the rental of 1858 could have been got?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",164
"165","—I am not sure of that, but I had no wish to relet in the same way.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",165
"166","9286. I know you stated that, but I want to arrive at a sort of impression as to whether, if you had resolved to relet to the same class of tenants they would have given the same rent which was given twenty or twentyfive years ago?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",166
"167","—I believe it could be got now. I rather doubt whether it could have been got within the last year or two. ",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",167
"168","9287. Then I should say you are very much in the position of a great number of proprietors on the borders and in the south of Scotland, who are practically obliged to go back to the rental of about 1856. However, you embraced a resolution not to relet to the same class of tenants at all, and you had an honest and zealous desire to let the property in smaller parcels available for resident tenants?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",168
"169","—Quite so.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",169
"170","9288. Have you abandoned all hope of being able to do that?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",170
"171","—Not at all. I am perfectly ready to accept tenants at this moment, and very desirous to get rid of the anxiety.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",171
"172","9289. You intend to persevere in your previous intention?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",172
"173","—Yes.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",173
"174","9290. Except with reference to a particular farm or class of land?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",174
"175","—That is a portion composed of wedder land, which does not all belong to one farm. It is land which I have hitherto found unprofitable, taken mainly from one farm and partly from two others.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",175
"176","9291. But the withdrawal of that wedder land will not seriously impair the value of the sheep farms?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",176
"177","—It will very highly increase it. It will make the farms more letable.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",177
"178","9292. But it was not from a desire to convert the land into a deer forest, but really from inability to let it otherwise?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",178
"179","—If the land had been profitable to me, I should not have turned it into a deer forest.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",179
"180","9293. You are prepared to erect on the farms buildings and everything that is necessary to set up this smaller class of tenants?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",180
"181","—That is my intention. I shall be unable to do it all at once for everybody, but that is my intention.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",181
"182","9294. What is the average rental of those smaller farms you propose to establish?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",182
"183","—I have absolutely no fixed intention on the subject. I should like to have farms at from £100 to £200 or less. I should be prepared to have them at £50, if I found desirable tenants. The size of the farm would depend on the condition of the place. I should let it only in such a way that the hill grazing would be divided among the farmers who had the shore ground.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",183
"184","9295. Do you expect that the aggregate rental of these small farms would amount to as much as the £2766?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",184
"185","—No, considering the buildings. I expect I should have to throw in the buildings probably.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",185
"186","9296. Then you expect to get the original rental of £2766 plus the rental of the deer forest?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",186
"187","—Yes.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",187
"188","9297. Which would raise the whole rental to about £1192?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",188
"189","—Somewhere about that.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",189
"190","9298. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",190
"191","—In what year did your uncle buy the estate?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",191
"192","—I believe it was in the year 1859.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",192
"193","9299. What is the extent of it ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",193
"194","—About 67,000 acres.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",194
"195","9300. Have you got a plan of it?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",195
"196","—I have not.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",196
"197","9301. Have you any idea how much arable land is among those 67,000 acres,—I mean what had once been under the plough?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",197
"198","—I cannot say.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",198
"199","9302. Would there be 2000 or 3000?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",199
"200","—I should think not.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",200
"201","9303. How much then, roughly?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",201
"202","—I have never thought of the matter. It is in extremely small patches, and what has been arable land is now in such a condition that cultivation is hardly practicable. At a rough guess, I should say that there is not one-third of the extent you have put; I should say it is very much under 1000 acres.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",202
"203","9304. You mentioned that you have eleven families of crofters by the shores of the Loch. Do you know the number of souls in those families?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",203
"204","—I do not, but I think there are not above fifty.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",204
"205","9305. What other population is upon your estate?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",205
"206","—The total population is about 450.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",206
"207","9306. Are you aware there was a very large population resident at one time upon your estate?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",207
"208","—There was, I believe. ",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",208
"209","9307. Scotas was once an independent property?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",209
"210","—I have so understood.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",210
"211","9308. And you stated you did not think there were many small tenants upon that at one time?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",211
"212","—I stated it was held by one man. There are the remains of a number of small cottages; I do not know whether these were crofters or cottars'.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",212
"213","9309. That makes you suppose the proprietor of Scotas had no  tenants?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",213
"214","—I did not venture to suppose that, but I understood it had been a sheep farm longer than any other place in the neighbourhood. That is what I meant to convey.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",214
"215","9310. There is another property, Barrisdale. There was a well-known family of that name, Macdonald of Barrisdale?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",215
"216","—Yes.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",216
"217","9311. Don't you suppose they had a very considerable number of followers, —in 1745, for instance ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",217
"218","—Undoubtedly they had in those days.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",218
"219","9312. There is another farm of yours called Scammadale?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",219
"220","—I have a place called Scammadale; there is no farm on it.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",220
"221","9313. Would you be surprised to hear there was a distinct farm and property there?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",221
"222","—I am most anxious to have a family there again.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",222
"223","9314. I mean a family in the position of gentlemen?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",223
"224","—I was not aware of that.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",224
"225","9315. Glen Medle is part of your estate?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",225
"226","—Yes.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",226
"227","9316. Was there not an hereditary family there?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",227
"228","—I was not aware of that.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",228
"229","9317. With regard to evictions which took place before your time, are you not aware that within the memory of living men there was a very serious eviction,—in the time of the Glengarry trustees? ",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",229
"230","—I believe there were some very barbarous evictions at that time.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",230
"231","9318. And that there was some resistance on the part of the people?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",231
"232","—So I have read.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",232
"233","9319. You made a remark which probably you would like to reconsider. In answer to Lochiel, you said that the introduction of crofters (you did not mention in large numbers or small numbers) would be an injury to the property?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",233
"234","—What I meant was that I should like to carry out my idea of having moderate sized farms first. I think crofters might follow with advantage then. Work could be found for them. My conception is that",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",234
"235","a small crofter there would have no outlet for his labour beyond the work of his croft; and I think it is desirable that the crofters should find labour on a farm in the neighbourhood.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",235
"236","9320. Don't you think it would be better to begin the reverse way,—as a delegate told us in Skye, to begin with a smallish croft, but larger than the present, and work up till he gets a better?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",236
"237","—Quite so, and I should be glad to have some of those crofters to take my larger farms.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",237
"238","9321. But then you might commence upon your own estate by beginning them low?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",238
"239","—I am not sure of that. It does not seem that the crofters improve the land.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",239
"240","9322. That may or may not be; it depends upon the matter of encouragement. Now, with regard to the fishing, are you aware that the east coast people, with their larger boats and trawling, do really destroy the fishing.of the small people?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",240
"241","—I am aware a great deal of that goes on, but I am not aware it destroys the fishing. I am not sufficiently informed on the point to speak.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",241
"242","9323. But you are aware it is alleged?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",242
"243","—I am aware it is a grievance.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",243
"244","9324. With regard to your idea about settling those tenants whom you referred to, your property is not very accessible? Is there a good road going through Glengarry?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",244
"245","—To the edge of it practically there is, —to Loch Hourn.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",245
"246","9325. Have you made a pier upon the loch?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",246
"247","—Sir Arthur Bass is making a pier.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",247
"248","9326. Is it to be open to the public?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",248
"249","—Yes, he made it on that condition.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",249
"250","9327. Do you think the inaccessibility of your property had anything to do with the want of people coming forward?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",250
"251","—I have no doubt it had.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",251
"252","9328. Is the climate a good one ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",252
"253","—It is ; I spent the last winter there, and enjoyed it admirably. So far as I can make out, we had the best winter weather there was in Scotland.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",253
"254","9329. You seem to find fault with the small people for not fishing, and you also told us you are suffering a good deal from not getting any return from your lands. Why don't you, in order to recoup yourself, think of the fishing, and getting a share of the £180,000 taken out of Loch Hourn?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",254
"255","—I have been very unsuccessful in my speculations, and I would rather let the people who work at it carry it out themselves. I would be glad to assist them another year.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",255
"256","9330. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",256
"257","—Mr Fraser Mackintosh quoted a remark which you made in answer to Lochiel, to the effect that you thought it would be disadvantageous to the property to introduce crofters. Am I right in understanding you to mean that they would occupy the lower land, and you would not be able profitably to make use of the upper land?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",257
"258","—Quite so; that was my meaning.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",258
"259","9331. Professor Mackinnon.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",259
"260","—We had a gentleman here yesterday, himself a proprietor and a well-known farmer and grazier, who stated that large farms at reasonable rents ought not to remain long vacant. Your experience is quite different? ",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",260
"261","—I have not tried to let large farms. I would not accept an offer for a large farm.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",261
"262","9332. Have you considered the question of increasing the holdings? Could that be done with the crofting population you have?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",262
"263","—It has never been asked for.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",263
"264","9333. They could not very well leap up from their present holdings to a farm?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",264
"265","—I don't think any of them could.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",265
"266","9334. Would it be easy to increase their hill pasture in any way?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",266
"267","—I have not considered the question. It has not come before me in anyway.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",267
"268","9335. Are the rents the same?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",268
"269","—The rents have been raised 5s. in the last thirty years.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",269
"270","9336. I mean are the rents about equal, or are there some of them larger than the others?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",270
"271","—Practically, there is not much difference.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",271
"272","9337. There is not one who has two or three lots?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",272
"273","—Practically, I believe they are tolerably equal, but I have not got the figures.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",273
"274","9338. Your difficulty about the crofting population is that they could not occupy the higher ground ; but if you occupy it by deer that difficulty would disappear?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",274
"275","—I am speaking of another district. The land of which I am speaking is land which could be profitably grazed by sheep, but that which I am foresting could not profitably be grazed by sheep.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",275
"276","9339. But you stated that the rent would be double under deer, as compared with sheep?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",276
"277","—I stated that as my belief.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",277
"278","9340. Why not occupy the whole upper land with deer in that case ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",278
"279","—Because I prefer sheep where I can keep them properly. I do not wish to forest land.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",279
"280","9341. It is only the upper portion ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",280
"281","—I have never contemplated putting the lower portion under deer.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",281
"282","9342. But if it yielded a higher rent ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",282
"283","—I certainly should not do it. My desire is to have a resident population there, and I am prepared to do that at some expense. It is not my desire to raise the value of the property by what I consider an injury to it. ",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",283
"284","9343. My difficulty is in seeing why the argument should not hold good for the lower as well as the higher ground ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",284
"285","—I believe that in the one case sheep farming can be made to pay, and in the other case it can not.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",285
"286","9344. Could not the wedder ground also be made to pay, only not so highly as the deer forest 1 Is not the same argument true of the lower ground?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",286
"287","—I have farmed that place for six years at a dead loss, not only as regards rent, but as regards the interest on capital invested in stock.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",287
"288","9345. So it would not graze sheep at all ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",288
"289","—It would graze sheep, but at a dead loss for those six years.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",289
"290","9346. The loss then would be greater upon the higher ground than upon the lower ground, but still deer would be more profitable both on high ground and low ground?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",290
"291","—I have not contemplated having deer on the low ground at all. I really have not thought of it.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",291
"292","9347. The Chairman.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",292
"293","—You look forward to a very great depreciation in the value of the largest class of sheep farms all over the country?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",293
"294","—To a further depreciation?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",294
"295","9348. Yes.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",295
"296","—I do not.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",296
"297","9349. Do you then think that generally large farms could be let now to non-resident tenants or any tenants at about the same rental as in 1856 ?",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",297
"298","—I should suppose so.",163,"John Baird","Skye, Portree",298
