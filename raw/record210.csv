"1","ANGUS M'KINNON, Crofter, Linicleit (60)—examined.",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",1
"2","12067. The Chairman—Have you been freely elected a delegate?",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",2
"3","—Yes.",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",3
"4","12068. Have you a statement to make to the Commission?",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",4
"5","—Yes. We, the tenants of Linicleit, Benbecula, complain",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",5
"6","—That our crofts are now too little, being much less than what they formerly were, which may be seen from the fact that twenty additional crofters are placed among us; that our rents are too high for two reasons—",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",6
"7","(1) That continual cropping has reduced the land so much that it now yields almost nothing without double quantity of manure, and that that manure cannot be had, being divided among the increased tenants. ",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",7
"8","(2) That we have to pay, besides rent, for food for our families and provender for our cattle an average of, for the last six years, from £12 to £33, as the case may be, which, added to our rents, will show what we are, properly speaking, paying for our holdings. If all our effects were sold and the proprietrix and local merchants put in their own, very little would be left. ",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",8
"9","(3) That we have to meet these demands either from the earnings of ourselves or our families who must go to other places to earn that money, as there is no work at home. ",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",9
"10","(4) That the common and hill grazing are taken from us, except a nominal stripe of black moss more fit for peats than for grazing. Before we could be somewhat comfortable we would require a guarantee from the Government (a) that our crofts be made large enough to support our families, (b) that we shall not be at the mercy of either proprietor or his agents to remove us at will, (c) that we shall get compensation for improvements.'",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",10
"11","12069. How many crofters are there in that place ?",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",11

"19","12073. Have you got a full croft?",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",19
"20","—No, I have about nine acres of land.",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",20
"21","12074. Is it half a croft?",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",21

"29","12078. What is your rent ?",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",29
"30","—£3. I wish to state that my nine acres would not support all these animals. The nine acres would barely support one of these cows. I must expend £ 3 in purchasing summer grazing for them and also wintering.",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",30
"31","12079. Then your complaint and the complaint of your people is that your holdings are too small ?",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",31

"33","12080. What else?",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",33

"78","—The people to-day are in a condition as poor as I have ever known them to be.",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",78
"79","12103. Were they very poor at that time after the potato famine?",210,"Angus Mckinnon","Benbecula, Torlum",79
