"1","ADAM BANNERMAN, Crofter's Son, Marrel, Parish of Kildonan (27)—examined.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",1
"2","38420 Sheriff Nicolson ",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",2
"3","—How far is it from this to the place you come from?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",3
"4","—About one and a half miles—the nearest way",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",4
"5","38421 What number of families is there?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",5
"6","—Twenty-four. I have a statement to lay before the Commission I am elected by the crofters of the township of Marrel to represent them in giving evidence before the Commission. The grievances are too little land unfixity of tenure and non-compensation for improvements. Previous to the evictions on the Kildonan Strath, Marrel was occupied by four tenants, whereas there are now twentv four, each occupying about two acres in average of arable land, hardly sufficient to keep one cow and one horse. There are also about 1000 acres of hill pasture, on which we were grazing a few sheep. We were deprived of the sheep in May 1882—whether by the proprietor, or his officials, or by both, I am not prepared to say only the act of deprivation had been performed by the official under the proprietor's name. And not only that we had been deprived of the sheep, but we were forced to sign a bond to that effect there were only nine families in the parish at large who refused to sign, and these nine got summonses to quit their holdings unless they would sign the bond. And I wish to explain that these nine never said1 but they would deliver up their sheep to the Duke's officials when their neighbours would, only they would not sign to make a voluntary act of a thing contrary to their will and welfare. I may mention that the factor and ground officer, and Thomson, the head salmon fisherman, had two days' canvassing getting the people to sign this quasi-proprietor's petition. It is likely the people thought that they would be evicted if they would not sign, and the course adopted towards the few who refused to sign confirmed that. There are five tenants in Marrel which had been rented so much per head for grazing a few sheep on the hill pasture. The sheep have been taken from them, but still they pay sheep rent. Now that hill pasture is of no use to the crofters, it is not fit for cattle or horses, so that it is now left to the adjoining tacksman's sheep—they go and come daily as they choose; so that we can count from fifty to one hundred sheep daily on average all over the tenant's ground, so that the crofters cannot understand how it is that they have been deprived of their few sheep, and their grazing ground left with them, but stocked with the tacksman's sheep. I made the remark in the former part of my statement that the main grievance was too little land, and the only remedy for that is more land, fixity of tenure, and compensation for improvements. There is plenty of land lying waste in all parts of Sutherlandshire and in this part of it as well, especially the Kildonan Strath, where our forefathers were burnt out, in which there is sufficient land; if divided right, it would bring more money to the proprietor than by sheep farms, and supply a small farm to every third crofter crammed on others on the sea-side, where they hold crofts only sufficient to support them for four months in the year; whereas the only thing that would make a crofter comfortable would be to have as much land as would support him all the year round, say thirty to fifty acres of arable land, and hill pasture accordingly.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",6

"22","38429. Was any reason given for taking that pasture from them?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",22
"23","—Not that I am aware of, except that the sheep might have been trespassing sometimes on the neighbours—on the same crofters. The whole of them had sheep except four. I understand they all had sheep except those.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",23
"24","38430. Had there been any complaint made by any of the crofters against their neighbours?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",24

"26","38431. Had they been, in point of fact, trespassing upon their neighbours?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",26

"42","38439. Can they not keep more cattle?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",42

"44","38440. Is not the grass that the sheep feed upon also fit to be food for cows?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",44

"51","—Not since my recollection.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",51
"52","38444. Whose duty was it to keep it up?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",52

"73","—Yes, a good number of them.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",73
"74","38456. But if they are near enough to the sea to gather whelks, why have they not boats to go and get fish also?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",74
"75","—Some of them would never return if they got boats.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",75
"76","38457. Is their dread of the sea so great that they would prefer not to go?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",76
"77","—Yes, so great; and it is so awkward that they prefer the crofting business. They are no fishermen whatever.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",77
"78","38458. Have there never been fishermen there?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",78
"79","—Yes, there have.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",79
"80","38459. Why did they give it up?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",80
"81","—Because they could not attend to the croft and the fishery.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",81
"82","38460. Do they find any work in the neighbourhood?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",82

"92","38465. And you say there is no work except at the herring fishing?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",92

"145","38491. Were you going to defend the case?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",145

"147","38492. And what came of it?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",147

"155","38496. And what did he state for you? What was the nature of your defence?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",155
"156","—Really I could not say what the defence was, because I was not there.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",156
"157","38497. You are a delegate, and you ought to tell us all about it. There was a lawyer instructed to see after the case for your mother and others at the court; what did he say for you?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",157
"158","—I am not prepared to say.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",158
"159","—[Mr Sutherland. The agent craved delay till the case was considered by his Grace the Duke of Sutherland, and ultimately the case was compromised, and was withdrawn.]",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",159
"160","38498. Apparently some of the people in Marrel made a complaint to his Grace or to the estate officials that your sheep were trespassing upon their ground, and that was the alleged reason, was it not, why you were ordered to put them away?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",160
"161","—I am not aware that they ever complained to his Grace.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",161
"162","38499. But you said yourself that that was said to be the reason?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",162
"163","—Yes, but not to his Grace. It was that they had complained to the ground officer.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",163
"164","38500. Has there been any complaint on the part of these people to anybody whatever connected with the estate for the trespass of the tenants' sheep upon them? You say there are plenty of sheep on the ground now?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",164

"168","38502. Why?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",168
"169","—Because they thought there was no use—that the tenant was to get the benefit whatever.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",169
"170","38503. They were afraid?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",170
"171","—Yes.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",171
"172","38504. Or, at all events, it would be of no use?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",172
"173","—No use.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",173
"174","38505. I suppose you think it rather hard, after being deprived of your own sheep, to see other people's sheep on your ground?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",174
"175","—By all means.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",175
"176","38506. I suppose the tenants of Marrel were scrimp enough before this happened?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",176
"177","—Too scrimp.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",177
"178","38507. And this has not improved your condition?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",178
"179","—Yes, for the worse. ",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",179
"180","38508. You stated, in the paper you gave in, that your forefathers had been removed from Kildonan. How long had your people been in this country?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",180

"182","38509. Where did the first of them come from originally?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",182

"184","38510. Is there plenty of land in your immediate neighbourhood where by the twenty-four crofters could be made comfortable?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",184
"185","—Yes, within eye sight.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",185
"186","38511. Is there only one big tenant between you and the march with Caithness?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",186

"190","—Yes.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",190
"191","38513. Then the only time the sheep could trespass on the crofts was in the winter?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",191
"192","—Occasionally.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",192
"193","38514. Did the complaint refer to trespassing in summer or trespassing in winter?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",193
"194","—There was a little in both winter and summer.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",194
"195","38515. Do the tenants in your place sow grass seeds?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",195
"196","—Yes.",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",196
"197","38516. Did they complain of the sheep eating up the young grass on their croft land? Was that their complaint?",634,"Adam Bannerman","Sutherland, Helmsdale",197
