"29","advantage",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",29
"30","21309. What do you do with the lambs —are they grazed?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",30
"31","—Some of them; but I generally sell them to some person or ship them on my own account to the southern market.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",31
"32","21310. Which kind do you find thrives best?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",32
"33","—That is sometimes a matter of opinion; one man might have one opinion, and another a different opinion; but both kinds, I think thrive in a fair way in Shetland.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",33
"34","21311. Do you keep any cows?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",34

"44","21316. Therefore that breed would not suit the poorer tenants?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",44

"68","—Have you any right to scathold land near you?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",68
"69","—Not according to my lease. My predecessor, I believe, claimed a right to it.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",69
"70","21328. Do you know if the 500 acres of your farm ever formed part of the scathold ?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",70
"71","—I believe they did.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",71
"72","21329. Have you heard if it caused any dissatisfaction to your crofter neighbours when that part was cut off the scathold?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",72
"73","—No, it is an isolated part almost surrounded by the sea.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",73
"74","21330. So that they would not have got much advantage from it?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",74
"75","—If they had it, with the rest of the property, it would have been an advantage; but I don't think the want of it hurts them.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",75

"80","21333. What kind of cabbage is grown?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",80
"81","—I suppose it is a kind belonging to Shetland—what is called Shetland kail.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",81
"82","21334. Is it Scotch kail or drumhead ",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",82
"83","—Drumhead.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",83
"84","21335. Have you anything to remark about the grievances of the people here?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",84
"85","—No, I might, perhaps, pass an opinion upon the scathold. I think, in the first place, there ought to be a division of the scathold between the heritors; and in the next place, in my opinion, the crofters would be benefited if they were limited to a certain number of sheep stock. It could easily be ascertained what stock each proprietor scathold would keep, and then it could be ascertained how many could be allotted to each holding, to keep them comfortable. According to the present state of things, in my opinion, if a bad winter came, a person owning 100 or 300 sheep might lose the half of them.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",85
"86","21336. In fact, there is great waste from the present mode of stocking the scathold?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",86

"88","21337. The Chairman.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",88
"89","—Is your farm fenced?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",89
"90","—It is fenced chiefly by the sea, and what is not so fenced is enclosed by stone dykes.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",90
"91","21338. Is there any portion of your grazing which might be converted into arable land?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",91
"92","—Not much of mine; but on other parts there is a great deal of land which might be brought under cultivation.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",92
"93","21339. Is the system of tile subsoil draining practised in this parish?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",93
"94","—Not to my knowledge.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",94
"95","21340. You never saw a tile drain in this parish?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",95
"96","—No, I don't think so.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",96

"103","21344. Is lime extensively used?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",103
"104","—Only for building and repairing houses.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",104
"105","21345. It is not used for cultivation?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",105
"106","—Not to my knowledge.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",106
"107","21346. You never saw a ton of lime laid on the land in this parish? ",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",107
"108","—No, I never did.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",108
"109","21347. Would it be beneficial to this soil?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",109
"110","—Yes, I think it would, I have thought of trying it.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",110
"111","21348. Are there any stipulations in your lease about improving?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",111
"112","— No, and no compensation clause.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",112
"113","21349. Did the landlord place the building in good order?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",113
"114","—They were in a fair state of repair, and I am obliged to leave them in that state of repair or something nearly approaching to it; something might be allowed for natural decay.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",114
"115","21350. If you had a claim for compensation would you be inclined to lay out something in improvements?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",115
"116","—Certainly, I have improved a good deal without a claim for compensation or any expectation of getting it.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",116
"117","21351. What is the duration of your lease ?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",117
"118","—It was an old lease I took up, and there were eight years to run when I got it.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",118
"119","21352. How many years are there remaining to run?",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",119
"120","—Four, I think.",372,"John Macpherson","Shetland, Hillswick",120
