"1","JOHN M'CUAIG, Crofter and Fisherman (54), assisted by JOHN M'PHEE, Crofter, Corran, Arnisdale (60)—examined.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",1
"2","31710. The Chairman. ",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",2
"3","—Have you been elected a delegate?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",3
"4","—I believe I was.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",4
"5","31711. Are you sure?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",5
"6","—I am.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",6
"7","31712. Have you any written statement to produce?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",7
"8","—No.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",8
"9","31713. Then what have you to say on behalf of your people?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",9
"10","—They are wanting more land. None of those in the township in which I live have more than one acre of land each, and that is too little for them to bring up their families on. We would be indebted to our proprietor or any person who would give us more, because there is land that might be given to us. There is plenty of low land in Arnisdale that might be given to poor people. The acre of land which we have we consider too dear at £2 of rent. We have no hill pasture or anything beyond that one acre of land. Three or four keep a cow, but neither I nor my neighbours are able to keep one. Those who do keep a cow pasture it upon the land of the farm and pay for it. We pay £ 3 for the grazing for the whole year. ",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",10
"11","31714. Where did the people of your township come from ; have they been long there, or did they come from another place?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",11
"12","—I believe they are all people belonging to the place without any admixture of strangers. ",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",12
"13","31715. In old times what was the condition of the people —your fathers and grandfathers?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",13
"14","—They were in a hard enough condition ; but they were in a better condition, so far as I know, than the people are to-day.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",14
"15","31716. Had they in those times any hill pasture?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",15
"16","—They had the hill; but there is an older man than I can tell about that.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",16
"17","31717. Do you know when the hill was taken away?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",17
"18","—It was taken away, I think, in the time of a proprietor called Bruce.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",18
"19","31718. Who is the older man?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",19
"20","—John M'Phee.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",20
"21","31719. Had the people any hill pasture in this place in former times?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",21
"22","—M'Phee. They had hill pasture in the time when Lord Glenelg was proprietor.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",22
"23","31720. Was it large?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",23
"24","—Yes; it pastured eighty cattle and sheep—I cannot tell how many sheep. It was then taken from them in the time of Lord Glenelg, before the property was sold to Mr Baillie.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",24
"25","31721. By whom is the land occupied now?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",25
"26","—Mr Milligan, farmer. Our rent remained the same as it was after the hill was taken from us.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",26
"27","31722. When the hill was taken away did you then remain with one acre each of arable land?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",27
"28","—Yes.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",28
"29","31723. And did you pay the same rent for the one acre that you did for the one acre and the common pasture?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",29
"30","—Yes, till this day—£2 for the acre of land and £ 3 for the grazing of a cow.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",30
"31","31724. Do you all keep cows to graze out at £3?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",31
"32","—No; there are only tliree milk cows in our district, and we think the rent very high for them, the ground which they pasture being very bad.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",32
"33","31725. What do you grow on the arable ground?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",33
"34","—Very little; floods come upon one half of it, and make it incapable of bearing crop. Two bolls of potatoes were all that I took out of mine last year.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",34
"35","31726. Do you grow any winter fodder on the arable ground for the cattle, or do you use the arable ground entirely for your own food?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",35
"36","—It is out of the ocean that I take my own food. I cannot get a living out of the ground. Potatoes have grown on the same land for the last sixty years.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",36
"37","31727. When you pay £ 3 for the cow does that include the food of the cow for the whole year, or have you to buy fodder for the cow besides?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",37
"38","—It does not include the hay which we have to buy for them in the winter.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",38
"39","31728. How much will it cost a man to buy hay for winter besides the £3?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",39
"40","—From Whitsunday of last year to Whitsunday of this year it cost me between that £3 for what I had to pay for food for her in addition, £12, 5s. 4d.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",40
"41","31729. Is that the cost generally, or was it an extra year?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",41
"42","—My cow was more expensive to me than those of the rest; some cows require more food than others.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",42
"43","31730. You say you want more land; is the hill pasture which was taken away from you adjacent to your arable ground?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",43
"44","—-M'Cuaig. Yes, just above us.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",44
"45","31731. And does it contain arable ground as well as bill pasture?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",45
"46","—Plenty.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",46
"47","31732. Could a portion of it be taken from the farm and given to the township without altogether spoiling the farm?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",47
"48","—Yes; the farm would still be a good farm without it. The hill pasture which was ours before was taken away from the farm and given to us.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",48
"49","31733. Has the rent of your acre of arable land been raised?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",49
"50","—No; it has neither been raised nor lowered from what it was when we had the hill pasture.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",50
"51","31734. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",51
"52","—How many tenants are there in Corran now?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",52
"53","—There are fifteen tenants, with 13½ acres amongst them; they are penned there like sheep in a fold. There are upwards of fiftythree souls existing upon that bit of land.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",53
"54","31735. How many families were there in the time of Lord Glenelg?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",54
"55","—There were many more in that time; some of them went away to America. The factor at that time, James Stavert, took their land to himself. He kept to himself all the lands of these people who went",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",55
"56","away to America, and it has been attached to the farm since that time.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",56
"57","31736. Had your predecessors in Corran in Lord Glenelg's time more arable land individually than the people there have now?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",57
"58","—Some had two acres; most of them had only one acre, but they had the hill besides.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",58
"59","31737. How many crofters were there among whom the eighty cows were divided?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",59
"60","—I cannot say how many. There were only one or two had two acres, the rest had one acre, and some had no land at all. These latter had a cow, and they got grazing from others who had the bill.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",60
"61","31738. Would the tenants of those days have more than one cow apiece?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",61
"62","—Some had two milk cows and three and four young beasts on the hill besides.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",62
"63","31739. Had those who had an acre of land in those days more than one cow?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",63
"64","—No, they had only one cow ; but they had other beasts besides on the hill.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",64
"65","31740. How did they winter these beasts if they had more than one cow?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",65
"66","—They were Highland cattle, and they stood out the whole winter, except when the snow came, and then they gave them a bite of something. There was more pasture on the bill then; it was very good compared with what it is now —dirtied by sheep.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",66
"67","31741. Professor Mackinnon.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",67
"68","—I understand the factor took into his own hands the arable land of those who went away and the hill pasture of the whole township?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",68
"69","—He had the hill pasture before that: but he took the arable land of the people who went to America.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",69
"70","31742. And afterwards both the hill pasture and that arable land were added to the farm as it now is?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",70
"71","—Yes.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",71
"72","31743. When did these people go away?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",72
"73","—Upwards of thirty-four years ago.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",73
"74","31744. To America?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",74
"75","—Yes.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",75
"76","31745. To Canada, I suppose?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",76
"77","—Yes.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",77
"78","31746. What part?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",78
"79","—The county of Glengarry.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",79
"80","31747. Have you heard from them since?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",80
"81","—Not many are alive now of those who went there.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",81
"82","31748. What is the condition of those who are alive, and of the children of those that are dead?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",82
"83","—There were some of them for whom it would have been as well had they remained at home, but those who had strong families got on well.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",83
"84","31749. Did they go of their own accord, or were they sent away?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",84
"85","—They went voluntarily. Some of them after getting on board the ship went ashore again, not wishing to go; but they were not allowed to remain, and their houses were pulled down over their beads, and they were forced to embark again.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",85
"86","31750. Were they assisted to go away?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",86
"87","—They got their passage ; Mr Baillie paid for their passage. ",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",87
"88","31751. The present proprietor?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",88
"89","—The predecessor of the present proprietor.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",89
"90","31752. If that ground which your neighbours had, instead of being taken by the factor, had been given to you, would that have very much and improved your condition?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",90
"91","—Yes, if we got the hill pasture as the boundaries were before, we would be quite satisfied.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",91
"92","31753. You were not benefited in the least by your neighbours going away to America?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",92
"93","—It did us no good, it injured us rather; it tightened us more than we were.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",93
"94","31754. How did it make you worse?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",94
"95","—It took no land from us, but it did us no good; we got none of what our friends had.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",95
"96","31755. But your circumstances would be very much improved if you still got what they had along with the hill pasture that you had before?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",96
"97","—There can be no doubt of that.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",97
"98","31756. And you would be willing to pay a reasonable rent if you got it?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",98
"99","—We would.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",99
"100","31757. [To M'Phee].",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",100
"101","—Do you consider also, along with your neighbour, that the rent you pay for the acre is too high?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",101
"102","—There is no doubt of it ; it is only £ 1 per acre on the rest of the estate.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",102
"103","31758. You pay £ 2 , and the rest of the estate only pay £ 1 per acre; is that what you mean?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",103
"104","—Yes, it is only £ 1 per acre on the tenantry, except us, on this side of Glenelg.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",104
"105","31759. Is your ground better, or have you better fishing ground beside you?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",105
"106","—Nothing did it but the will of Stavert, the factor. As he had the farm himself, he thought he could get the place depopulated altogether.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",106
"107","31760. Was that the reason why, when he took the hill pasture from you, he did not reduce the rent?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",107
"108","—Yes; the part that he took to himself which the tenants had before, he got a man to value, and he valued it at 7s. 6d. an acre, and it is at that rate that he paid for it himself.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",108
"109","31761. And was that piece as good as the piece for which you now are paying £ 2?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",109
"110","—It was quite the same, except that it was more convenient to him.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",110
"111","31762. Have you a school in the place?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",111
"112","—Yes.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",112
"113","31763. A good school?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",113
"114","—[M'Cuaig] It is better this year than last year.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",114
"115","31764. Do your children all go to school?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",115
"116","—Yes; it was a female teacher we had before, and we have a male teacher now, whom we consider",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",116
"117","better.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",117
"118","31765. You prefer a male teacher?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",118
"119","—Yes, undoubtedly.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",119
"120","31766. All along, since you remember, have you been paying rent direct to the proprietor, or did you hold your land from the farmer?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",120
"121","—It is to the proprietor we have always paid the £ 2 , but to the farmer the £3 for the grazing since the hill was taken from us.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",121
"122","31767. Was that always the case before Stavert's time?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",122
"123","—Yes. We never paid to the farmer until the hill pasture was taken from us—we always paid to the laird.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",123
"124","31768. Which do you consider the highest rent, £ 2 for an acre of arable ground or £ 3 for as much as a cow can gather on the hill side?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",124
"125","—[M'Phee]. The ground is the more useful to me ; the cow is dear, dear; if she were feeding on good ground I should not think it so bad.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",125
"126","31769. You don't think she can take £ 3 worth off the ground upon which she is allowed to feed?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",126
"127","—Not £ 1 worth; it is not there for her; the sheep don't leave that to her.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",127
"128","31770. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",128
"129","—Is there a great scarcity of milk in the township?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",129
"130","—It cannot be otherwise, when there are only three milk cows in th eplace",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",130
"131","31771. How many children may there be in the township?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",131
"132","—[M'Cuaig]. I should say twenty-four or twenty-five.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",132
"133","31772. Has any proprietor lived on this estate during the last fifty years?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",133
"134","—[M’Phee]Not to our recollection.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",134
"135","31773. Have you any idea how many times the late proprietor, Evan Baillie, visited the estate during the time he was in possession?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",135
"136","—I am not aware that he ever came to our side. He may have come to this side.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",136
"137","31774. Was the predecessor of Evan Baillie long proprietor of the estate?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",137
"138","—I cannot be certain.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",138
"139","31775. Was he the one who bought it from the Grants?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",139
"140","—Yes.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",140
"141","31776. Did you ever see him?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",141
"142","—I saw him once.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",142
"143","31777. How long have you been paying rent?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",143
"144","—About thirty years.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",144
"145","31778. Did you ever receive any benefit directly or indirectly from the proprietor?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",145
"146","—I got some benefit from him the year before last, when the great tide came. I got a reduction of about £2 of arrears.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",146
"147","31779. Did you ever get any assistance in your buildings?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",147
"148","—No ; I am well acquainted with the sea coming into the place where I live.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",148
"149","31780. Did any of the crofters in Corran ever receive any advantage from the proprietor in the shape of buddings or otherwise?",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",149
"150","—Never, so far as I am aware.",537,"John Mccuaig, John Mcphee","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",150
