"1","DONALD MUNRO, Crofter, Strathan (48)—examined.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",1
"2","27510. Sheriff Nicolson",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",2
"3","—Are you a fisherman?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",3
"4","—Not now.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",4
"5","27511. Have you a statement to make?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",5
"6","—Yes.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",6
"7","27512. Just read it?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",7
"8","— We beg to ask the Royal Commission to allow us to say a few words at the beginning of our statement, to tell how the people of Inverkirkag, Badinaban, and Strathan, came to such poverty. At one time their ancestors peopled the glens, and other portions of arable land that lie inland. They lived then chiefly by their cattle. They had a good number of them and had plenty provender to keep them in good condition during the winter months. They were thus in easy and comfortable circumstances. The then Duke, from some motive unknown to us, removed them. Some sought shelter in foreign lands, the others were crammed in small townships near the shores. The lots there were divided to the people of each township so that when each family got their share it was very small. This land was cultivated by, and came down from sire to son, so that now it has become so poor that the people have to force a crop with manure. The people are now so poor that they cannot emigrate if they wished, or take a much larger holding then they have. They cannot improve their land much more than they have already done, as it is limited in extent and very poor. At the death of the parents the son has to pay yearly an additional sum of 7s. 6d. or more for getting his name in the rent roll books. The people are also poor from the want of work. The father of one of the present crofters of Assynt was only paying £20 for the township of Inverkirkag. That township now pays upwards of £50, although it has been reduced in size and is occupied by fifteen crofters besides cottars. The township of Badinaban, two generations ago, was occupied by four crofters each paying a rent of £1, 15s. That township now pays upwards of £20, and is occupied by nine crofters. The people have no fixity of rent or tenure. In order to raise the people out of their present condition they would require to get more land, either more hill pasture or the arable land that now lies waste under sheep and deer. There could be very good and comfortable townships formed on the said land, each tenant paying a rent of £10 to £15, but unless they got help from either Government or proprietor, or from both, they could not stock this land; but should Government or proprietor, or both, give this loan, and some time to pay it —say fifty years—at a rate of £ 3 per cent, interest, and the first rent to be paid two years after the tenant settles in his new home. This would raise the crofter once again. Another way would be to give the hill pasture as aforesaid, and work draining the ground on those large sheep farms where now the brackens and rushes grow, and keeping the ground from being overrun by heather. Those who seek to better their condition by fishing would wish a curing station or two at Lochinver, and the East Coast fishermen have repeatedly said that they would fish so much per cran less at Lochinver than they would at Stornoway, if they had conveniences for a station there, as it is more convenient to the fishing ground. The people also wish fixity of tenure and rent.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",8

"19","—I cannot tell.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",19
"20","27518. Were any of them removed from Strathnaver?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",20
"21","—From the heights of their own parish.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",21
"22","27519. What rent do you pay yourself?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",22
"23","—£7, 17s. 6d.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",23

"25","—Yes.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",25
"26","27521. What stock do you keep?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",26

"29","—About six acres or a little more perhaps.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",29
"30","27523. Are you able to raise crop enough for your family or for your cattle?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",30
"31","—Not for the family, but enough for the cattle.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",31
"32","27524. What sort of soil have you?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",32
"33","—Very bad.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",33
"34","27525. Is it the same in each of these townships?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",34
"35","—No, it is better in some. ",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",35
"36","27526. Is it rocky or boggy, or both?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",36
"37","—Both.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",37
"38","27527. Do you consider your rent too high?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",38
"39","—No.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",39
"40","27528. But you want more land?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",40
"41","—More land.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",41
"42","27529. Are there any large sheep farms close upon your boundary?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",42
"43","—It is only deer forest now.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",43
"44","27530. What forest is that?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",44
"45","—Glencanisp forest",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",45
"46","27531. When was it made a forest?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",46
"47","—Two or three years ago.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",47
"48","27532. It was a sheep farm before that?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",48
"49","—Yes.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",49
"50","27533. Is it sufficiently fenced to keep the deer from getting into the crofts?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",50
"51","—No.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",51
"52","27534. Do they go over the fence?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",52
"53","—They can go over it; it is only",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",53
"54","about 3½  feet high. There are not many deer yet.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",54
"55","27535. Will it be of any use to protect your crops when the deer increase in numbers?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",55
"56","—We don't know yet; but they would spoil the crops I know.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",56
"57","27536. But does it keep your cattle from going over it?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",57
"58","—It will do that sufficiently—it is a barbed fence.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",58
"59","27537. Why was it made a barbed fence?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",59
"60","—So as to pierce any beast that would attempt to leap over it; that is our belief,",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",60
"61","27538. Is there no work going on around or near you of which you could get the benefit.?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",61
"62","—There may be a little now and again, but far too little for the population of the place.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",62
"63","27539. Have you a good place for landing when you come back from the fishing?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",63
"64","—Yes, the coast is very good for landing; but we thought it would be a greater benefit to the place if the curers would come to it as they go to Stornoway. ",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",64
"65","27540. Are all your men fishermen more or less?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",65
"66","—Almost all. ",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",66
"67","27541. Do they go to the East Coast fishing?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",67
"68","—Yes.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",68
"69","27542. What kind of fishing do you engage in at home?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",69
"70","—Very little home fishing is done. There was a boat here the other day that had 200 cod fish, and they could not get them sold.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",70
"71","27543. Is there nobody in Lochinver who could take them?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",71
"72","—Not a soul. ",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",72
"73","27544. Do you never try your hand at curing the fish yourselves?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",73
"74","—No.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",74
"75","27545. Has it never been done here?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",75
"76","—There were curers once.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",76
"77","27546. But you never tried to cure fish and send it away yourselves?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",77
"78","—No.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",78
"79","27547. If you had the curers once, why did they abandon it?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",79
"80","—I think it was because the fish got scarcer, and it was not worth the while of the fishermen to prosecute it.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",80
"81","27548. How long is it since the fishing became less productive?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",81
"82","—A good many years ago; but I may mention about twelve years ago especially, since it has ceased to be productive.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",82
"83","27549. The Chairman.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",83
"84","—Do you salt fish for your own domestic consumption ?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",84
"85","—Yes",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",85
"86","27550. Is fish a large part of the diet of the people in their own houses?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",86
"87","—Yes",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",87
"88","27551. Sheriff Nicolson.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",88

"90","—No.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",90
"91","27552. What else do you do to support yourself and your family?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",91
"92","—I get a little work about the place when I can take work, and I must just live as I may.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",92
"93","27553. You don't go the south to work?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",93
"94","—No.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",94
"95","27554. What size of croft do you think would support you, and what rent would you consider fair for it?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",95
"96","—This is not a place for crofting, and one expends a great deal of labour in cultivating it with the spade, and cas-chrom.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",96
"97","27555. You still use the cas-chrom?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",97
"98","—Yes.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",98
"99","27556. Is the land not fit to be ploughed?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",99
"100","—There are very few places where the horses could work it.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",100
"101","27557. Because the ground is so rocky?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",101
"102","—So rocky. The whole place is far more suitable for rearing cattle, and a little cultivation.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",102
"103","27558. Would you like to have some pasture to breed cattle and sheep, even although you should buy food for them?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",103
"104","—Yes",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",104
"105","27559. But there is no land near you except the deer forest available for the purpose?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",105
"106","—No.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",106
"107","27560. Have the Inverkirkaig people horses?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",107
"108","—Yes.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",108
"109","27561. The same as you or more?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",109
"110","—The same.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",110
"111","27562. Has everybody a horse?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",111
"112","—Some of them have; it would not be worth while for them all to keep horses, the bit they have is so small.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",112
"113","27563. Are there any cottars amongst you?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",113
"114","—Yes.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",114
"115","27564. Many?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",115
"116","—Not very many.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",116
"117","27565. How do they live?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",117
"118","—They get bits of the township as we have ourselves, and they just do as best they may.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",118
"119","27566. Where do they get work?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",119
"120","—They get a little here. They can attend to their work even better than the crofters, because they have",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",120
"121","no land to look after.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",121
"122","27567. Does it support the people?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",122
"123","—They must live as they can.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",123
"124","27568. What kind of work do they get? Is there any draining, or building of dykes?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",124
"125","—No. There is very little work at all. This year, for example, there is a walk being made through the forest, but that is exceptional. Then there is a fence being set up between the deer forest and the crofts, and that too is special. The people are away at the south and east coast fishing. Were it not for these two things they might go where they pleased, they have nothing else to do.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",125
"126","27569. Are there many young men employed in the forest?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",126
"127","—Very few, if any.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",127
"128","27570. Are any of them employed here attending anglers?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",128
"129","—Yes.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",129
"130","27571. I suppose in summer some have steady employment at that?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",130
"131","—Not very steady.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",131
"132","27572. And not very many of them?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",132
"133","—No.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",133
"134","27573. How many men in your place would find occupation in attending upon anglers hereabout?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",134
"135","—About half-a-dozen.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",135
"136","27574. Have you a good supply of peats?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",136
"137","—Plenty.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",137
"138","27575. Do you carry them on horses?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",138
"139","—No, we carry them on the people's backs.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",139
"140","27576. Do the men ever condescend to carry them, or is it the women who do that work?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",140
"141","—Both.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",141
"142","27577. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",142
"143","—You have said in your paper that at the death of the parents the son has to pay yearly an additional sum of 7s. 6d. or more for getting his name in the rent roll books?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",143
"144","—I have been told that.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",144
"145","27578. Do you know yourself of any case? did anybody who paid this rent tell you?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",145
"146","—Yes, I am aware of a man who told me he paid it himself, and I believe he is in here. I don't pay it myself; I am not on the rent roll.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",146
"147","27579. Has this system been going on for some years?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",147
"148","—I am certain that it has been.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",148
"149","27580. Can you say that since you have been old enough to take notice of things about you, you heard of this?",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",149
"150","—It certainly has been a subject of complaint at all events for the last ten or fifteen years.",461,"Donald Munro","Sutherland, Lochinver",150
