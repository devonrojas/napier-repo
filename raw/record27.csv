"1","PETER M'DONALD, Crofter, Glen Hinisdale (51)—examined. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",1
"2","1556. The Chairman.",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",2
"3","—You have a written statement to read to the Commission?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",3
"4","—Yes. At a meeting of crofters in Glen Hinisdale on 26 May 1883,—Malcolm M'Leod, crofter, in the chair,—a resolution was passed and carried. The principal cause of our grievance is the repeated rising of our rent. When Major Fraser got the estate, our rents were from £5, 3s. to £5,10s., and he raised it to £11 and £13,10s., with the exception of two crofts, whose rents were when he became proprietor £11, and he raised them to £24, 10s. and £25, also an assessment of 2s. 5d. per £1, rendering our condition such that, should our rents be reduced to the sum it was when Major Fraser became proprietor, it would take a considerable time before we could clear ourselves from our just debts. Of fifteen  crofters our liabilities amount to over £600 sterling, and with but few exceptions our credit is gone also; our stock is unsaleable at this time, owing to their impoverished condition. Our grazing will not carry more than half the stock assigned to it; the death-rate is excessive both summer and winter ; some of us at times lose perhaps the half of his small number. Concerning the cultivating land, the soil is so poor, that on an average for six years back, if any of us makes a boll or two of meal from his own oats, he must buy sowing seed. Our houses are scarcely habitable, which we cannot repair owing to our being so poor, and for want of lime and wood.  We also suffer great inconvenience from the want of our roads, which were destroyed by the great flood of 1877, and never was repaired, although we  pay for roads, and have done so for a considerable time. We pray that the Royal Commission will give us the land in a way that we can live on, and in such a way that the proprietor cannot raise our rent or remove us, although we would improve our lands. (Signed) MALCOLM M'LEOD.'",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",4

"24","1566. Is there anything else that you would like to say?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",24

"76","1592. Then it is not the case generally that the people cannot keep the summing of their place?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",76

"89","— Yes, often. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",89
"90","1599. The crofters ask that they should get the croft in such a way that the proprietor could not raise their rents if they improved the land. Would their lands bear improvement ?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",90
"91","—Yes, some of them are improvable ; the land is bad, but some of it is improvable. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",91

"99","—Yes. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",99

"112","1610. Did those who improved most suffer the greatest rise?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",112

"123","—Yes, those who are in Australia are doing well. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",123
"124","1615. Are there any people in this country who would care to go to Australia if there were means provided?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",124
"125","—I do not know, but I believe there are. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",125
"126","1616. You mentioned they are £600 in debt. Are those debts to the meal-dealers, to the landlord, or to the bank principally?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",126
"127","—Both to the landlord and the meal-dealer and the bank. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",127
"128","1617. To go back about five years, what would be the amount of the debts on the place then?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",128
"129","—I cannot say; not the third part of that. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",129
"130","1618. What is the difference between your own indebtedness now and your indebtedness five years ago ?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",130
"131","—I was not in debt at all five years ago. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",131

"153","—He was going to give us two years' rent back, and to take our effects at a valuation. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",153
"154","1629. Where was it proposed you should emigrate to?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",154
"155","—Some of them were thinking of going to America and to Australia, and others could not emigrate at all. There were those who could not pay the cart to take their effects to Portree. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",155
"156","1630. Were some of you willing to go?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",156
"157","—Yes. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",157
"158","1631. Most of the people, I think?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",158
"159","—I believe so. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",159
"160","1632. What was the reason why the thing was broken off?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",160
"161","—I do not know. Some of them drew back. We believed that those who drew back had been bribed to do so,—bought to do so. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",161

"168","1636. And then you considered that the agreement was broken by that, and that you were not bound to go?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",168
"169","—The landlord drew back from his promise.",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",169
"170","1637. Because you would not all go ?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",170
"171","—Yes.",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",171

"192","1648. Who is the clerk?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",192
"193","—Mr Macdonald, Portree, factor.",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",193

"203","—There is no occasion for him to visit us when there is no schoolmaster.",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",203

"212","—It would be little enough. Ten acres of ground will not on any part of this estate keep six cows. It would not keep three cows with us. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",212
"213","1658. Of course arable land is meant,—the wintering?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",213
"214","—Yes.",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",214
"215","1659. Now, on your croft you have six cows and what you have told us. Do you consider that enough to keep a family for the whole year?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",215
"216","—It would not support a family for a month, without live stock.",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",216

"219","1661. What do you sell off your croft in the shape of cattle and sheep and wool ?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",219
"220","—About three wedders, each tenant, on an average. That was the case last year.",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",220
"221","1662. How many cattle?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",221

"236","—We can only leave out very little of it, and it would require very much manure to put it in heart to yield any crop. It would go back to heather in three years. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",236

"253","1678. What would you consider a fair rent for your holding?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",253

"264","—I was thinking that the landlord could keep them to the agreement when every one of them had signed it. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",264

"277","—I was much the worse of it. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",277
"278","1690. Did you go to the place which you call the worst part upon the property, because there was no other place open to you ?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",278

"289","—It was not Mr Urquhart who had the place then. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",289
"290","1696. Who was it?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",290
"291","—The landlord himself had the land first which Mr Urquhart has now. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",291

"293","—Twenty families were in the upper part, and more, and cottars besides ; and twenty-three families from the lower ground. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",293

"303","—You stated that the rent of the crofts in your place had been raised two or three times. Is that the case?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",303
"304","—Yes. ",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",304
"305","1703. When the rents were raised, did the crofters make an earnest remonstrance to the proprietor, and represent that it would be a hardship ?",27,"Peter Mcdonald","Skye, Uig",305
