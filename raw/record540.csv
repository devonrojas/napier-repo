"1","JAMES MILLIGAN, Farmer, Arnisdale (46)—examined.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",1
"2","32045. The Chairman.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",2
"3","—You are the tenant of a farm in this vicinity?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",3
"4","—Yes.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",4
"5","32046. How long have you been in it?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",5
"6","—Since 1874.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",6
"7","32047. Are you a tenant in any other farm of the Highlands?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",7
"8","—Yes ; Glenhuirich and Drimnaloram, both in Argyleshire.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",8
"9","32048. I think you have also some interest in land in the south'!",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",9
"10","—Yes.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",10
"11","32049. In Dumfriesshire and Lanarkshire?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",11
"12","—I have.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",12
"13","32050. Are these farms principally sheep farms?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",13
"14","—The Dumfriesshire farm is arable, but the others are mainly pasture.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",14
"15","32051. Having all these large concerns on your hands, you are not able, I suppose, to be a permanent resident in this district?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",15
"16","—Not quite.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",16
"17","32052. But is this your principal dwelling place?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",17
"18","—No, I live for the most part in Dumfriesshire.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",18
"19","32053. Do you come here at stated periods of the year?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",19
"20","—Yes, and my wife and family come and reside here for two or three months in the year.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",20
"21","32054. Do you keep a manager here, or simply shepherds?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",21
"22","—Principally shepherds; a manager and other shepherds.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",22
"23","32055. You have been here during the examination to-day, and you have heard it stated that a portion of the farm which you occupy here was formerly occupied as common pasture for small tenants?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",23
"24","—Yes, I heard that.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",24
"25","32056. Was it in that condition when you took the farm, or had it already been given to a farmer before you came?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",25
"26","—It had been for a long time in the state in which I got it.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",26
"27","32057. There has been no change since you got it?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",27
"28","—No, with the exception of ten acres that my predecessor Mr Mitchell got, which belonged to some of the crofters. I don't know whether it was rented as one whole field or in different crofts, but I know he had it separately from the rest of the farm.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",28
"29","32058. Is that now consolidated with the farm?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",29
"30","—It is.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",30
"31","32059. Do you find that the small tenants are very anxious to get pasture from you for their cows?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",31
"32","—They don't appear very anxious. I may state that the arrangement with the factor when I took the land was that it was to be enclosed for the crofters' cows ; and when I wished that part of my lease fulfilled, I said they were bound to do so; and the factor said they were not bound to continue the crofters' cows, but would rather do away with the cows than enclose the land; so that the cows remain as they were, and the prices fixed for the grazing also, and all is just as it was before I got it. I was unwilling that people's cows should be done away with. It is a great advantage to the crofters, or to any person with a family, to have milk, and they just remained as they had been previously under the former tenant.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",32
"33","32060. There was a condition in the lease that a piece of ground should be enclosed for a specified number of crofters' cows : how many?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",33
"34","—There was no number specified; it was to be enclosed, if it were required —a piece of the hill —for the crofters' cows. I could not give the exact words, but that is the sense of them.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",34
"35","32061. How were you to be indemnified for the loss of a piece of the hill?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",35
"36","—On the valuation the people appointed could not agree.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",36
"37","32062. But there was no site pointed out?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",37
"38","—No.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",38
"39","32063. Did you understand it was to be a large piece for many cows, or a small piece for three or four cows?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",39
"40","—I understood it was just to be for the cows there were. I think they had rather more then than now. They were done away with at the wish of the people; at least they did not put them on.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",40
"41","32064. And the terms —the £ 3 charged—were they contemplated in the lease, or was there any specification of what the people ought to pay?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",41
"42","—No, it was just the custom which had prevailed.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",42
"43","32065. The price of the grazing has not been raised during your time?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",43
"44","—No.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",44
"45","32066. The land was taken before?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",45
"46","—Yes.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",46
"47","32067. Is it the common custom in this part of the Highlands that the grazing for a cow is £ 3?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",47
"48","—I am not aware of any in this immediate district. At Strontian I have some, but it is only for summer grazing, and it is stipulated in. the lease that the price is to be £ 2 , 10s.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",48
"49","32068. Can these cows graze out during all the winter?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",49
"50","—No, only for the summer months ; and the £ 3 is for summer and winter.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",50
"51","32069. And must the cows be taken in in winter at short intervals or for long periods?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",51
"52","—They can almost always graze out. They require some assistance, but I believe Highland cows would live out almost without anything in an ordinary season. They are on the tether, and there is",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",52
"53","plenty of heather.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",53
"54","32070. One witness said that his aggregate payments to the account of keeping a cow for the year had been £12, that would leave £ 9 for the purchase of fodder. That must have been a very uncommon case?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",54
"55","—I have no doubt but that he stated the facts of the case. He has a very good Highland cow, and he keeps it very well, and, I believe, gives it artificial food both summer and winter. The stirk is included along with the cow in that calculation, I should say —included in the grazing —indeed, I should imagine he includes the feeding he gives to the stirk, as well as that for the cow.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",55
"56","32071. When they speak of grazing a cow, does that mean that the calf remains along with the cow until it is a stirk?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",56
"57","—Until it is twelve months old.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",57
"58","32072. So that it is grazing for a cow and stirk?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",58
"59","—Yes.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",59
"60","32073. And then they sell the stirk when it is about fourteen months old?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",60
"61","—Yes; about that.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",61
"62","32074. There has been no alteration in terms for grazing?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",62
"63","—None, so far as I am concerned. ",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",63
"64","32075. Do you think the people desire to have more cows? Do you ever receive an application which you are not able to comply with?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",64
"65","—Never. I don't remember ever refusing an application. ",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",65
"66","32076. You have heard a very general expression of opinion that your farm should be reduced for the benefit of the small tenants—that a portion should be taken off and given to them for grazing sheep or cows; could your farm support a considerable diminution of that sort without being spoiled?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",66
"67","—It would depend on what part they took. Some parts of it might be spared ; but the kind of arable land which would be of most advantage to the crofters would entail a change of the present sheep stock from Cheviots to blackfaced. We could not keep Cheviots on the hills without assistance of the arable land.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",67
"68","32077. Could the diminution not take place in a discriminating manner so as to give them a small portion of arable ground and a larger portion of the high ground?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",68
"69","—It might be done ; but i t would be a disadvantage to the farm. It is a matter of money, so far as I am concerned —a question of rent. Only, one part of it is very near the dwelling house, and a resident tenant would not like very well to have the fields in front of his house taken away from him.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",69
"70","32078. Is that part of the enclosed ground near the dwelling house and offices also near the arable ground of the crofters?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",70
"71","—It adjoins the Cambusbain lands.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",71
"72","32079. Could they not get the hill grazing without taking any portion of that?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",72
"73","—Not of Arnisdale. The Cambusbain people would require to get it at Eilanrcoch as they had it before; and I don't suppose it would entail anything more than the loss of the land there. It lies more advantageously for an operation of that sort. At Arnisdale you would require to take it off the arable land ; and most farmers like a piece of arable land to grow potatoes for themselves.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",73
"74","32080. How long has your lease to run?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",74
"75","—Ten years still to run.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",75
"76","32081. You keep Cheviot stock?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",76
"77","—I have changed the outer part to blackfaced sheep.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",77
"78","32082. I suppose none of the crofters in this neighbourhood keep any sheep stock?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",78
"79","—Only a few.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",79
"80","32083. What class of cows are they keeping now?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",80
"81","—They were all crosses between shorthorn and Ay rehire at one time, but they are changed now; there are more Ayrshire's than there used to be.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",81
"82","32084. Speaking generally, what do you think are the prospects of the large store farmers in this part of the country? Are they unfavourable, owing to the fall in the prices of wool, or does the rise in the price of stock compensate you?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",82
"83","—The rise in the price of stock won't compensate us, and we are afraid that the rise in the price of stock will not continue; the great scarcity of stock in England has had a great deal to do with it.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",83
"84","32085. Supposing your farm were out of lease at this moment, would it probably be re-let at a great reduction, if re-let at all?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",84
"85","—I have no doubt of it.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",85
"86","32086. What percentage of reduction do you think would be made—20 per cent.?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",86
"87","—Not my immediate predecessor, but the one before him—Mr Stavert—paid £525, and my rent is £ 8 2s , and I think it would very likely go back to something like Mr Stavert's rent.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",87
"88","32087. Was that about 1860?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",88
"89","—1863.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",89
"90","32088. It would revert to the rent of 1863?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",90
"91","—Yes. I am subject to correction in the date, but I think it was 1863.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",91
"92","32089. With this probably considerable fall in the rental of large farm, do you think the time would be rather a favourable one for appropriating portions of the large farms to the small tenants?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",92
"93","—I have no doubt of it.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",93
"94","32090. The loss to the proprietor would not be so great as it would have been at a previous period?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",94
"95","—Not so great as it would have been some years ago.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",95
"96","32091. Do you think the people, from what you know of them, are great sufferers by the want of grazing?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",96
"97","—Well, if they would cultivate it well they would not be sufferers.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",97
"98","32092. I rather speak of the land for grazing than of that for cultivation? ",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",98
"99","—It would require to be let in club farms. In a small way, I should be afraid it would not pay. If one man had only fifty or a hundred sheep enclosed by themselves, I am afraid it would not pay. I have no doubt small farms grazed with black cattle and blackfaced sheep, as used to be, would pay better than our large farms at present.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",99
"100","32093. Do you find upon the soil of your farm many remains of ancient occupancy and cultivation?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",100
"101","—Not on Arnisdale. There are a few, but not many. There is not much arable land on Arnisdale.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",101
"102","32094. Two or three hundred acres that might be cultivated1?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",102
"103","—Not much over one hundred that could be worked at all. What is arable land in Arnisdale is very good land, but all the remainder is bleak, rocky land, not adapted for cultivation.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",103
"104","32095. Why have you not broken up more if there is this good arable land?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",104
"105","—I break it all up in rotation, except one portion which lies in—a  Cheviot hirsel, which, if I were to break it up, would necessitate a change from Cheviot to blackfaced stock, and at present would entail a loss of £1 a head in changing from Cheviot to blackfaced.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",105
"106","32096. We have heard a great deal about the deterioration of the quality of the pasture on the ground?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",106
"107","—That is a subject on which, I think, a great deal of misapprehension exists. My father had the Strontian land in 1836, and I think I am able to keep as many sheep on it as he did, and a few more; and I think they are of as good quality —at least, I get as much for them, considering my neighbours' sheep, as my father did. I don't think there is any deterioration in the hill grazings. Any deterioration that may be is where game abounds —rabbits and deer —or, what is more generally the case, where people have stocked Highland hill land with sheep which were not suited for it, and which should have been reared in parks. What are called high-class Cheviot sheep, with open skins and arched noses, are not able to live on the west coast, or on almost any hill land; but where you get them close in the coat, and with good chests, and able to protect themselves against the weather, the land will keep as many of those sheep as ever it did, excepting where it is overrun with game, or is injured for some other reason easily accounted for.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",107
"108","32097. You don't think the pasturing of sheep for any length of time deteriorates the pasture?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",108
"109","—Most decidedly not.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",109
"110","32098. We have often heard it alleged in the Highlands?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",110
"111","—I hold a good many acres of land, and all the land I have keeps as many sheep as ever I have heard of its keeping during this century, as far as I can trace it back.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",111
"112","32099. Mr Cameron.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",112
"113","—Do you not think that many portions of hill land in the Highlands is more covered with 'bog' than it used to be?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",113
"114","—No, I don't think so.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",114
"115","32100. Do you think that grass grows as abundantly and as sweet?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",115
"116","—Yes.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",116
"117","32101. Have you not heard contrary opinions expressed by any of your brother farmers?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",117
"118","—Yes, very often.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",118
"119","32102. Do you think those who think otherwise are in the majority or the reverse?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",119
"120","—I would not like to answer the question. ",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",120
"121","32103. In speaking of taking land from the big farms and giving it to the crofters, you stated that under present conditions you thought the land might profitably be turned to the purposes to which it was formerly devoted, namely, black cattle and blackfaced sheep?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",121
"122","—I have no doubt of it. ",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",122
"123","32104. What would be the requirements, in order to carry out that system, with regard to the subdivision of land, houses, or stock?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",123
"124","—There would not be so much in houses, because most of the old farmhouses are remaining; but I think the principal want would be the getting the class of tenants that formerly existed.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",124
"125","32105. But do you think that the system could be profitably adopted with the crofters as they are found in the vicinity? Do you think they would have the means to stock the farms with black cattle and blackfaced sheep?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",125
"126","—I am afraid not.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",126
"127","32106. What size of a farm do you think might be provided which would be most suitable?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",127
"128","—From 500 to 1000 sheep, and perhaps a score of cows.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",128
"129","32107. That would be a large farm, would it not?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",129
"130","—I would not consider it large.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",130
"131","32108. But taking in view the point to which your attention was directed, namely, the provision of land for the class of people called crofters, that would be a large farm, would it not?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",131
"132","—I don't think, for a district farm, 500 sheep would be very great.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",132
"133","32109. You mean that should be a club farm?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",133
"134","—Yes.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",134
"135","32110. And that each crofter should have twenty head of cattle?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",135
"136","—No; altogether, and their followers.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",136
"137","32111. But don't you think it would be better that a club farm should be confined to sheep, &c, and that each crofter should individually have his own cow?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",137
"138","—Yes, that is my meaning —to restrict every one to a certain number.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",138
"139","32112. What would each crofter have as his share of the cattle and sheep, according to your view?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",139
"140","—Perhaps four or five cows.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",140
"141","32113. And 200 sheep?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",141
"142","—Yes; from 100 to 200.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",142
"143","32114. Would not that process entail very considerable expense on the part of some one—the proprietor or the crofters themselves —in carrying it out?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",143
"144","—It would entail a certain expense at first.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",144
"145","32115. How much arable land would be required to winter these twenty cattle—the sheep would find their own wintering?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",145
"146","—The sheep would find their own wintering. They would get the advantage in winter of the arable land which was cultivated.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",146
"147","32116. How much arable land would be required?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",147
"148","—Fifty acres.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",148
"149","32117. According to your view, that would take away half the arable land of your farm?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",149
"150","—If it were done on my farm it would.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",150
"151","32118. I suppose you consider that where crofters keep sheep they should keep a ewe stock, and not a wether stock; or do you consider a wether stock might be kept?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",151
"152","—It would depend altogether on the class of land.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",152
"153","32119. But supposing there was a farm where part was under ewes and part under wethers, if the crofters took away the portion which was devoted to ewes, would it be difficult to get rid of the land which was grazed by the wethers?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",153
"154","—I don't think so. Most of the land grazed by wethers would be under blackfaced ewe stock, or mixed stock, or blackfaced stock.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",154
"155","32120. Has Arnisdale wether stock?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",155
"156","—Mostly wethers, or, at least, a good proportion of it.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",156
"157","32121. Could the crofters keep ewes on this wether land?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",157
"158","—The wether land is out of the reach of the crofters. Arnisdale is not a farm —at least, not much of it",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",158
"159","—fit for the purposes of a club farm.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",159
"160","32122. You think Arnisdale would not be suitable to make the experiment upon?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",160
"161","—Part of it would. ",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",161
"162","32123. Could the remaining part be let?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",162
"163","—There might be a difficulty in that",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",163
"164","32124. Could it not be divided in such a way  that the crofters might take part of the high ground and part of the low ground?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",164
"165","—It might be; but you would take all the shore land, and leave the high land for an outrun—for wether ground altogether.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",165
"166","32125. How many cows were grazed by the crofters on your farm when you first went there?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",166
"167","—I could, not say. I do not think there were above five or six.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",167
"168","32126. And how many are there now?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",168
"169","—I think three.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",169
"170","32127-28. Would you find any disadvantage to the farm in grazing cows to the extent, say, of one cow for each crofter marching with Arnisdale, provided you were paid for it?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",170
"171","—I would rather not have them, if I am to take a mere money view of it.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",171
"172","32129. But do you think grazing twenty cows at the rate of £ 3 a head would do your sheep farm any substantial damage? ",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",172
"173","—It would.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",173
"174","32130. Do you think you would make as much as that out of the extra sheep you might keep?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",174
"175","—I have no doubt I could ; for this reason, that it is the wintering part of it that the cows graze on.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",175
"176","32131. Do the cows not, although they eat the grass, to some extent improve pasture by manure?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",176
"177","—Cattle of any kind do —cows less than young cattle, but the mixture of cattle amongst the sheep improves the land.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",177
"178","32132. And do you think twenty cows would be too much for your farm?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",178
"179","—Oh no; if they could be properly distributed over the land.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",179
"180","32133. But don't you think you might manage to graze these twenty cows at a fair rent and not be a loser by it?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",180
"181","—I might not be a loser, but I would rather not have them. I am speaking from my own point of view entirely.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",181
"182","32134. Would you require to winter away any more young sheep in consequence?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",182
"183","—Yes.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",183
"184","32135. How many do you think you would require to winter away in consequence of the twenty cows?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",184
"185","—Perhaps 200",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",185
"186","32136. A couple of hundred ; and what do you winter them at, 7s. or 8s.?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",186
"187","—Not many of them come home at 8s. I always count them at 10s.; but young sheep are not so bad as hoggs. I might mention that this district is very much in want of telegraphic communication. Excuse my taking up the time of the delegates, but they did not seem to bring out that fact. Last year we had, perhaps, a couple of thousand fishermen here from all parts of Scotland, and there was no telegraphic communication ; and the postal communication is the worst you can conceive. It is not so bad this year; but last year letters from Arnisdale lay two nights at Glenelg before they were sent away, and they lay, I believe, another night at Strome. Now fish is a very perishable article, and yet that was the communication the people had, unless they went to Isle Ornsay. I think that is a great want in this district —the want of proper postal and telegraphic communication.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",187
"188","32137. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",188
"189","—You have been present to-day and have heard what the people have been saying?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",189
"190","—Yes.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",190
"191","32138. Do you think they have any grievances at all worth speaking about?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",191
"192","—I have no doubt they have.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",192
"193","32139. Do you think that a lot of people with only one acre of land with no cows among them worth speaking of, is a satisfactory state of matters for their comfort?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",193
"194","—Possibly it is not; it depends very much upon what they wish to be at. If they are fishermen, I think they should turn their attention as much as possible to fishing; although, of course, they require land to grow potatoes and to keep cows for milk. As a rule, the two don't go together to any extent.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",194
"195","32140. You admit that it is necessary for them to have potatoes and milk?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",195
"196","—Yes.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",196
"197","32141. Will one acre of ground such as they have enable them to have milk?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",197
"198","—No.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",198
"199","32142. And therefore to that extent they have a grievance?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",199
"200","—Yes; and I think £ 2 an acre is a very high rent.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",200
"201","32143. Do you consider it right in any proprietor to keep people on his property unless he gives them facilities in the way of potato ground and of milk, even if these are fishermen?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",201
"202","—Am I bound to answer that question?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",202
"203","32144. The Chairman.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",203
"204","—No; it is a question of general opinion. I think you may say, if you like, you are not able to answer the question, or that you don't wish to do so. At the same time, if you can do so, it will be desirable that you should, because it is a question which any gentleman of intelligence and independent opinion can answer perhaps?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",204
"205","—I don't think it right; but I would rather not enter into my views upon that.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",205
"206","32145. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",206
"207","—Do you consider it unreasonable of many people who are on this estate to complain of only having an acre of land, paying over £ 1 or £2 of rent, considering the magnitude of land belonging to the same proprietor?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",207
"208","—No, I don't.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",208
"209","32146. Lochiel put a question to you about the crofters having club farms in the manner you suggested. Supposing this club farm were started and in operation, do you think that the crofters in that club farm would be able to compete with large farmers like yourself in the quality of their stock, whether of cattle or sheep, and so far as getting good prices for them is concerned?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",209
"210","—I have no doubt they would if they paid the same attention.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",210
"211","32147. You have stated that if your place were out of lease at this moment the rent would revert to about £300 less than you are paying at present?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",211
"212","—That is my opinion.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",212
"213","32148. And evidently at that rent you are not making much of it?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",213
"214","—That is a different question.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",214
"215","32149. I am not to come to the conclusion that you are not making anything of it?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",215
"216","—No.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",216
"217","32150. As a proprietor and tenant of land, having therefore double capacity to form a correct opinion, do you not think it would be a wise thing if you had a number of people on your property who were circumscribed in their holdings, to improve their position by enlarging their holdings?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",217
"218","—Yes, I would.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",218
"219","32151. Sheriff Nicolson.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",219
"220","—Where do you think the telegraphic station ought to be erected?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",220
"221","—If we had such fishing at Arnisdale as we have had for the last two years, I should say Arnisdale is the best place. The advantage would not be alone to the immediate neighbourhood, but to all the fishermen on the west coast. If it had not been for the Loch Hourn fishing last year we would have had semi-starvation over the whole district.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",221
"222","32152. Would the telegraph be required during any other part of the year?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",222
"223","—Not except during the fishing.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",223
"224","32153. Where is the nearest telegraphic station?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",224
"225","—Isle Ornsay, and it is very rough crossing over to it. I crossed it one day last year in extremity, and I would not like to do it again under the circumstances.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",225
"226","32154. If a telegraphic station were established here at Glenelg, would it be sufficient?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",226
"227","—It would be a great advantage.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",227
"228","32155. Has any representation been made to the post-office?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",228
"229","—Not that I am aware of.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",229
"230","32156. I suppose you have no idea what the cost of it would be?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",230
"231","—None.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",231
"232","32157. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",232
"233","—You said you thought the great difficulty in establishing a club farm would be finding tenants of a suitable class?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",233
"234","—Yes.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",234
"235","32158. Of such tenants as formerly existed in the Highlands?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",235
"236","—Yes.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",236
"237","32159. I suppose you mean tenants with a capital of from £300 to £500?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",237
"238","—Yes, or £1000; of course, more capital is required now-a-days.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",238
"239","32160. The club tenants you thought of establishing are not at all of the crofter class, but capitalists more or less?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",239
"240","—Some of them would be of the present crofter class. A man must creep before he can walk, and people with comparatively little capital must go from less to more.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",240
"241","32161. You mean, if a man had £100 or £200 he would get help?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",241
"242","—Yes.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",242
"243","32162. But you think his stock should be a stock of £400 or £500 at least?",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",243
"244","—Yes. I have no doubt smaller places might be advantageously put in.",540,"James Milligan","Inverness-shire, Glenelg",244
