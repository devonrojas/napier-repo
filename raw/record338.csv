"1","ARTHUR JAMES HAY, Merchant, Lerwick, (47)—examined.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",1
"2","18158. The Chairman.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",2
"3","—You are also factor for Lord Zetland?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",3
"4","—Yes ",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",4
"5","18159. In what are you a merchant?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",5
"6","—General merchant, and fish curer.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",6
"7","18160. As a general merchant you are in constant correspondence and traffic with the fishing population?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",7
"8","—Almost continually.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",8
"9","18161. Are your transactions with the fishing population conducted entirely on the principle of truck and barter, or on that of money payments?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",9
"10","—Both; but quite voluntarily on the part of those connected with me.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",10
"11","18162. What system predominates?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",11
"12","—I think the money system is now predominating very much, except where fishermen require advances to enable them to carry on their pursuits.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",12
"13","18163. How many years have you been personally engaged in this traffic?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",13
"14","—Twenty-five years or more.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",14
"15","18164. Has the system changed since you began —did the truck system prevail more generally when you began than it does now?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",15
"16","—I do not recognise it, as the truck system, as it is understood in England —it is a necessity of the situation which the poor fishermen are placed in, that they must have the assistance of those who. employ them to carry on their occupations.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",16
"17","18165. Was the system of payment in goods or barter more general when you began your business?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",17
"18","—I think it was.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",18
"19","18166. You think it is on the decline, but are money payments taking the place of it?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",19
"20","—I think so, in a great measure.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",20
"21","18167. When you first began was there any discontent among the fishing population, produced by the practice of the truck or barter system?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",21
"22","—I think not. There were some abuses, probably shown about the time of the Truck Commission; but, as a general rule, I do not think there was anything to object to in it.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",22
"23","18168. Are you aware of any complaints at the present moment?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",23
"24","—None whatever.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",24
"25","18169. As a fish-curer, are you in the habit of supplying boats?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",25
"26","—Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",26
"27","18170. Do you do that extensively?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",27
"28","—To a large extent.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",28
"29","18171. Since you have been engaged in that branch of the trade, has there been a change in the character of the boats?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",29
"30","—Yes, they are of a larger description, and adapted to the herring fishery which has now developed to a larger extent.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",30
"31","18172. What is the size of the most improved character of the boats?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",31
"32","—Large boats, of from 43 feet to 50 feet of keel.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",32
"33","18173. Half-decked?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",33
"34","—Wholly decked now.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",34
"35","18174. And the beam?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",35
"36","—-About 14 feet, I think.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",36
"37","18175. What is the tonnage?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",37
"38","—Twenty to twenty-five tons.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",38
"39","18176. When you build or supply new boats they are of that character?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",39
"40","—-Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",40
"41","18177. And what was the character of the boats when you first remember?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",41
"42","—In the fishery they were half-decked boats, and a great many of the native boats of the country, some of which are still in existence.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",42
"43","18178. Is the superiority of the new class of boats generally recognised by the fishermen?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",43
"44","—I think, in a great measure it gives them an opportunity of making larger earnings, but at a greater risk and outlay. Were it coming an unsuccessful season, the effect and consequence to the people, as well as those engaged in the business would be very serious —much more so than under the older system.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",44
"45","18179. But they go a greater distance?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",45
"46","—Well, they have not required to do so.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",46
"47","18180. Is there no alteration in the distance, to which the herring fishery is carried during your recollection?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",47
"48","—No, it is has been remarkable during the past few years that herring fishery has been pursued close to the islands.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",48
"49","18181. And the system of going to the western coast, is the same now as when you began?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",49
"50","—Yes, the early herring fishery was carried on the west coast very many years ago, long before the present time.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",50
"51","18182. What is your system of payment? Are the boats hired by the men who sail them?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",51
"52","—No, they are usually provided to the men, and they endeavour to pay them off, as they can, out of their earnings.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",52
"53","18183. They are provided to the men —the men, in a sense, hire the boats?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",53
"54","—No, they purchase them; but they have to get credit upon them for an indefinite period.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",54
"55","18184. How many men would generally club to purchase a boat of the sizes you mention?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",55
"56","—There are generally six men in a boat, and sometimes four of them are considered shareholders—sometimes all of them. ",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",56
"57","18185. Do they endeavour every year to purchase out their share in the boat?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",57
"58","—Yes, it is understood the half of the earnings are to go in towards the price of the boat.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",58
"59","18186. Is that punctually paid or frequently in arrears?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",59
"60","—I am not aware of any departure from that in the habit.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",60
"61","18187. It is the general custom?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",61
"62","—Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",62
"63","18188. Do you know of examples in which the boat passes entirely into the possession of the men who work her?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",63
"64","—I have known it almost paid off in one or two years, but that was an extraordinarily successful fishing.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",64
"65","18189. And there are a number of the boats which we see here engaged in the fishery, which are entirely the property of the men who work them?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",65
"66","—Yes, when they are paid for. ",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",66
"67","18190. But are they so frequently paid for, that many of the boats are actually their own property?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",67
"68","—A great many of them are,",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",68
"69","18191. What is the system of payment? Do the men pay a certain proportion of the fish they catch?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",69
"70","—The half of them usually goes in upon the boat.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",70
"71","18192. How is the price of the fish ascertained? How is it struck?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",71
"72","—They fish for whom they like, unless they have made a special bargain with the outfitter who equips them.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",72
"73","18193. They are not under any contract to supply fish to the person who furnishes the boat?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",73
"74","—Sometimes it is made a condition that he shall have the preference at general prices of the country.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",74
"75","1819-1. Is that generally the course in your own trade —that you have the preference?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",75
"76","—If we advance a boat, we make a condition that we shall have a preference at the highest prices they have been able to get; they give the curer the first offer.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",76
"77","18195. They are bound to give the curer the first offer, at the highest prices prevailing in the market at the time?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",77
"78","—Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",78
"79","18196. How is that price ascertained or verified to you?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",79
"80","—It is generally discussed amongst the curers and the fishermen before anything is decided upon. It is a pretty uniform price which exists at present.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",80
"81","18197. Do you generally take the fish at the price, or are there instances of your refusing to take fish or their refusing to deal with you and dealing with other parties?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",81
"82","—There are many cases in which I refuse to take them; I could not take them all.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",82
"83","18198. When you take them do you pay always in money, or do you occasionally pay in goods?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",83
"84","—Partly in both; we are in the position of having advanced for provisions what they required, either in money or goods.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",84
"85","18199. In making your payment in goods you have reference only to what has been advanced, you do not pay prospectively in goods—you do not pay down in goods unless they have received the goods before? ",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",85
"86","—No, certainly not.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",86
"87","18200. In making these payments in goods, is that more the custom or less the custom than it was formerly?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",87
"88","—I think it is less the custom than formerly.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",88
"89","18201. Do you think the fishermen are less indebted to you for advances than they were previously, or more indebted?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",89
"90","—It depends entirely on the success of the fishing.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",90
"91","18202. Are there many of the fishermen who deal with you, who have no advances made to their families before —who are, as it were, before the world?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",91
"92","—Many of them.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",92
"93","18203. More than was previously the case?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",93
"94","—I think they are all in",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",94
"95","very fair circumstances at present and do not require them.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",95
"96","18201. On the whole, do you think that the earnings of the fishermen are greater than they were—that their condition is more prosperous than it was?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",96
"97","—While the fishing continues successful it will be so, but if a reaction takes place I expect considerable evil and misery from the increased earnings of the last few years inducing more expensive habits amongst them.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",97
"98","18205. Are the fishermen in the habit of putting any portion of their earnings in the Savings Banks?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",98
"99","—A very great amount, I believe.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",99
"100","18206. Sheriff Nicolson.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",100
"101","—You are factor for the Earl of Zetland?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",101
"102","—Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",102
"103","18207. And he is proprietor of a large portion of Shetland?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",103
"104","—No, not at all; his property in Shetland is not of any great extent. His property is more in Orkney",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",104
"105","18208. What is the rental of Lord Zetland's land?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",105
"106","—About £900, I think.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",106
"107","18209. How many tenants have you?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",107
"108","—I cannot say off hand.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",108
"109","18210. Have you a large number of the class called crofters into whose condition we have been examining?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",109
"110","—Yes, they are almost all crofters.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",110
"111","18211. Are all those crofters about whom Lord Napier has been inquiring in possession of land as crofters, or are any of them cottars?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",111
"112","—Most of them I should think are fishermen and sailors—a great many of them. There are not many holdings which enable them to maintain themselves wholly by farming.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",112
"113","18212. But do any of them live by fishing entirely?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",113
"114","—Fishing, combined with the croft.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",114
"115","18213. Are there any of them purely fishermen without land?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",115
"116","—None upon Lord Zetland's property.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",116
"117","18214. What is the extent of their crofts generally, or do they vary?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",117
"118","—They vary very much.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",118
"119","18215. What are the largest rents any of them pay, so far as you remember?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",119
"120","—As a general rule they vary from £1 to £7.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",120
"121","18216. Are there none lower than £4?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",121
"122","—Well, in exceptional cases there are.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",122
"123","18217. What stock can they keep on a croft for which they pay £7?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",123
"124","—It used to be the system to have one animal for each £1 of rent, but they exceed very much sometimes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",124
"125","18218. Do they sometimes keep more stock than they have pasture for?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",125
"126","—When they have unlimited pasture they keep more stock than they are able to provide for during the winter time.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",126
"127","18219. What number of cows can a crofter of £7 keep? ",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",127
"128","—I said about one for every £1 of rent, with the addition of a few sheep.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",128
"129","18220. How many sheep generally do they keep?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",129
"130","—There is no limit,",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",130
"131","18221. Have they all horses?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",131
"132","—They all have a few, but their numbers are small comparatively to what they were in former days.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",132
"133","18222. Do they keep horses for the purposes of breeding and selling?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",133
"134","—That is one of the means by which they pay their rent. The rearing and disposal of one pony would often pay their rent entirely.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",134
"135","18223. Has the price of Shetland ponies fallen off very much?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",135
"136","—No, it has advanced very much. They will get as much for a one-year-old pony almost as will pay the rent.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",136
"137","18224. What is the price at present?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",137
"138","—A one-year-old pony will bring from £4 to £5; two-year-old, about £9, and three-year-old, about £12. ",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",138
"139","18225. Are these crofters engaged in fishing?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",139
"140","—Not all; a great many of them are sailors. ",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",140
"141","18226. But none of them live entirely upon their land?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",141
"142","—There are a few isolated cases where they do so. Some of them stay at home to look after the sheep and make a living in that way —tradesmen and others.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",142
"143","18227. What crop do they generally raise?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",143
"144","—Almost entirely oats, and bere, and potatoes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",144
"145","18228. Do they raise no turnips?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",145
"146","—Very little. They are beginning to do so more generally now, but to a very small extent.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",146
"147","18229. Has there been any improvement within your experience in their system of agriculture?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",147
"148","—No, it is almost entirely spade culture.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",148
"149","18230. Perhaps the spade is better than ploughing?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",149
"150","—They have that impression.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",150
"151","18231. What is your idea?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",151
"152","—Their crofts are too small to maintain ploughing. In some districts there are fewer native ploughs than there were sixty years ago.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",152
"153","18232. Do they practice any rotation of crops?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",153
"154","—Not in these crofts. The system has been a very pernicious one, with the scalping of the hills, and the bringing in virgin earth to use as manure; that is one reason why the communities have been put under better regulations of late years.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",154
"155","18233. Have they a common pasture for cattle and sheep?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",155
"156","—They have, but not to the unlimited extent that obtained in former years.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",156
"157","18234. Are there any large farms on Lord Zetland's estate?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",157
"158","—None.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",158
"159","18235. What is the largest rental paid by any tacksman on his estate?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",159
"160","—There are no tacksmen in that sense of the word; I think about £15 is the highest rent.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",160
"161","18236. Has there been such a thing as eviction or depopulation in this",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",161
"162","part of the country?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",162
"163","—None whatever.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",163
"164","18237. Have the people ever made any complaint of having too little land, or too little pasture in particular?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",164
"165","—It has required a good deal of care to prevent subdivision of farms, but that has been avoided so far as possible.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",165
"166","18238. Have you any fixed regulations prohibiting the subdivision of land?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",166
"167","—It is understood there is no subdivision on Lord Zetland's property, We would rather enlarge them, if it were possible.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",167
"168","18239. And has there been actual subdivision to any injurious extent?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",168
"169","—Well, when a farm comes below £4 or £5 it is not sufficient to maintain a family upon it, and those who hold crofts are usually in much poorer circumstances than those who have.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",169
"170","18240. But have they to a large extent subdivided the land in this way—a father giving part of it to his son? ",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",170
"171","—On some properties I believe that does exist to some little extent.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",171
"172","18241. Do they build their own houses with the assistance of the landlord?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",172
"173","—No, there are usually special arrangements in every case, according to the circumstances. They are supposed to maintain their houses once they are furnished with them, but they do not always do so.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",173
"174","18242. But when a man is building a new house what assistance does he get?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",174
"175","—I say it is done by arrangement according to the circumstances of the case.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",175
"176","18243. And when he leaves the croft, if ever this happens, does he get compensation for the buildings?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",176
"177","—There never has been a case, in my experience, on Lord Zetland's estate, of men leaving the property.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",177
"178","18244. Do they pay their rent pretty regularly?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",178
"179","—Very regularly indeed, but I should explain that Lord Zetland's lands are very moderately rented, probably in comparison with others in the country. ",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",179
"180","18245. Has there been any increase of rent for any considerable time on Lord Zetland's property?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",180
"181","—Very little indeed, almost none.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",181
"182","18246. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",182
"183","—Do you think that there is rather too large a population at present on Lord Zetland's property?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",183
"184","—I think not.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",184
"185","18247. What means do you adopt to prevent the increase of population? I mean the population sitting on the soil?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",185
"186","—We do not approve of squatters.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",186
"187","18248. But how do you prevent them squatting —what becomes of the increase of the population ?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",187
"188","—I suppose they naturally emigrate to places where they can make a better living than in this country.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",188
"189","18249. Where do they emigrate to?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",189
"190","—The most of our people are seafaring men, who go to the colonies in the course of their profession, and often settle there; and there has been a great deal of voluntary emigration from Shetland of late years.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",190
"191","18250. There has been a great deal of emigration to the colonies from Lord Zetland's property?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",191
"192","—No, from Shetland generally.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",192
"193","18251. And from the Zetland property also?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",193
"194","—Yes, many young men go abroad.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",194
"195","18252. And thus the increase of population is provided for?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",195
"196","—Yes, the natural increase.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",196
"197","18253. Has there been much poverty this last year in Shetland?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",197
"198","—None at all.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",198
"199","18254. Was there no failure of the potato crop last year?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",199
"200","—No, nothing more than usual.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",200
"201","18255. These tenants of Lord Zetland's are all fishermen, and a great many of the fishermen are in debt are they not ?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",201
"202","—I am not aware of any of Lord Zetland's tenants being in debt.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",202
"203","18256. Have all Lord Zetland's tenants got boats and nets free?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",203
"204","—They are not all in the category you were asking me the previous questions about; I was speaking of the people all over.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",204
"205","18257. I presume a certain number of Lord Zetland's tenants are under advances from curers?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",205
"206","—Probably they will be.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",206
"207","18258. How do they find money to pay their rents ?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",207
"208","—Either off their crofts, or their earnings at sea.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",208
"209","18259. But their earnings are pledged to the curer?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",209
"210","—No, no pledge; it is a matter of arrangement that a portion of the earnings go to clear the price of the boat and goods.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",210
"211","18260. If necessary would the curer advance the money for the rent too?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",211
"212","—Not necessarily, I am not aware of any cases of that that have come under my notice.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",212
"213","18261. When is the fishing season here?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",213
"214","—It usually commences in March and lasts till September.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",214
"215","18262. Not the herring fishing?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",215
"216","—No, but the combined fishings.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",216
"217","18263. When are the prices of the fish fixed?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",217
"218","—Usually before they commence, in the winter season. The system has become very much assimilated to that which obtains on the Scotch coast",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",218
"219","18264. Are men engaged before hand at these fixed prices?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",219
"220","—Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",220
"221","18265. And when does the settlement take place with them?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",221
"222","—In October or November.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",222
"223","18266. Those that are in debt receive advances in goods for their necessities?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",223
"224","—Not necessarily.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",224
"225","18267. If they want advances do the curers who engage them not give them advances?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",225
"226","—If they require it, in special cases; there is no system of forced advance.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",226
"227","18268. But if a man is in debt, and has not ready money to purchase what he requires, the curer by whom he is engaged usually gives him what he requires?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",227
"228","—I think so; they accommodate him in that way very frequently. ",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",228
"229","18269. Is the price which he pays for these goods he thus gets in advance different from what he would pay if he paid ready money?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",229
"230","—I think not.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",230
"231","18270. Is it not necessary when you give credit of that sort that you should ask something more?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",231
"232","—I never heard of two prices; any one making a purchase might get discount for ready money, but the prices are the same.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",232
"233","18271. The difference is in the way that the man gets discount?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",233
"234","—If you go to take credit from any tailor in London, I suppose you have that system.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",234
"235","18272. I suppose meal is the principal means of subsistence here?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",235
"236","—It is the staple food.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",236
"237","18273. What is the price of meal?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",237
"238","—I cannot say. It is regulated by the price in Aberdeen, or wherever it is imported from. It fluctuates with the market rate. All the stores keep these goods.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",238
"239","18274. What is the price at present?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",239
"240","—I cannot say at this moment.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",240
"241","18275. Lately?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",241
"242","—It varies.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",242
"243","18276. But can you not say what it has been through the winter or in the spring?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",243
"244","—No, I am sorry to say, I have not paid that attention to it.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",244
"245","18277. Lord Zetland's tenants are not bound to deal at any particular shops?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",245
"246","—Not at all.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",246
"247","18278. It used to be the custom in some parts of Shetland for tenants to be bound to deal with certain shops?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",247
"248","—I do not look at it in that light; I think it was a necessity of the situation. The country is wide and the population sparse, and there are few places where people can get the necessities of life; and they must go where they can set them.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",248
"249","18279. It was for the convenience of the population that the proprietor erected a shop; but having erected it, was it not customary to bind the tenants to deal there?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",249
"250","—I do not know that it was compulsory; it was a result of the situation. In former days the proprietor had, in a great measure, to support his tenantry when they were in very poor circumstances.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",250
"251","18280. And you think they are less liable to be in poor circumstances than they were before?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",251
"252","—I think at present they are in fair circumstances all over the country.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",252
"253","18281. Are you not aware of any case of compulsion on the tenants to deal with a certain shop?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",253
"254","—Not one in Shetland. I do not believe there is a case of compulsion in Shetland.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",254
"255","18282. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",255
"256","—You say you have been about twentyfive years in business, you must have begun very early?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",256
"257","—Yes, I commenced business early.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",257
"258","18283. You succeeded some relative?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",258
"259","—My father had been largely engaged in business.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",259
"260","18283. How long is it since he began business?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",260
"261","—Probably about the commencement of the century.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",261
"262","18284. You are a native of this town? ",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",262
"263","—Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",263
"264","18285. In that way of course you are well acquainted with the place, and have spent all your days here?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",264
"265","—Yes, I think I am pretty familiar with all the circumstances of the place.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",265
"266","18286 With regard to Lord Zetland's own property, you have said that the rents have not been altered for a great number of years, and there are no arrears just now?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",266
"267","—Very slight, —in the case of a few widows, perhaps.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",267
"268","18287. You said that the rents of the smaller tenants ranged from £4  to £7, take a medium say of £5 of rent, can you give us any idea of the extent of arable land which a man paying £5 would have?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",268
"269","—Almost every different farm varies, because there is so much grass and so much arable; I cannot answer that question.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",269
"270","18288. Can you not say approximately how much arable land a man paying £5 of rent would have ?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",270
"271","—No.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",271
"272","18289. Would he have five acres?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",272
"273","—No, I do not think he would have five acres. He would have five acres including grass land.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",273
"274","18290. No more than five acres including pasture?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",274
"275","—The pasture is different.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",275
"276","18291. But within his own exclusive enclosure, would he not have more than five acres of all classes of ground, including grass land?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",276
"277","—He would.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",277
"278","18292. You stated that Lord Zetland's rents were exceptionally low in regard to other properties, can you give us an approximate idea of what rents are paid per acre?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",278
"279","—No, I could not say; I did not come prepared to do so.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",279
"280","18293. Are you aware that in some cases, the rents are considered very high in Shetland?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",280
"281","—I have never heard any complaint of such a thing.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",281
"282","18294. If there were such complaints you must have heard them?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",282
"283","—I do not think there are any cases of rack renting in Shetland, that is a matter which cures itself very quickly, if the rents were too high, people cannot pay them and leave. They are bad payers if the rents are too high. It is one of the mistakes made, for in putting too high rents on the crofts, the landlord suffers.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",283
"284","18295. Is there any competition for these small places?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",284
"285","—No, not very great; there is no great demand at this moment by crofters for more farms.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",285
"286","18296. When you mentioned that there were no ploughs, so that ploughs were getting fewer than formerly, you spoke about the soil being turned by the spade; did you mean the common spade?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",286
"287","—The native spade is used.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",287
"288","18297. Is it a long-headed spade?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",288
"289","—It is not a heavy spade; it is one of very old date, one used with the foot.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",289
"290","18298. Are there any complaints, generally speaking, in this island, on the part of small holders, on account of the rents, or that they are overcrowded?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",290
"291","—No, I have heard nothing of the kind for many years; there has been no dissatisfaction expressed. There may be dissatisfied individuals, but there is no dissatisfaction whatever in the country.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",291
"292","18299. Is the population of Shetland increasing or decreasing?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",292
"293","—It is about stationary, I think, in consequence of the emigration, and the ordinary outlets.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",293
"294","18300. Are there any large farms or tacks on the Islands?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",294
"295","—Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",295
"296","18301. Mention one or two of the larger ones and their names?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",296
"297","—I am not sure of the largest, but there are a few in this neighbourhood.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",297
"298","18302. Just take this neighbourhood?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",298
"299","—The largest here is Binnsgarth, which belongs to my brother.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",299

"303","—I think about £350.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",303
"304","18305. What sort of a farm is it?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",304
"305","—Combined agricultural and sheep farm.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",305
"306","18306. Has your brother been in possession of it for sometime?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",306
"307","—Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",307
"308","18307. Is it principally an agricultural farm?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",308
"309","—It is chiefly a sheep farm combined with agricultural.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",309
"310","18308. What becomes of the younger members of the family of a crofter paying £5 of rent?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",310
"311","—I think a great many of them find their way elsewhere.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",311
"312","18309. Supposing a man has five or six children, the eldest will probably succeed to the croft, what will become of the other four?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",312
"313","—If they are sailors, they go out into the world and probably settle elsewhere. In the case of daughters, they become servant girls and go elsewhere, and sometimes do not return.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",313
"314","18310. Are you aware that, on the part of these younger members of the family, there is any clinging to their native homes, if they can get an opportunity of settling?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",314
"315","—I think not. I think they rather like to go elsewhere.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",315
"316","18311. You think the seafaring life has a tendency to detach them?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",316
"317","—Yes, I do uot think they have that earth hunger we heard talk of in the Western Islands.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",317
"318","18312. What about the assessments?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",318
"319","—The poor rate and school rate are those principally complained of. In large districts, with a small.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",319
"320","rental, the school rate particularly presses heavily upon the people.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",320
"321","18313. What is the highest rate you can recall to your recollection?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",321
"322","—Between 4s. and 5s. in the pound, one-half of which is paid by the tenant; that is for school rate alone.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",322
"323","18314. And what is the poor rate?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",323
"324","—It is also very heavy in some districts.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",324
"325","18315. Is that to some extent in consequence of the number of widows?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",325
"326","—No, I think it is very much in consequence of mismanagement, and the want of a poorhouse.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",326
"327","18316. You have no combination poorhouse to apply the test?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",327
"328","—No.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",328
"329","18317. And therefore you are compelled, to a great degree, to give relief?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",329
"330","—Yes. One fertile cause of the high rate is when people leave this country and get into bad health and poor circumstances, and we have no place to bring them back to, and we must submit to pay the same allowance as is given in larger places. The number of lunatics in some of the poorer districts also causes very heavy burdens.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",330
"331","18318. Where are your lunatics sent to?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",331
"332","—Most frequently to Montrose or Morningside.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",332
"333","18319. Are there any large proprietors in Shetland?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",333

"337","18321. Within a circuit of five and six miles?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",337

"339","18322. What is the extent of that island?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",339

"341","18323. Is there not a Lady Nicolson who is a large proprietrix?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",341
"342","—She is not a very large proprietrix in this neighbourhood, but she is in different parishes. I think the chief property she has is in the island of Fetlar. She has two-thirds of the island of Fetlar.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",342
"343","18324. Are there a good number of small owners of land scattered over Shetland?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",343
"344","—Yes, a great many.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",344
"345","18325. Have you proprietors, not feuars, of from £20 to £50 value?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",345
"346","—There are a great many of them.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",346
"347","18326. What are the circumstances of these people? Do they labour their own land?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",347
"348","—Yes, they cultivate their own land.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",348
"349","18327. Are these in fairly good circumstances?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",349
"350","—There are few proprietors having property worth £5 or £6 who farm their own land.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",350
"351","18328. Do the bigger ones—up to £50—do the same?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",351
"352","—There are not many of that class. A man, as a little investment, may have that amount of land, and may let it to some one else.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",352
"353","18329. Can land be purchased in small quantities in country parts?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",353
"354","—When it comes into the market there is sometimes considerable competition for it.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",354
"355","18330. Suppose any one wanted land, could he get a small quantity?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",355
"356","—-It would depend very much if there was any one wanting to sell.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",356
"357","18331. Is there such land in the market?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",357
"358","—There is very little at present. Sometimes you see occasional advertisements of land for sale, but I am not aware of any just now.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",358
"359","18332. In fact, the land is not changing hands much?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",359
"360","—No.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",360
"361","18333. Although the Earl of Zetland has not increased his rent, has the value of land risen?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",361
"362","—It is pretty stationary. There was some increase a few years ago; but it has been in about a normal state for a long time.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",362
"363","18334. Is there any improvement going on in the way of developing roads or making new roads?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",363
"364","—Each year there is always an increase in the extent of the roads, but it is done under the Road Act.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",364
"365","18335. Is the assessment for roads heavy?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",365

"367","18336. Is the town of Lerwick improving in value and rising in importance?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",367
"368","—It has increased, to some extent, of late years. There is a great deal more building going on in consequence principally of the fisheries.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",368
"369","18337. Can anybody who wants to build a house get a site for it?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",369
"370","—There is no difficulty hers. There is what is called the town property, and it can be feued by any one wanting it.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",370
"371","18338. The town has got land outside the burgh boundaries?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",371
"372","—Within the burgh boundaries.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",372
"373","18339. Is it given off by a system of feuing or of sale?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",373
"374","—Feuing.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",374
"375","18340. What is asked per acre for land close to the town?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",375
"376","—It is given off by the foot.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",376
"377","18341. How much, in a good place, is charged per foot of frontage?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",377
"378","—I think it is limited to 6d. a foot in one line of street and 3d. in another, with a bonus of £5 .",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",378
"379","18342. Is the town hall we see here entirely erected at the expense of the corporation?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",379
"380","—No; it has been erected by a Limited Liability Company.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",380
"381","18313. Mr Cameron.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",381
"382","—You say the price of ponies has increased of late years; to what circumstances is that owing?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",382
"383","—To the diminished numbers, I think, as well as the demand for them for coal mines.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",383
"384","18344. And not in any way on account of improved breed?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",384
"385","—It has been attempted, but it lessens the value. Their value consists in their small size. If they exceed a certain size they are not suitable for coalmines, and the cause of the increase in price is owing to the demand for the coal mines.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",385
"386","18345. Are there any large breeders in the island?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",386
"387","—The Marquis of Londonderry is the only large breeder. He has a farm for raising ponies for the purposes of his own coal mines. The farm is on the island of Noss and partly on the island of Bressay.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",387
"388","18346. Where is Noss?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",388
"389","—Beyond Bressay.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",389
"390","18347. Is the knitting industry a source of revenue to the people?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",390
"391","—It is the chief occupation of the female population.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",391
"392","18348. Can they make a good deal by it?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",392
"393","—Oh, yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",393
"394","18349. Do they find a better demand for goods now than formerly ?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",394
"395","—I believe Shetland hosiery has always stood very well in the market.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",395
"396","18350. They get better prices now than formerly?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",396
"397","—I think so.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",397
"398","18351. Has there been any alteration iu the breed of sheep of late years?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",398
"399","—The larger farmers have introduced cross-breds and Cheviots and Leicesters, but the crofters can only have the native breed.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",399
"400","18352. Are the woollen goods made from the same class of wool as formerly ?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",400
"401","—So far as it can be got, but there is a good deal of imported wool used.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",401
"402","18353. Have the woollen goods not deteriorated in quality in consequence of the change of the breed of sheep? Is the native breed of sheep becoming rare?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",402
"403","—I think it is; I do not think there are so many as there used to be; the people pay no attention to the breeding of them.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",403
"404","18354. Has the system tended to decrease the quantity of the native goods that go to the market, or to make the quality inferior ?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",404
"405","—I do not think you would get the same quality of real pure Shetland wool now that you could have got many years ago. It is often bought up and taken away from the country.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",405
"406","18355. The old breed of sheep produce a particular wool which forms the far-famed Shetland goods?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",406
"407","—Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",407
"408","18356. And it has rather diminished in quantity?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",408
"409","—Yes; I think there is not the same attention paid to keep up the breed.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",409
"410","18357. But the crofters still adhere to the old breed themselves, and do not introduce the new kinds?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",410
"411","—No, except in very few instances.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",411
"412","18358. I suppose the climate would hardly suit, and opportunities of wintering are not good?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",412
"413","—If they did not provide winter food, they could not keep them.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",413
"414","18359. You did not expect to be examined when you came here, I suppose?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",414
"415","—No, I merely came forward in deference to the request of the Commission.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",415
"416","18360. If you had been prepared you would have been ready to answer some questions which you have not been able to do?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",416
"417","—Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",417
"418","18361. The Chairman.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",418
"419","—Being factor not only for Lord Zetland, but for other proprietors, do you find there is a great difference in the scale of rental paid to different proprietors by the small tenants?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",419
"420","—I should say that our desire has been always on Lord Zetland's property not to press upon people, but to keep the rents moderate and have them well paid. There has not been the striving to raise the rent which an individual. might have done on his own property.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",420
"421","18362. But have the rents been considerably raised of late years on any properties ?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",421
"422","—No, I think not; not considerably, in comparison or in proportion with the advance in the price of goods.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",422
"423","18363. There has been no raising of rents beyond a justifiable proportion, considering the advance in the price of stock?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",423
"424","—No, it has not been commensurate even with advance.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",424
"425","18364. Are there any crofters or small occupiers living upon the large farms, and paying rent to the farmers?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",425
"426","—A few labourers, perhaps, for the purposes of the farm.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",426
"427","18365. I don't mean farm servants, but labourers having employment on the farm?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",427
"428","—There will be in some cases.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",428
"429","18366. Do they pay a much higher scale of rental to the farmer than the same people would do to the proprietor?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",429
"430","—No, they perhaps pay nothing. They get a house, and may give their labour.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",430
"431","18367. Are their wages paid in money?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",431
"432","—In money always.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",432
"433","18368. There is no complaint in the country of the obligation to render service in labour or in kind?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",433
"434","—None whatever.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",434
"435","18369. Is there any complaint of small holdings and alleged exhaustion of the soil by frequent croppings. ",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",435
"436","—There is no complaint, but there is no doubt the soil does not produce as it ought to do if it were cultivated properly.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",436
"437","18370. Does it produce what it did in former times, or is there an impression that the crop is smaller now than formerly ?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",437
"438","—In cases where they are prohibited from taking the native soil off the hills, and they are not able to give it manure, it cannot produce the crops it did.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",438
"439","18371. When they take native soil off the hills, do they take it off common pasture belonging to the croft?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",439
"440","—The pastures are almost all now subdivided, and each proprietor knows his own. They are not quite",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",440
"441","common; the scatholds of the whole district are subdivided.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",441
"442","18372. But several crofters or small occupiers have had their stock in common upon the hill?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",442
"443","—Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",443
"444","18373. When they carry away soil for the improvement of arable land, do they take it off their own pasture or anywhere ?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",444
"445","—Anywhere.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",445
"446","18374. Is there generally abundance of fuel?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",446
"447","—With a few exceptions. There are a few districts where it is rather difficult to get fuel, but almost every farm has abundance.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",447
"448","18375. There is no complaint about it?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",448
"449","—No.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",449
"450","18376. Or on account of payment?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",450
"451","—There is no payment for fuel.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",451
"452","18377. Is sea-weed used as manure?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",452
"453","—Where it is convenient.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",453
"454","18378. Is any payment made for it?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",454
"455","—None at all.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",455
"456","18379. You mentioned that a great proportion of the commodities advanced to the fishermen and purchased by them consists of meal.-what meal ? Do they buy wheat flour now, or use oatmeal principally?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",456
"457","—Oatmeal. chiefly; but there is a great deal of wheaten flour used.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",457
"458","18380. Is the use of wheat flour increasing?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",458
"459","—It is, not to the advantage of the people, I think.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",459
"460","18381. Is the use of baker's bread increasing?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",460
"461","—Very greatly, I think.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",461
"462","18382. How is that procured —are there bakers established throughout the country, or do they bring it from the towns?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",462
"463","—There is a great deal sent from the town; but in two or three districts there have been bakeries",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",463
"464","opened of late years.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",464
"465","18383. Would one probably find a loaf in a small occupier's cottage?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",465
"466","—I think so.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",466
"467","18384. A baked loaf?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",467
"468","—Yes, I think so.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",468
"469","18385. When they use the flour at home, do they take it in the form of bread or scones?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",469
"470","—Scones.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",470
"471","18386. Is there any complaint of want of milk in the country?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",471
"472","—No, I think not. In the town, possibly, in a crowded season there may be, but never in the country.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",472
"473","18387. They seem to be purchasing a greater proportion of their food of a superior description, though you say it would be better if they took oatmeal?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",473
"474","—I think so.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",474
"475","18388. Do they make many of their clothes at home?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",475
"476","—In two or three districts they still make a good deal of the native cloth, but it is not general now.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",476
"477","18389. When they make the native cloth do they make it of the wool of the native sheep, or do they purchase the wool from farmers?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",477
"478","—Native wool.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",478
"479","18390. That is still made to a considerable extent?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",479
"480","—In two or three districts.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",480
"481","18391. Are these native manufactures more substantial and lasting",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",481
"482","than the clothing they buy in shops?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",482
"483","—I think so; more durable.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",483
"484","18392. What are the districts in which the native looms are still preserved?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",484
"485","—The parishes of North Mavine, Delting, and Aithsting, and there may be more. Wherever there is any number of sheep, the crofter will make use of the wool in making it into cloth.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",485
"486","18393. When you say that the finest woollen fabrics were made of the wool of the native sheep, but that now more wool is imported and purchased for the parties, what quality of wool is it that is purchased—is it Australian or Cape wool?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",486
"487","—I am sorry I cannot tell you.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",487
"488","18394. Do you think there is any deterioration in the fineness of the native fabrics?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",488
"489","—No, when you get the pure Shetland wool.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",489
"490","18395. Is there any demand for Shetland sheep out of the island?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",490
"491","—No. ",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",491
"492","18396. Are the native sheep consumed in the island?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",492
"493","—Yes, there is a great sale for them here in town. They are brought here and offered in the James Arthur market, and bring high prices, taking into ace unit the size and weight. ",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",493
"494","18397. On account of the quality of the mutton?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",494
"495","—Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",495
"496","18398. But still there is no exportation?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",496
"497","—No, not of sheep.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",497
"498","18399. Are sheeps ever killed and eaten by the small occupiers themselves?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",498
"499","—I think so, in the winter season.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",499
"500","18400. Is there any beef salted by the people for their own consumption?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",500
"501","—Where they can afford it, they often join together and purchase or kill a cow at November time.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",501
"502","19401. You stated that the houses of the small occupiers were built by the co-operation of the landlord and tenant?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",502
"503","—Well, that is a common custom. Very often the landlord has to furnish the house entirely at considerable cost, and when he does so it often brings the rental of the place beyond what the tenant can take out of the soil.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",503
"504","18402. Suppose a small holding in which the old house has become intolerably bad, and a new house has to be constructed, what sort of a house would now be constructed say on Lord Zetland's estate?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",504
"505","—A stone and lime house.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",505
"506","18403. How many rooms would it contain?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",506
"507","—Two rooms, with two large closets, perhaps.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",507
"508","18404. Any accommodation upstairs?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",508
"509","—Some of them put in a slight attic.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",509
"510","18405. And what is the roof—slated?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",510
"511","—A great many of them are wishing to have the felt roofs, but we don't approve of them. The turf roof is considered preferable—a thatch roof.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",511
"512","18406. Then a new house would still have a thatch roof?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",512
"513","—Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",513
"514","18407. Thatched with straw or grass?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",514
"515","—Straw.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",515
"516","18408. Oat straw?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",516
"517","—Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",517
"518","18409. Then there are no slated houses being built?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",518
"519","—Very rarely. They come to be rather too expensive for the holdings.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",519
"520","18410. In these improved houses would the floors be wooden or paved or earthen?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",520
"521","—Wood in one end and earth in the other.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",521
"522","18411. Would there be two chimneys in the house, or would the fire be lighted on the floor?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",522
"523","—Generally there are chimneys now in both ends.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",523
"524","18412. Then is the house for cattle attached to the new cottage or is it separate?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",524
"525","—Very often attached.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",525
"526","18413. But you enter the new house by an independent door?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",526
"527","—Yes.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",527
"528","18414. Suppose the proprietor were obliged to furnish the whole of the new house, about what money value would it be?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",528
"529","—Not less than from £40 to £50.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",529
"530","18415. In the case of an occupier carrying materials to the ground—stores and so on?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",530
"531","—Yes, by arrangement it might be so.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",531
"532","18416. But when the proprietor expends £40 or £50 in building a new house or a small holding, what rate of interest does the occupier pay?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",532
"533","—He in very often asked to pay 5 per cent., but that sometimes comes to more than he can pay in addition to the previous rent. The landlord has often to furnish such houses, and get no return.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",533
"534","18417. Are a great number of the primitive houses still in existence in the country?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",534
"535","—Yes, a great many of them; and just from that cause, that the holding cannot bear the outlay necessary to put up an improved house.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",535
"536","18418. Is there any improvement on the type of the old houses?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",536
"537","—I think so; the people are improving very much themselves.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",537
"538","18419. How were they built originally —entirely by the occupier?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",538
"539","—The old system was, I believe, that the landlord contributed a certain part—the roof or portions of the building.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",539
"540","18420. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",540
"541","—You spoke about some people being proprietors themselves of land of the value of £5, what kind of house would these proprietors have ?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",541
"542","—No better than the crofters.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",542
"543","18421 The Chairman,",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",543
"544","—Are there any examples of small occupiers purchasing the fee simple of the holding of the house?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",544
"545","—I am not aware of any.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",545
"546","18422. They will probably have little opportunity of doing so?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",546
"547","—I have heard of no case of that.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",547
"548","18423. Are the fishermen ever proprietors of t own houses?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",548
"549","—No, unless they have had a little bit of property of their own.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",549
"550","18421. Round the coast, are the fishermen ever proprietors of their houses?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",550
"551","—No.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",551
"552","18425. Is there any desire to become proprietors—possessors of real property—amongst the people?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",552
"553","—I havs not heard of anything of that kind obtaining here. By agitation it may be created, but there is nothing of that sort just now.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",553
"554","18426. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",554
"555","—Is it because it is so hopeless?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",555
"556","—No, I have never heard of it.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",556
"557","18427. What class of the people are building in the neighbourhood of the town—merchants who have made money in Lerwick?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",557
"558","—People in Lerwick. The population of the town is increasing so much it is necessary for them to build houses. A good many of the people —fishermen and others—find they cannot combine fishing and the crofting system together, and come into town and require accommodation.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",558
"559","18428. They build their own houses?",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",559
"560","—When their means afford it. There is a difficulty in getting rooms to rent in the town.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",560
"561","18429. The Chairman.",338,"Arthur James Hay","Shetland, Lerwick",561
