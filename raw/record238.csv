"1","KENNETH MACDONALD, Farmer, Scarista-vore (70)—examined.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",1
"2","13323. The Chairman.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",2
"3","—You have a farm in South Harris?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",3
"4","—Yes ",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",4
"5","13324. Have you been long resident in the country?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",5
"6","—I came to Harris about fifty-one years ago.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",6
"7","12325. Does your family belong to this country, or to another part of Scotland ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",7
"8","—I don't belong to this part of the country. I am a Rossshireman.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",8
"9","13326. Since you have been here, what do you think of the progress of the country and its people ? Do you think they are getting worse or getting better ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",9
"10","—So far as I can say conscientiously, they are getting better physically, morally, and in every sense of the word. They are better clad, and they are better fed than they were when I remember them first.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",10
"11","13327. Do you agree with those who state that there has been a great deterioration of the soil by overcropping ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",11
"12","—Decidedly. I agree with that another cause of the deterioration of the soil is this. In my first recollection of Harris, I remember in the winter time the first thing a man did was to go and clear the snow from the doors, and we had a great deal of frost. There is nothing of that now. The frost congested the soil so that nothing of the sap was lost, but we have perpetual rains now, which drive away the sap. I believe that has as much to do with the deterioration of the land as overcropping. Overcropping we know will exhaust the soil.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",12
"13","13328. Then you think the climate has altered, and altered for the worse?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",13
"14","—For the worse, because we very seldom see snow, and frost we have no continuance of, which was not in my first recollection.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",14
"15","13329. If, in your recollection, the land has been more subdivided and more exhausted, how do you account for the fact that the people are better fed and better dressed? Do they earn more wages?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",15
"16","—A great deal. I believe that £200 of money comes to Harris now for every pound that came in my first recollection. There wa3 no such thing as herring fishing. There was in some places cod and ling fishing. There was no such thing as lobster fishing. I happen to be an agent of the first company that started for sending the lobsters to London. Then an enormous amount of money is brought in now for clothes by the Countess of Dunmore. I remember one year paying an account of her ladyship, £1235 for webs of cloth alone. They still go on manufacturing.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",16
"17","13330. Is it manufactured in hand-looms?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",17
"18","—Yes.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",18
"19","13331. What material do they use?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",19
"20","—Entirely wool grown in the island.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",20
"21","13332. And the dyes?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",21
"22","—And the dyes.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",22
"23","13333. Is there any of the wool of the primitive race of sheep—the old Highland sheep, or is it blackfaced and Cheviot ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",23
"24","—It is blackfaced and Cheviot. The old primitive sheep are done.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",24
"25","13334. Can we see a specimen?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",25
"26","—Yes, if you go to St Kilda.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",26
"27","13335. Sheriff Nicolson.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",27
"28","—I think we saw them in South Uist?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",28
"29","—Yes, but you will not see them in Harris.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",29
"30","13336. The Chairman.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",30
"31","—Was the wool of fine quality?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",31
"32","—I cannot answer that, for I have never seen any.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",32
"33","13337. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",33
"34","—How much rent do you pay yourself?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",34
"35","—£145.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",35
"36","13338. You spoke about the winters now not being so severe—that is to say that frost and snow are comparatively unknown. Are high winds now more prevalent than they used to be?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",36
"37","—Decidedly. When there is very keen frost there is scarcely any wind at all; but now, since we have no frost and constant rains, we have blustering winds continually, principally from the S.S.W. and W.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",37
"38","13339. Most of the delegates who appeared before us said that the old times were better, but have you given an answer to his Lordship in the chair upon very careful consideration and observation ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",38
"39","—Yes, very.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",39
"40","13340. You are in constant communication with the people?—Yes. I remember seeing them going to church, and the difference between the clothing and attire of the families going to church then was as different as day is from night.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",40
"41","13341. Is it better in reality?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",41
"42","—Better in reality.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",42
"43","13342. But one man, a country tailor, and should know better than others, at Dunvegan, called all the fine clothing the women wear "" south country rags,"" as distinguished from their fine home-spun cloth. Do you agree with the tailor?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",43
"44","—I should not agree with that, for they are proverbial in Harris for their good spinning, their good weaving, and their good making of clothes for themselves, not only over Great Britain, but over the whole Continent. You hear of Harris tweeds here, there, and everywhere. My coat was grown on the farm, woven on the farm, and made on the farm.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",44
"45","13343. But many of the people state here that for want of sheep, and being overcrowded, they are not able to spin, and they would like to go back to the old times?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",45
"46","—Well, so far as South Harris is concerned, of the number of sheep I can say nothing. Of North Harris I can give every sheep every man has.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",46
"47","13344. We have been told, and I believe, and it is pretty generally supposed, that the temper of the people is much sobered in amusements and otherwise, and that they are not so jovial, and there is not so much amusement in the way of singing'and dancing as there was in their younger days. Is that so or not ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",47
"48","—Possibly so. They are very sober and most respectable people. I don't believe you could find in any other part of Scotland people more sober.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",48
"49","13345. Sheriff Nicolson.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",49
"50","—But do you use the word sober in the sense of being quiet, or as regards temperance—as to their being very steady ? ",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",50
"51","—They are very steady.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",51
"52","13346. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",52
"53","—Have you any poets or bards among you ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",53
"54","—Yes, there was one celebrated poet, but he died about two years ago. The Harris bard, he was always called. ",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",54
"55","13347. What was his name?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",55
"56","—Neil Mackinnon.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",56
"57","13348. Where did he stay?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",57
"58","—Luscantire.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",58
"59","13349. I wish to put a question or two in regard to the proprietors of this estate, so far as you know, from the time it left the M'Leods. Who was the first proprietor from the main branch?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",59
"60","—Captain M'Leod, son of Sir Norman M'Leod.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",60
"61","13350. Was he a purchaser ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",61
"62","—He was the first purchaser. He was the first purchaser from M'Leod of M'Leod.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",62
"63","13351. How many generations of these M'Leods were'there?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",63
"64","—There were three. Captain M'Leod's son was Mr Hugh M'Leod, but he took his mother's name of Hume, and his son Alexander was the last proprietor of Harris, who sold it to the present Lord Dunmore's grandfather.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",64
"65","13352. How far back was that?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",65
"66","—Lord Duumore bought it forty-nineyears ago. ",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",66
"67","13353. What was the price? Do you know the price?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",67
"68","—£60,000 for the estate, and £500 for the purchase of the patronage = £60,500. Tradition said that £15,000 was the price originally paid for it to M'Leod of M'Leod.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",68
"69","13354. We have been told there is a small portion of Harris—the lands of Ensay and Pabbay—belonging to Mr Stewart. When were they sold ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",69
"70","—By the present Lord Dunmore, not very many years ago.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",70
"71","13355. And he also sold North Harris ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",71
"72","—Yes.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",72
"73","13356. It was the present Lord Dunmore who sold the whole?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",73
"74","—Yes.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",74
"75","13357. To Sir Edward Scott?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",75
"76","—Yes.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",76
"77","13358. The Chairman.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",77
"78","—Are you able to tell us about Bernera in old times ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",78
"79","—Sir Norman was the whole tacksman. He had not it as property at all. He was a tacksman under M'Leod.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",79
"80","13359. And did he live at the tacksman's end or at the crofters' end?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",80
"81","—He lived in the end which the crofters have now—much about the middle of the island.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",81
"82","13360. Are there any remains of his old house ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",82
"83","—The walls. He lived in a thatched house.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",83
"84","13361. Do you think he had a large population of crofters and cottars in those days ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",84
"85","—I am sure he had not. He just had the servants—all those about him who could work a farm.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",85
"86","13362. Sheriff Nicolson.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",86
"87","—Where there some evictions which you remember, from the place where you are now living ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",87
"88","—Yes.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",88
"89","13363. When was that?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",89
"90","—I can hardly condescend upon the date. It is over forty years ago, I believe.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",90
"91","13364. Were there not very severe measures resorted to for removing the people ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",91
"92","—Decidedly—very severe.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",92
"93","13365. Was not the Black Watch actually called upon to take part in that unpleasant work?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",93
"94","—No, it was not the Black Watch, it was the 78th.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",94
"95","13366. Where did they come from?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",95
"96","—They were brought all the way from Fort George.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",96
"97","13367. And where were the people transported to?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",97
"98","—I cannot tell, but I believe they were scattered and transplanted here and there in the country.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",98
"99","13368. You don't think they were carried to the colonies?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",99
"100","—Oh, no.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",100
"101","13369. The Chairman.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",101
"102","—They may have emigrated?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",102
"103","—I cannot remember. I believe a few of them did emigrate, but I cannot say how many",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",103
"104","13370. Have you ever seen any correspondence between emigrants to America from this island and their relatives in this country ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",104
"105","—I have.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",105
"106","13371. Was it of a satisfactory kind ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",106
"107","—Most satisfactory. I knew one man who left North Harris. He was not driven away. He was a very iudustrious man, and in consequence of his industry he now drives to church in his carriage in Australia. His name is Allan M'Leod. There are various others I know of who went to America, and I had letters from them.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",107
"108","13372. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",108
"109","—Were they voluntary emigrants ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",109
"110","—Voluntary emigrants. There was one man, John Campbell, a shoemaker and cottar, who went to America with some others, and most satisfactory accounts were received from him, expressing the comfort he is enjoying. He is in Canada.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",110
"111","13373. Are you aware there is a great disinclination to emigrate?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",111
"112","—I am.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",112
"113","13374. Does it exist here?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",113
"114","—Yes, I know it for a fact, because I have been making inquiries and making overtures to parties, if they choose to go, to give them every advantage and assistance, and not only assistance to take them there, but assistance to see them comfortably planted there.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",114
"115","13375. To what do you attribute this disinclination ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",115
"116","-My idea is that it is the want of education, and that as education progresses the disinclination will disappear. Such is my idea.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",116
"117","13376. Had you ever to do with this estate at any time?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",117
"118","—I had.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",118
"119","13377. Were you factor?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",119
"120","—For a short time.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",120
"121","13378. Who stays at Rodel now ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",121
"122","—I believe the house is being prepared for his Lordship.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",122
"123","13379. There is no resident tenant now?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",123
"124","—No.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",124
"125","13380. Sheriff Nicolson.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",125
"126","—Have you had any visit in the island of Harris from gentlemen who have visited some of the other islands endeavouring to enlighten the people as to their rights, and to stir them up to do something to better their position?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",126
"127","—If you are kind enough to let me know the gentlemen you refer to, I shall answer the question, but not till then.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",127
"128","13381. I am not going to name them, because there are some we are not entirely acquainted with, but there have been persons who have visited the island of Skye, and other islands, to stir up the people?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",128
"129","—They dare not show their faces in Harris. I was told there was a very celebrated man speechifying on the pier at Tarbert, about ten days ago, the editor",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",129
"130","of the Highlander, and that is the only man who I ever heard came to Harris at all.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",130
"131","13382. Did he not get a good reception?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",131
"132","—I cannot tell, because I was thirteen and a half miles away.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",132
"133","13383. So that any expression we have heard to-day of grievances that the people here or in the adjacent islands are suffering from, is entirely spontaneous, and has not been stirred up in their minds by persons outside ?",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",133
"134","—I don't believe it was. I think it was entirely spontaneous.",238,"Kenneth Macdonald","Harris, Obe",134
