"2","(See Appendix A, LIV.)",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",2
"3","22723. The Chairman.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",3
"4","—Do you pay rent to the landlord or the farmer? ",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",4
"5","—The farmer. ",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",5
"6","22724. To whom was the written statement entrusted?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",6
"7","—To both of us, and we did not write it out to be delivered to the Commissioners, but only as a  memorandum of the grievances, and I shall read it, or you may read it:",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",7
"8","—We are delegates from the district of Rothiesholm, Stronsay, to represent the state of the cottars in that district, whose farms are sublet to them by the tenant of the main farm Rothiesholm. First, we wish to make known, that the farms we occupy have been cultivated by us, and our ancestors, except two; from ground not arable, most of it hill in its natural state, which for the first three years could not pay for its cultivation by its produce : and some part of what we had cultivated has been taken and put into the main farm, and hill given in exchange, but no payment for cultivating the ground taken from us or rent diminished, because we got hill in exchange. At present our farms differ in size between five and eleven acres or thereby, of what we call arable, and from six to twelve or thereby of hill. Putting them all collectively, we pay about 11s. per acre. Our houses we have to build at our own expense, and if taken from us we have no compensation, so this gives us little encouragement for improvement. The next we would make known is that which is felt to be slavery in the district. Most of us during winter and spring, however necessary our work at home, or if we should have an opportunity of earning five or teu shillings elsewhere, must go when called to work on the main farm for 2s. for ten hours of ordinary work, and 2s. 6d., for draining. Also we have to make one ton of kelp, and as much more as we can, and sell it to the tenant of the main farm for £ 2 , 5s. per ton, or  whatever price kelp is in the markets. During summer and autumn, except about five weeks in harvest, we feed and lodge a woman to work on the main farm. Her wages is Is. for ten hours work. During the weeks referred to in harvest we have to send a man along with the woman to work on the main farm; both have their cost for each day they work, and whether their work should be five weeks or more, the man's wages is £ 2 , 10s. and the woman's £ 1 , 10s. Also, we require a cook to prepare and carry their food to the harvest fields; her we have to feed and pay. Our desire is that in the future we may be free from bondage, and have the ground we have cultivated let to us by a proprietor and not sublet by a tenant.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",8
"9","22725. Sheriff Nicolson.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",9
"10","—How many families are there on the island?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",10
"11","—There are eleveu families in that case, but we have two more though we have not their signatures. We only represent one district, but there is another report from another district lent, it is not the same as ours, for which reason we could not put it collectively.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",11
"12","22726. Are the eleven families all in the same condition as that you have described?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",12
"13","—Yes. There may be a little difference, but that is the general substance of their condition.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",13
"14","22727. What extent of land has each of them?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",14
"15","—From five to eleven acres of arable land, and some six to twelve acres of hill uncultivated; and, I may remark, that in my senior's day, about fourteen of the little farmers were put into one farm, and many more before his day. The tenants have, most of them had to sesk a home where they best could.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",15
"16","22728. How long ago is it since that time?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",16
"17","—The last case was about five years ago, I think. It is about forty years ago since it commenced.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",17
"18","22/29. How many people were removed then—how many families?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",18
"19","—The last time eighteen, I think, were removed out of their houses, and some were disinherited altogether, and some were obliged to take up the subject to the tenant of the main farm.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",19
"20","22730. Had many of them to leave the island altogether?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",20
"21","—A few of them did. Many were old men who had spent their strength in cultivating the hill ground. They might have got a bit of hill ground, but they could not cultivate it. And if it were cultivated it might have been taken into the main farm again.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",21
"22","22731. It is a sheep farm?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",22
"23","—Yes, partly; it is about 1500 acres now.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",23
"24","22732. Do you know the rent of it?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",24
"25","—Something over £400, but I would not say distinctly.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",25
"26","22733. What rent do you pay?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",26
"27","—£5, 10s. for my own place.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",27
"28","22734. Is that about the average?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",28
"29","—It is according to the size. The average rent, taking the whole, is about 11 s. per acre, and the arable",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",29
"30","ground is about £ 1.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",30
"31","22735. What stock are you able to keep?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",31
"32","—The general stock is about two or three cows—some a horse and a cow; and some perhaps have a",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",32
"33","heifer in addition.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",33
"34","22736. Are you allowed to keep sheep?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",34
"35","—Yes, if we could support them ourselves. The time was when we were at liberty to go through the hill, but now there is more exemption from that.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",35
"36","22737. Before the main farm was let, was the hill common among the crofters?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",36
"37","—Yes, among the crofters in that district at least.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",37
"38","22738. Was it not so through the whole island?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",38
"39","—Not in my day. ",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",39
"40","[David Cooper] It was all common in my day. I remember the flocks being on it from different districts. It was all of course counted common. ",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",40
"41","22739. And were they allowed to keep as many cattle and sheep as they liked?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",41
"42","—Yes, and no man to hinder them. ",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",42
"43","22740. Are you a fisherman?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",43
"44","—Yes, our farms are too small to support and us, without our devoting part of our time to the fishing. ",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",44
"45","22741. I suppose the corn and potatoes you raise are not sufficient to support you?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",45
"46","—No.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",46
"47","22742. How long do they last?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",47
"48","—Some for a year, and some for only eight or ten months, according to the size of the farm. And many of us have to maintain a woman. I mean we have to buy her food and also to support her family.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",48
"49","22743. When was that regulation established?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",49
"50","—About five years ago.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",50
"51","22744. Who did it?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",51
"52","—The present tenant; we are not in connection with the proprietor at all; we hold altogether from the present tenant.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",52
"53","22745. Does he live there himself?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",53
"54","—Yes.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",54
"55","22746. What kind of fishing are you engaged in?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",55
"56","—The cod fishing during the winter, and the cod, herring, and lobster fishing in the summer.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",56
"57","22747. Mr Cameron.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",57
"58","—You say you are almost all engaged in the fishing?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",58
"59","—[James Cooper] Almost; that is, we attend so far as we can to our ground; we cultivate our ground in the first place.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",59
"60","22748. Is it the wish of the people whom you represent that they should have sufficiently large farms to enable them to dispense with the fishing?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",60
"61","—Yes, I believe that is the wish of all we represent.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",61
"62","22749. So that if your wishes were carried out, there would be no fishermen?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",62
"63","—Just so.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",63
"64","22750. Is there any complaint of overcrowding —that the people are too crowded together in your district?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",64
"65","—Not too crowded, but we are always driven out to the hill. If we were not driven out there would be",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",65
"66","plenty of room. The district is about 1000 acres or thereby, and there is only about thirteen of these cottars on the main farm.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",66
"67","22751. In point of fact, you have a farm on which you can keep a cow, a horse, and a heifer, on an average?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",67
"68","—Yes.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",68
"69","22752. You occupy yourself in fishing, and you earn money by labouring for the farmer at the rate of 2s. per day for some kinds of work, and 2s. 6d. for other kinds?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",69
"70","—Yes.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",70
"71","22753. Do you think that it is a hard case?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",71
"72","—Yes, I think it is. If we had opportunity of going to the fishing, and making 10s., if the farmer requires us We must go to the farm if called upon, and get 2s. And when we want to go to the farm we are not required.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",72
"73","22754. What do you suggest—and what would you like to see done?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",73
"74","—We would like to have our liberty, to hold from the proprietor and not under a sub-let—not to be in bondage; and we would like more ground—as much as could keep a family without our having to  spend part of our time at the fishing.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",74
"75","22755. In that case would you work for the farmer?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",75
"76","—No, we want to hold from the proprietor as the farmer does.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",76
"77","22756. And supposing you were free, and held from the proprietor, would you work for the farmer?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",77
"78","—Yes, we would be willing to work for him if he required us to work for pay.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",78
"79","22757. And what wages would you expect—higher than you get now?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",79
"80","—Just the current wages.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",80
"81","22758. Would it be higher than you get now?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",81
"82","—Yes; it is not always current wages for a man's work to get 2s.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",82
"83","22759. Current wages are higher?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",83
"84","—Yes, in general, they are.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",84
"85","22760. You think that the arrangements can be made satisfactorily between the farmer and yourselves, so that the farmer would not be under the necessity of importing labourers from outside the island?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",85
"86","—Yes, I believe that. ",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",86
"87","22761. Do you agree in that?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",87
"88","—[David Cooper]. Yes.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",88
"89","22762. You think farmer and crofter would make such a satisfactory arrangement as regards labour, that the farmer would not be under the necessity of importing labour from other parts of the country?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",89
"90","—Yes, it would be no difficulty for him to get labourers for all his work out of the district.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",90
"91","22763. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",91
"92","—What is the name of the proprietor of Stronsay?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",92

"95","—James Twatt.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",95
"96","22765. For whom do you fish?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",96
"97","—We are quite at liberty in regard to the fishing; we can sell to any salesman we think fit. We have no connection with the proprietor or tenant in regard to the fishing.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",97
"98","22766. The tenant does not compel you to fish for him?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",98
"99","—No.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",99
"100","22767. Is there any curer or merchant in the island?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",100
"101","—Yes, but we are not bound to one more than to another.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",101
"102","22768. Are there more than one?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",102
"103","—Yes, there are two cod curers and different herring curers.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",103
"104","22769. And are they competing keenly, so that you may have a good market for the fish?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",104
"105","—Yes, and if not we can send them to Kirkwall.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",105
"106","22770. Is there only one main farm on the island?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",106
"107","—That is the main farm Rothiesholm, but there are different main farms in other districts.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",107
"108","22771. You are speaking of big farms in your own district?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",108
"109","—Yes.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",109
"110","22772. Has it been there always—that big farm, or is it comparatively recent?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",110
"111","—It has always been there from the first I can remember; but many little farms have been put into the big farm.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",111
"112","22773. But there was always a big farm?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",112
"113","—Yes.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",113
"114","22774. Although it has been added to?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",114
"115","—Yes.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",115
"116","22775. You stated in answer to a question, asking what you wanted done for you, that you wanted to be free?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",116
"117","—Free from the bondage of the tenant, so that we should not be obliged to go at his pleasure.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",117
"118","22776. Do you know the rules in other parts of the country that proprietors don't allow such a tiling as sub-letting?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",118
"119","—So far as I am aware there is no sub-letting in our island, except in this district.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",119
"120","22777. Is it not a general rule in Scotland, that the proprietor does not allow anybody to sublet?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",120
"121","—Yes, I understand it is a general rule.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",121
"122","22778. And you want that rule applied to your part of the island?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",122
"123","—Yes.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",123
"124","22779. You say you are rather limited in the extent of ground you have, and would like it enlarged; are you willing to pay a fair rent for what you might get?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",124

"131","—No, he pays less.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",131
"132","22783. It would really be for the interest of the proprietor, as well as yourselves, that you should get this additional land?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",132
"133","—Yes, I believe it would give more money for his ground if we all paid it to himself.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",133
"134","22784. Are the people as well off now as they were in your younger days, when they had the free run of the hills?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",134

"136","22785. In your young days were the people pretty well off?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",136
"137","—Yes, pretty well off; they had the hill before them, and they had their sheep and cattle, and they were paying nothing. Perhaps in some places they paid Is. or only 6d. a head.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",137
"138","22786. At that time—the good old times—were you paying your rent direct to the landlord?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",138

"142","22788. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",142
"143","—How many day's labour does it take you to make a ton of kelp?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",143
"144","— [James Cooper]. According to the circumstances, the weather, and the place we get the sea-weed in.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",144
"145","22789. Can you make 2s. a day at £2, 5s. a ton?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",145
"146","—-I can scarcely calculate on that, because at some of the stands we have to carry it away twice, and then cart it out. We cannot spread it out where it comes. I cannot say how long it takes to make a ton.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",146
"147","22790. What is the price of it in the market just now?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",147

"150","—It is more than that.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",150
"151","22792. It is from drift ware you make the kelp?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",151
"152","—Yes, but it is best kelp, not tang kelp.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",152
"153","22793. You say you are obliged to keep a woman servant; —that is one of your own family you are obliged to supply at Is. a day? ",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",153
"154","—If we have one, and if we have not one of our own we have to get another, and feed and lodge her; and all she gets is Is. a day. We get no benefit by her in the least.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",154
"155","22794. Are the current wages in Orkney Is. a day, besides food, for women?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",155
"156","—I think about Kirkwall, it is more than Is.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",156

"158","—No, they have to provide their own food.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",158

"162","—Yes.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",162
"163","22798. And that is the common wage in your country?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",163
"164","—Yes; and it takes about £3, 10s. to feed her, and there is no compensation for her: it is a gift.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",164
"165","22799. Does the farmer keep any hired servants?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",165
"166","—A few men servants.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",166
"167","22800. How many does he keep?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",167
"168","—About six generally.",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",168
"169","22801. One for every pair of horses?",397,"James Cooper, David Cooper","Orkney, Sanday",169
