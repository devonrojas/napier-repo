"151","—I see there are a great number of the properties very small, according to the valuation roll; for instance, there are fiftythree properties in the parish between £1 and £ 5 rateable value.

"169","24004. Do you think that the houses of the small proprietors are generally better than the houses of Lord Zetland's tenants; or are they just the same sort of houses?",409,"David Isbister","Orkney, Harray",169
"170","—I suppose they are much the same; I could not say.",409,"David Isbister","Orkney, Harray",170
"171","24005. You could not say they are generally different one way or another?",409,"David Isbister","Orkney, Harray",171

"175","—I could not say rightly; I think it was something like £12 and £14 I got.",409,"David Isbister","Orkney, Harray",175
"176","24007. Would your neighbour's cattle be better or worse than yours?",409,"David Isbister","Orkney, Harray",176

"178","24008. Did you hear of any being sold for £20 this year?",409,"David Isbister","Orkney, Harray",178

"183","—A few, but not a great many.",409,"David Isbister","Orkney, Harray",183
"184","24011. The most of them treat their cattle as they treat themselves?",409,"David Isbister","Orkney, Harray",184
"185","— I think so, generally, in small places.",409,"David Isbister","Orkney, Harray",185
