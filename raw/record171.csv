"1","DONALD COLIN CAMERON, Tacksman of Tallisker (56)—examined.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",1
"2","9807. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",2
"3","—Have you any statement to make?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",3
"4","—I have no statement to make; I want to be questioned.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",4
"5","9808. Mr Cameron.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",5
"6","—Have you observed in the newspapers the account of the meeting which the Commissioners held at Bracadale ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",6
"7","—I have.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",7
"8","9809. Did you observe that we examined a witness named John M'Caskill?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",8
"9","—Yes ; he is a merchant, not a cottar.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",9
"10","9810. He made some statements which you no doubt would like to have an opportunity to explain ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",10
"11","—Yes.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",11
"12","9811. M'Caskill, after comparing you to the Babylonians who came after the Assyrians, proceeded to say that another M'Caskill —your predecessor, I presume —had left a remnant of the people for his own convenience, but when Mr Cameron came to Tallisker he would have nothing to do with any of the people, and, as I understand, began to litigate, holding that their being allowed on the tack was not mentioned in the lease?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",12
"13","—There was no litigation, but letters passed.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",13
"14","9812. Did you ever express any feeling of hostility towards the people you saw there?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",14
"15","—No.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",15
"16","9813. So it is not the fact that you said you would have nothing to do with the people?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",16
"17","—No.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",17
"18","9814. This witness also gave us in evidence that the cottars were obliged to work for the tacksman whenever he required them, and that the strongest man only got a shilling a day and a woman sixpence. Will you explain the nature of the arrangement between you and the crofters?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",18
"19","—They are bound to work certain days, but I don't suppose there is a single cottar on the farm who has worked more than twenty days. They were bound to work as I wanted them, but I never pressed them much. In summer I have four hired women to prevent me sending for these people. When I want them on certain occasions they get a shilling a day and their food.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",19
"20","9815. What food do they get?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",20
"21","—Porridge and milk for breakfast, and flour scones and meat and broth or potatoes for dinner.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",21
"22","9816. Do you suppose they get better food when working with you than when working at home ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",22
"23","—I should think they do.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",23
"24","9817. What would that add to the value of their labour?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",24
"25","—A shilling a day. At smearing time I allow them 2s. 6d. a day and board and lodging. ",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",25
"26","9818. How long does smearing last ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",26
"27","—About one month, and as soon as the smearing is done the money is paid down that very night or next morning.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",27
"28","9819. So, for one month of the year—and that not a month of the year when they get much work",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",28
"29","—they receive 2s. 6d. a day and their board?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",29
"30","—Yes.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",30
"31","9820. What arrangements are there in regard to the rent for the houses which they occupy on your farm ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",31
"32","—They do not pay any rent for the houses. Matheson, who is a merchant in Carabost, pays no rent; for the last two or three years he has been paying rent for his father-in-law.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",32
"33","9821. Was there any bad feeling between you and John M'Caskill?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",33
"34","—Yes, there was.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",34
"35","9822. How did it arise ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",35
"36","—I cannot say at all; but Mr Macdonald, the factor, knows I never wanted to evict him. I had him warned through Mr Macdonald, but Mr Macdonald can state that I never wanted to evict him. I only wanted to bring him to his senses. His brother came to me to get the man back, and he got it, and since then he has built a house with stone and lime, which shows he is not afraid of being evicted.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",36
"37","9823. How did he make the money to build a stone and lime house?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",37
"38","—He is a shoemaker and keeps one or two men employed, and keeps a shop, dealing with his neighbours.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",38
"39","9824. Had he any quarrel with you about the shop ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",39
"40","—I wanted himself or his brother to work when I desired him, and he declined.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",40
"41","9825. You had no quarrel with him about the shop ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",41
"42","—No, never.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",42
"43","9826. But because he did not choose to fulfil the conditions on which he had the holding ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",43
"44","—Yes; because he would not take his turn of work when I wanted him with the other people, and the other people would say—Why do we come to work when the other man is let off ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",44
"45","9827. He said that he and his mother, who was about seventy-five years of age, were served with summonses to remove because he refused to work?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",45
"46","—Yes; because the house was hers. He had two brothers living in the house and a sister, and if the sister had gone to work occasionally, I would have been as content as with himself; but the family refused to work at all.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",46
"47","9828. Have you had any trouble with any of the other cottars ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",47
"48","—No.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",48
"49","9829. You believe they are all well-disposed to you ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",49
"50","—Yes. Not one of them appeared at the meeting at Bracadale.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",50
"51","9830. You mean the meeting previous to the arrival of the Commissioners?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",51
"52","—At the meeting to appoint delegates, not a soul of my crofters appeared except John M'Caskill.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",52
"53","9831. Who was at the meeting then ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",53
"54","—The people on the other side.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",54
"55","9832. And they elected John M'Caskill ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",55
"56","—Yes; and at the meeting the other day none of the crofters appeared against me except this John",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",56
"57","M'Caskill.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",57
"58","9833. Do you suppose there was any undue influence used to get M'Caskill elected ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",58
"59","—No; but there was a female emissary sent round to arouse my people to come, and appear against me, and not one of them went. I was told—I cannot vouch for the truth of it, but I will get at it yet",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",59
"60","—that a new dress was offered to one of my oldest crofters to induce him to appear against me—a man named Malcolm Cameron —and the old man said that he had as much land as he wanted, and that he would not appear.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",60
"61","9834. You mean, to appear against you before the Commissioners?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",61
"62","—Yes : he was appointed, I believe, but he never attended the meeting of delegates.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",62
"63","9835. To turn to another branch of the subject, on your farm of Talisker, there is a great deal of land which was formerly occupied by crofters ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",63
"64","—There is a great deal of land.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",64
"65","9836. In your opinion, could that land be resumed by crofters with advantage to themselves and with advantage to the landlord, and also without doing irreparable damage to the rest of the hill ground ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",65
"66","—I think it would do great damage to the rest of the hill ground, because they would have the best and the tenant would have the worst.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",66
"67","9837. But if it were done in moderation—that is, not the whole of the low ground taken, but a certain quantity of the farm taken and divided into small holdings —would that interfere with the whole of Talisker ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",67
"68","—Yes, I should let them have the hill land with the low land.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",68
"69","9838. And suppose they could not stock the hill land, what then?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",69
"70","—That is a question between themselves and the landlord.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",70
"71","9839. But you think it would not answer to give them the low land without the hill land?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",71
"72","—Yes, I have told Macleod that before.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",72
"73","9840. Would it not be possible in this way —supposing they had good sized crofts, and cultivated them fairly and well according to modern skill, using their best endeavours to make the land what it should be, and supposing the tacksman should then have the right, on paying for it to the crofters, of a run over the land for his sheep in winter?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",73
"74","—I do not see how that would work. It would be better to give them good-sized crofts and hill pasture as well, and let them keep sheep of their own.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",74
"75","9841. You are aware that in some parts of the mainland that system is adopted and found very beneficial, and sometimes they get one-third of the rent back from the tacksman ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",75
"76","—-I do not see how that would work upon Talisker.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",76
"77","9842. You know my part of the country?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",77
"78","—Yes ; you have à good deal more of high land than I have.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",78
"79","9843. And that is all the more reason for the tacksman wanting to winter his sheep in some good place?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",79
"80","—Well, I do not see how it would work.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",80
"81","9844. But, as I understand, the lease to the tacksman would be a lease of low land for his sheep in winter?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",81
"82","—Yes.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",82
"83","9845. If he had, by arrangement entered into with consent of the landlord, the right of running his sheep over the same land, and perhaps with the advantage of sown grass, which he has not now, would that not pay and enable him to pay money to the crofter instead of to the landlord ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",83
"84","—Well, you see, we put the sheep up to the top every afternoon at one o'clock. We have them below in the forenoon, and we put them up in the afternoon to get shelter and dry beds, which they could not have on cultivated land.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",84
"85","9846. Could you not move them from the cultivated land in the same way as you do now!",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",85
"86","—Well, I doubt there would be nothing for them to eat.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",86
"87","9847. You admit it is done in other parts of the country, where the land is worse than on your farm?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",87
"88","—Yes; but you have more heather in Lochaber than we have. It is all green land.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",88
"89","9848. Can you suggest anything that might be done, so far as lies within your knowledge, to improve the position of the cottars on the land under your occupation ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",89
"90","—I would give them more land decidedly. The proprietor should do it.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",90
"91","9849. Where would you give it?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",91
"92","—On differeuts parts of the farm, wherever he wanted.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",92
"93","9850. On your farm ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",93
"94","— Yes. ",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",94
"95","9851. I understood you to say that none of it could be spared.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",95
"96","—Oh, after my lease is out. ",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",96
"97","9852. You do not suppose that I imagine anything could be done during the currency of your lease, because neither landlord nor anybody else can break that agreement; but I am talking of the interests of the country in the future, and what might be done if opportunity arose, and I am glad to find you think that the cottars on the farm of Tallisker might be allowed to have more land without detriment to the sheep farmer?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",97
"98","—Well, of course, the farmer would require to get a deduction of rent.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",98
"99","9853. Of course, proportionate to the land taken from him?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",99
"100","—Yes.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",100
"101","9854. But do you think it would be such an injury to the sheep farmer as would render it almost impossible to let the bulk of your high hill grazing?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",101
"102","—You would require to keep fewer sheep, and the rent would be reduced. It is altogether a question with the landlord.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",102
"103","9855. Then do you say that you approve of the cottars getting more land after your lease expires?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",103
"104","—What I should like to see done is to give the crofters low land and hill land as well.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",104
"105","9856. And to take it off that portion of the farm of Tallisker which would not interfere with the letting of the rest ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",105
"106","—-And the tenant to get valuation for what is taken off.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",106
"107","9857. What tenant?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",107
"108","—The tacksman.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",108
"109","9858. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",109
"110","—What is the extent of your farm of Tallisker?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",110
"111","—Between 11,000 and 12,000 acres.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",111
"112","9859. How much old arable land do you suppose is on it —land that was once cultivated?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",112
"113","—Several thousand acres —perhaps 2000 acres—that had been under cultivation perhaps sixty or seventy years ago.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",113
"114","9860. How many people are on your farm of Talisker altogether—shepherds, servants, and cottars?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",114
"115","—Over 200.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",115
"116","9861. How many would you find it necessary to have to work your farm supposing there were no cottars there?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",116
"117","—I have nine shepherds, two married ploughmen, and a gardener.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",117
"118","9862. Are these all the out servants?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",118
"119","—Yes.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",119
"120","9863. The nine shepherds are dotted about the whole of the farm ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",120
"121","—They are scattered all over the farm.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",121
"122","9864. And that is the staff which you ordinarily require to work the farm?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",122
"123","—Yes, except for a few weeks in summer. I only cultivate 25 acres altogether, and I require a few people now and again to assist in securing the crop and at the clipping.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",123
"124","9865. Do you know a place called Cuillore?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",124
"125","—Yes; that is on Mr Scott's farm.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",125
"126","9866. Do you think it hard to see so many people on that small township and so much of Duirinish in the hands of one man?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",126
"127","—I always heard of Mr Scott that he was exceedingly kind to his people.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",127
"128","9867. I am putting the general question. Don't you think it hard to see so many of your fellow-countrymen crowded together and living on that small spot, and thousands upon thousands of acres in the hands of one man?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",128
"129","—I decline to answer that question ; I don't know much about it. However, if you press me to give an answer, I think they would be better off if they had more room.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",129
"130","9868. Did I understand you to state, in reply to Lochiel, that there are parts of your farm that could be sliced off, hill ground and low ground?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",130
"131","—Or fenced off.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",131
"132","9869. That would provide a good number of nice crofts paying from £10 to £30 of rent, and still leave a very handsome remainder for a big farm?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",132
"133","—Yes, that could be done no doubt out of 10,000 or 11,000 acres.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",133
"134","9870. How long has your lease to run?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",134
"135","—Seven years.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",135
"136","9871. Have you a break in your lease?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",136
"137","—No, I wish I had.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",137
"138","9872. Supposing your lease were expiring next year, would you renew it on the same terms?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",138
"139","—I could not. ",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",139
"140","9873. It is not merely that you would not, but you could not?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",140
"141","—I could not with profit to myself.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",141
"142","9874. Do you think that small crofters such as I have referred to would be able to pay in proportion as much as you pay?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",142
"143","—I don't think it.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",143
"144","9875. We have always heard that stated?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",144
"145","—I don't think it.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",145
"146","9876. Tell me why you think that?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",146
"147","—Because families of crofters living on £ 30 crofts would be rather expensive in their habits. They could not all make a living out of the land at the rent I pay; but if they got it cheap enough, I have no doubt they could.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",147
"148","9877. Then do you put it in this form, that if 10,000 acres of land in the possession of one man were divided amongst thirty, it is impossible for those thirty to pay such a rent as the one man pays?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",148
"149","—I say so honestly, the landlord would suffer in his purse.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",149
"150","9878. The Chairman.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",150
"151","—What is the position of your dwelling-house; are you near the sea or in the interior?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",151
"152","—About a quarter of a mile from the sea.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",152
"153","9879. Are you sheltered from the sea?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",153
"154","—Yes, very well sheltered.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",154
"155","9880. Is the house on high ground?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",155
"156","—No, it is only 20 feet above high-water mark.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",156
"157","9881. Have you a good garden?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",157
"158","—Very good.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",158
"159","9882. A walled garden ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",159
"160","—No, there is a hedge round about it.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",160
"161","9883. A good deal has been said in the south of Scotland of the capacity these islands might have for growing garden vegetables for the supply of Glasgow or the great towns generally, have you found that garden vegetables thrive well?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",161
"162","—Well, in some seasons they do ; but one gale of wind may destroy the whole garden, as it did in October last year. I had not a single cabbage in my garden that I could eat last winter after that gale.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",162
"163","9884. What vegetables of the better sort do you cultivate besides cabbages?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",163
"164","—Carrots, beetroot, peas, and beans ; but sometimes a gale of wind comes and knocks the peas down, so that I have none.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",164
"165","9885. Do you think that garden vegetables are a precarious crop?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",165
"166","—I should say so most decidedly.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",166
"167","9886. Then you can hardly imagine that the crofters, with all the industry possible, would be able to raise vegetables for exportation?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",167
"168","—Nothing but potatoes, if the potatoes would grow.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",168
"169","9887. Of late years, have you found the potatoes in your garden and fields deteriorating?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",169
"170","—I had not a single potato after the month of April last year, they all rotted in the field.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",170
"171","9888. Have you changed your seed occasionally?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",171
"172","—Every second year, and the potatoes were like nuts or small apples.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",172
"173","9889. You consider the potato very precarious?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",173
"174","—Most precarious. No man in the Highlands should depend upon it.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",174
"175","9890. Have you any small fruits, such as currants and gooseberries?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",175
"176","—Yes, and a few apples and pears.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",176
"177","9891. Do they grow and ripen well?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",177
"178","—In dry seasons they do, but not in wet seasons.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",178
"179","9892. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",179
"180","—You said you employed smearers at 2s. 6d. a day ; are these all your own cottars ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",180
"181","—-Not all my own. I would take as many as would come, but I have to get people.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",181
"182","9893. How many cottars have you on whom you can caU to do your work at Is. a day?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",182
"183","—Between men and women, about twenty, I should think; but I never have more than three or four at a time.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",183
"184","9894. But there are about twenty families?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",184
"185","—Yes, about twenty families. ",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",185
"186","9895. And you can call either for male labour at Is. or female labour Cameron. at 6d.?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",186
"187","—Yes, with their food; but I never insist upon it except in the case of those who remain at home. I never prevent a man going away to earn his living.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",187

They were bound to come and smear wherever they were. I had only half my number of smearers that year, and I certainly warned them, and they went away. He worked in the south during the time. I had him warned next summer after he came home.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",198
"199","9901. Did he go ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",199

"206","—No, but I am sure he is far better off than he would be with me.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",206
"207","9905. He was just selected as an example, I suppose?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",207

"212","9907. How many years ago did you enter?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",212
"213","—Thirty-three years ago.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",213

"221","—I think so.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",221
"222","9912. Did it ever occur to you that it would be equitable to make some rise in your wages corresponding to the general rise of wages in the country?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",222
"223","—They never made a complaint to me, and they were willing to come.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",223
"224","9913. You say that a man does not work more than twenty days in the year?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",224
"225","—I am sure not.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",225

"227","—Yes. ",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",227
"228","9915. It is a considerable tax upon a man's earnings in the year?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",228

"233","—Yes.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",233
"234","9918. Is the food carried to them in the fields ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",234
"235","—No, they get it in my own kitchen and they feed with my own house servants.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",235
"236","9919. You mentioned the number of labourers, such as shepherds, in your employment. Have you any drainers ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",236
"237","—There are four men from Bracadale who drain for me sometimes, and those four men earn £60,",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",237
"238","£70, or £80 a year. They take draining by contract.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",238

"240","—Well, they don't care for it.",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",240
"241","9921. You have the system of superficial drainage that we have in the lowlands ?",171,"Donald Colin Cameron","Skye, Portree",241
"242","—Yes. They only clean the drains. I give them 8s. 6d. for 100 roods for cleaning. I have just these four men who come to me year after year, and I don't like to part with them.
