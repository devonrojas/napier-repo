"1","JAMES M'CORQUIDALE, Crofter, Carinish (77)—examined.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",1
"2","12317. The Chairman.—Have you been freely elected a delegate?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",2
"3","—Yes.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",3
"4","12318. How many people were present at the meeting when you were elected?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",4
"5","—Every one of them—twenty-two in number.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",5
"6","12319. You have a statement to submit to the Commission?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",6
"7","—Yes. The following statement has been agreed to by the crofters of Carinish, at a meeting held on the 25th May. In the year 1814, I, James M'Corquidale, remember the whole township of Carinish being in the hands of eight tenants, paying £7, 10s. each; now there are twenty-two tenants, paying upwards of £140. Twelve crofts are divided into half crofts, with two families on each. Besides the crofters, there are twenty-two cottars, making fifty-five or fifty-six families. The place is greatly over-crowded. Carinish is the highest rented farm in North Uist. The rent was fixed when the kelp was in great demand; the crofters were manufacturing the kelp at £ 1 , 15s. per ton, and the proprietor selling it at £21 per ton; but as there is no kelp made now, the rent should be reduced. Our hill pasture is the poorest on the estate ; and although we keep some sheep, we generally lose them in winter for the want of proper grazing for them. We have still some cattle and horses left, but they are reduced to skin and bone, and they will not sell at the July market owing to their miserable condition. Our liabilities are so great, that supposing we sold all our cattle we would still be left in debt. We are deeply in arrears to the proprietor, and in debt to Glasgow merchants for meal and seed this year; and also heavy in debt to local merchants, tailors, shoemakers, &c. Another cause of complaint is the drainage money; we are still paying the interest as part of our rent. Poor-rates and school-rates, &c, are charged on this drainage money, which has been refunded to Government a long time ago. All the drains made with that money are now quite useless, and require to be re-opened at once, as they do more harm than good to the ground. What is absolutely required is more land, with an assurance that the land is ours as long as we pay fair rent for fair value. The Government must interfere to guarantee each crofter in his holding. We will be glad to answer any questions the Commissioners like to ask us as far as we know.—JAMES M'CORQUIDALE, ROBERT FERGUSON.'",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",7
"8","12320. Professor Mackinnon.—Was your father one of the eight tenants in Carinish in 1814?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",8
"9","—Yes.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",9
"10","12321. Were your circumstances then much more comfortable than they are now ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",10
"11","—Yes, very much.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",11
"12","12322. How many cows did you keep at that time?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",12
"13","—Each had eight cows with their followers.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",13
"14","12323. How many horses and sheep ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",14
"15","—Two horses and about twenty sheep.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",15
"16","12324. Were you buying any meal from Glasgow then ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",16
"17","—No, we did not require it. There was plenty meal growing out of the ground, and potatoes as well.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",17
"18","12325. Did you ever use to sell meal and potatoes at that time?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",18
"19","—Yes, we did, at 20d. per barrel for potatoes.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",19
"20","12326. Do you ever sell meal or potatoes now?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",20
"21","—No, we are always buying them.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",21
"22","12327. How long does your own meal last you generally?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",22
"23","—This year all the meal that was made in Carinish would not supply the people for a month.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",23
"24","12328. And how long did the potatoes last?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",24
"25","—They lasted this year till the middle of spring.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",25
"26","12329. Did you buy potatoes after that, or did you do without potatoes ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",26
"27","— We buy potatoes when our own supply is done.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",27
"28","12330. Where do you get potatoes for seed?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",28
"29","—We got them this year from the factor.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",29
"30","12331. You had to pay for them, of course ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",30
"31","—We were glad to get them even for payment.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",31
"32","12332. Did you get a present of them this season?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",32
"33","—I don't know. They were not promised to us for nothing. It may be that they will not be charged for.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",33
"34","12333. Then did you get seed for your corn, or had you to buy seed ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",34
"35","—We had no oats. We got them from the factor. We got a great deal from him both of barley and oats.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",35
"36","12334. What is your principal crop here? Is it barley?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",36
"37","—Partly barley.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",37
"38","12335. Do you plant any other green crop than potatoes? Do you plant turnips or any of these roots ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",38
"39","—No.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",39
"40","12336. Is your ground not suitable for them?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",40
"41","—The ground is suitable enough, but people would steal the turnips.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",41
"42","12337. What is your summing?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",42
"43","—Five cows and a two-year-old; two horses; eight sheep. That is what I am allowed to keep.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",43
"44","12338. What is your present rent?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",44
"45","—£8, 10s.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",45
"46","12339. Do you consider that rent too high?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",46
"47","—Certainly I do. I consider it twice as much as the croft is worth.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",47
"48","12340. You have cottars among you?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",48
"49","—Yes.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",49
"50","12341. Have they lands also?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",50
"51","—No, they have no lands.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",51
"52","12342. Do they not get a bit to plant potatoes or a little oats?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",52
"53","—Yes; they get some potato ground from the crofters.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",53
"54","12343. Don't they pay rent for their houses to the laird?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",54
"55","—I am not certain, but it is said they are charged 10s. for peat ground and houses.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",55
"56","12344. Did any of the increased number of tenants since 1814 come from other quarters, or did they all grow upon the place ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",56
"57","—Some came in upon us from other places.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",57
"58","12345. But I suppose a good many of them were the sons of former crofters, who would get half of the father's croft?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",58
"59","—Yes, there are some in that way whose fathers' crofts were divided among their children. It was from the other side of the country that some of the people of Carinish came who have increased the population of the place. ",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",59
"60","12346. What place did they come from?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",60
"61","—They came from various townships.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",61
"62","12347. Did some of them come from places from which people were sent away ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",62
"63","—Baile-mhic-phail, Grenitote, Bernera, and Caolas.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",63
"64","12348. Where did the cottars come from?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",64
"65","—Some who lost their lands, and widows. There have been always cottars, but their number was increased",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",65
"66","by those who fell into arrear and had to give up their land.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",66
"67","12349. Are they allowed to come there by the laird and factor, or have they come without leave ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",67
"68","—It was neither the present proprietor nor factor that brought things to this pass. We are perfectly satisfied with our present factor. He never oppressed us in any way.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",68
"69","12350. I know they came long ago, but I want to know whether they came with the will of the laird and factor when they did come ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",69
"70","—I believe some of them may have come into the place with his permission, but most of them were born in the place.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",70
"71","12351. Do any of them keep cattle and sheep?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",71
"72","—Yes; two at any rate have cattle and sheep.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",72
"73","12352. But I suppose a good many of them have no cow ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",73
"74","—Yes, most of them are without a cow.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",74
"75","12353. Or sheep ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",75
"76","—They have all sheep.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",76
"77","12354. Where do these sheep feed ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",77
"78","—Upon the crofters' ground.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",78
"79","12355. Do they pay anything to the crofters for that?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",79
"80","—Not a penny.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",80
"81","12356. Do they give them any recompense in the shape of labour?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",81
"82","— Not a bit.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",82
"83","12357. Then these cottars, of course, are a great burden to the crofters?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",83
"84","—Yes, a very great burden.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",84
"85","12358. Has the pasture of the crofters at Carinish been diminished since 1814?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",85
"86","—No, only diminished in the sense of people being thrown in upon them. There were only eight to begin with.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",86
"87","12359. Was there any prohibition on the estate, so far as you know, of subdividing crofts ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",87
"88","—Not at that time.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",88
"89","12360. Is there now ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",89
"90","—Yes, there is an estate regulation against it just now, but it is not observed.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",90
"91","12361. How many crofters do you think could now live comfortably upon that same place ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",91
"92","—Twelve.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",92
"93","12362. How many cows would you give to each of them ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",93
"94","—I would give each of them seven cows.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",94
"95","12363. How many sheep ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",95
"96","—Twenty.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",96
"97","12364. And horses ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",97
"98","—Two.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",98
"99","12365. What rent would you consider fair?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",99
"100","—I am not able to say what would be considered a reasonable rent.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",100
"101","12366. Do you think the present total rent of £140 is too high?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",101
"102","—Yes, much too high.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",102
"103","12367. Would you think £ 10 each too high a rent for these twelve men ",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",103
"104","—It would be quite reasonable.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",104
"105","12368. Are you aware of any potatoes having been sold out of North Uist this year ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",105
"106","—Yes; they were sending potatoes to Glasgow. Those who have machair land—that is on the west side — sent the potatoes to purchase meal. ",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",106
"107","12369. Do you think they sold all their potatoes?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",107
"108","—I think they sold them all. I was in search of potatoes, and I could not get a single barrel.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",108
"109","12370. Where? ",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",109
"110","— Balemore, Knock-an-torran, Knock-an-lin, and Paiblesgarry.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",110
"111","12371. Do you make kelp now at all?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",111
"112","—No; that was our great misfortune. When the kelp was going on people were getting their living. They would get meal to support their families, and also some money that would pay their rents.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",112
"113","12372. When did it cease to be manufactured ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",113
"114","—Seven or eight years ago—perhaps ten.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",114
"115","12373. Why did it cease ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",115
"116","—It was not remunerative. It was not worth the proprietor's while to keep it on.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",116
"117","12374. What was the price?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",117
"118","—The people who worked it got 35s. per ton for manufacturing it.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",118
"119","12375. Did they not get much more than that long ago?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",119
"120","—Yes, when it fetched a high price they got £ 2 and £2, 10s.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",120
"121","12376. What would the proprietor get ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",121
"122","—1 cannot tell that.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",122
"123","12377. It is said in the paper that you were manufacturing kelp at £1, 15s. and the proprietor was selling it at £21 ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",123
"124","—That was long ago, when there were only eight people in Carinish—in the year 1814 or thereabout.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",124
"125","12378. How many men would be working altogether in making the kelp ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",125
"126","—There may have been four in a family that worked together, and that family would make about ten tons in the summer season.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",126
"127","12379. They paid the rent and something more with the kelp in those times ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",127
"128","—They would take their feeding out of it first of all, and then what remained would go to pay the rent. In some cases they could pay the whole rent, in others the half, and so on.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",128
"129","12380. At your place do most of the people wear clothes of their own wool or cloth bought in shops ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",129
"130","—At present we buy out of the shops, but in those times we did not require to go to the shop ; we had wool of our own, and women to make cloth of it.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",130
"131","12381. But do not some of them get their cloth made by their own wives?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",131
"132","—Yes, if they have the wooL",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",132
"133","12382. How many weavers are there in Carinish?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",133
"134","—There are three weavers, all women.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",134
"135","12383. Are they constantly employed ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",135
"136","—They get plenty of work if they got payment for it.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",136
"137","12384. Is there a good deal of knitting of stockings and hose done by the women ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",137
"138","—Yes, they can do that very well.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",138
"139","12385. Do they get a good sale for them ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",139
"140","—Yes ; sixpence for a pair of socks. We send them to the shops, but we sell them of course to everybody who buys.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",140
"141","12386. How much for hose ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",141
"142","—They don't make hose. I remember the time when hose were made.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",142
"143","12387. Do they make long stockings?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",143
"144","—Yes; they ask 1s. 6d. for long stockings that come up to the knee.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",144
"145","12388. Do they provide the wool themselves for these prices ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",145
"146","—Yes. To those who are hard up and without food, even that is considered a great benefit.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",146
"147","12389. Has there been any attempt made to get up a scheme to provide the women of this and surrounding places with regular occupation at a better price than that ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",147
"148","—Yes.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",148
"149","12390. Who did it ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",149
"150","—Lady Cathcart. They were making home-made clothes and stockings. I am not certain what price they got for them, buf I heard them say they got a good price, and could make a good living out of it.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",150
"151","12391. Has that ceased?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",151
"152","—I have not heard of it for the last few years.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",152
"153","12392. Why?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",153
"154","—I don't know why. The scheme worked only on Lady Cathcart's own estate.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",154
"155","12393. There was nothing of the sort here ",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",155
"156","—No.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",156
"157","12394. Do you think it would be a benefit if somebody would undertake it ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",157
"158","—Certainly it would be a benefit.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",158
"159","12395. Do you think the women would really produce a steady supply of hosiery that would be profitable to themselves and to the person taking it off their hands ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",159
"160","—Yes, certainly it would.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",160
"161","12396. The Chairman.—From what source is the rent usually paid ? Is it paid from wages earned elsewhere, or from the sale of animals ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",161
"162","—Some from the sale of stock ; others out of the proceeds of the east coast fishing.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",162
"163","12397. How is the stock sold ? Is it sent to market, or do dealers come round ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",163
"164","—Dealers come round us here.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",164
"165","12398. Was there ever any complaint in this island of stock being compulsorily bought by factors or proprietors ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",165
"166","—There was nothing of that sort with the present proprietor or factor, but I saw the day when that was done — when the stock was taken away, and they would not tell the price that would be given for it.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",166
"167","12399. At what age do you sell the young cattle?—The stots are sold at a year old.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",167
"168","12400. Your memory must extend fifty years back?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",168
"169","—Yes.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",169
"170","12401. What was the price given for a one-year-old animal fifty years ago ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",170
"171","—£2.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",171
"172","12402. What is the average price for such an animal now ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",172
"173","—£6 or £7 last year, which was an exceptional year.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",173
"174","12403. Is the quality of the animals better now than it used to be?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",174
"175","—No, it is worse.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",175
"176","12404. Has there been no effort made to improve the breed by the introduction of good bulls ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",176
"177","—Yes.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",177
"178","12405. Has that not produced any good effect?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",178
"179","—Yes, it was of great service. We got a bull from Balranald, and we believe it was the means of adding £200 to the township within three years' time.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",179
"180","12406. Then is the present deterioration of the character of the cattle owing to the want of food?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",180
"181","—The want of grass and provender. The ground does not yield fruit either in the shape of seed or of straw as it used to do.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",181
"182","12407. You have stated that you had on your croft five cows ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",182
"183","—That is my summing.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",183
"184","12408. How many do you actually keep ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",184
"185","—Three cows and three stirks.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",185
"186","12409. Can you count upon being able to sell a stirk every year?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",186
"187","—Yes. I have at least one every year.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",187
"188","12410. You said that the cottars were a great burden to you. How do the cottars earn their subsistence ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",188
"189","—I cannot well tell, but in some way or another. They must needs live upon the crofters, and by shell-fish, and in other ways.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",189
"190","12411. You said that the cottars paid no rent, and gave no labour. Are they of no use to you in time of harvest, or in cutting peats, or any other small labour ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",190
"191","—They help us in casting peats now and again, but we pay them for it. ",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",191
"192","12412. You said that the people were afraid to sow turnips, because the turnips might possibly be stolen. Is anything else ever stolen ? Do sheep sometimes disappear in the country ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",192
"193","—Yes, such things are known as sheep disappearing. ",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",193
"194","12413. Do you think it would be very useful if there were more enclosures and fences round the hill pasture? —Yes, that would be of service.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",194
"195","12414. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—You stated in answer to a question that if the number of families was reduced to twelve, £10 would not be an unreasonable rent ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",195
"196","—Yes.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",196
"197","12415. I presume you mean along with that that all the cottars should be taken off them ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",197
"198","—Every one of them.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",198
"199","12416. Do you buy any fodder or any provision for the animals?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",199
"200","—Yes, we do. There are some in Carinish that paid £30 this last year for provender for themselves and their stock, others paid £10, and others £5.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",200
"201","12417. You said, in answer to Lord Napier, that you could on an average sell a beast every year. In point of fact, the money you get for that would not be all profit, because you must make a certain deduction for what you paid for the wintering ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",201
"202","—Yes.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",202
"203","12418. Have you been in Uist all your life?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",203
"204","—Yes, ever since I was born.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",204
"205","12419. Will you state your opinion as to the condition of people like yourself in your younger days compared with what it is now ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",205
"206","—The difference is very great. I remember when I was a young man fifty years ago, there used to be cargoes of barley and cargoes of potatoes exported from North Uist. They did not require to go to the militia or elsewhere. They would get plenty of work at home, plenty of food and clothes.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",206
"207","12420. Have their circumstances of late years been getting worse and worse ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",207
"208","—Certainly they have. For the last fifty-four years I have been continuously cropping the same ground, and how can you expect good crops out of such ground as that ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",208
"209","12421. Do you know by repute or otherwise that people who have held large tacks in North Uist have made large sums of money, and left the country ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",209
"210","—I am not aware. I cannot charge my memory with any one that left the country after having made money in such a way.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",210
"211","12422. Were the big tacksmen thriving then or not thriving, so far as repute went ",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",211
"212","—They themselves would know their own circumstances best, but the general opinion was that they throve, well. ",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",212
"213","12423. You stated that under the present factor, and under the present proprietor, there was no such thing as animals being taken away by ground officers or others without a price being fixed, but you have heard of it in former times. Will you name the proprietor and factor under whom the thing was done?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",213
"214","—The practice prevailed under Lord Macdonald's proprietorship, and when Allan Cameron was factor.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",214
"215","12424. Was Allan Cameron a stranger?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",215
"216","—He came from Mull.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",216
"217","12425. How long was he factor, and how long since?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",217
"218","—I believe he was factor for about thirty years. His factorship came to an end about forty years ago, but I cannot give accurate dates.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",218
"219","12426. Was any beast taken from yourself?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",219
"220","—Yes.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",220
"221","12427. Will you explain how the thing was done?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",221
"222","—The ground officer, Angus Macdonald, came and gathered all the cattle in the place. Any animal he himself would choose to mark out he would carry away. He would send it off to market, and we would not hear any price fixed for it till after it was sold.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",222
"223","12428. What was his object in taking it in this manner?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",223
"224","—For the rent.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",224
"225","12429. Did you always get credit for the beast sold in settling for the rent?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",225
"226","—Yes.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",226
"227","12430. Did you get the market price for it ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",227
"228","—We did not know what price it would fetch at the market. They would just give us any price it pleased them to give.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",228
"229","12431. They put whatever price they thought proper to your credit in the rent ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",229
"230","—Yes, exactly.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",230
"231","12432. Was that considered by yourself and the people at the time a very great hardship?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",231
"232","—Yes, and it was very unjust as well",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",232
"233","12433. Was there the shadow of a doubt in your mind that more was got for it at the market than was credited ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",233
"234","—That was our belief, but of course we could not tell. I wish to state that for the last twelve years we are taking our meal home from Glasgow, and though we have stock, it is not our own. A merchant of the name of Thomas Martin, Glasgow, has provided for a large number of the inhabitants. Donald M'Lean, a local merchant in Carinish, also deals. Twelve bags of meal come with every steamer, and I don't think he gets a penny for it, but distributes it among the poor people of the place. He has not a house, and we thought it exceedingly desirable that he should just get forty feet of that ground that we pay rent for, if the proprietor or factor would see fit to give it to him, in order to provide a suitable store, for such a man is very much required, and ought to be encouraged. ",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",234
"235","12434. Have you spoken to the factor about it ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",235
"236","—No, never.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",236
"237","12435. Do you complain of the prices of the local merchants ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",237
"238","—We do not ask the price until we are paying for it, if indeed we can pay for it. Indian meal is 27s. or 28s. per bag over head; flour 35s., and oatmeal about £2 per bag.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",238
"239","12436. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—Is that at Glasgow or here ?",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",239
"240","—In Carinish.",216,"James Mccorquidale","North Uist, Loch Eport",240
