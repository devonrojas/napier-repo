"4","—' Unto the Honourable the Royal Commissioner, appointed to inquire into the Condition of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, the Statement of Angus Munn (44), crofter and fisherman, Heanish, Tyree; Humbly sheweth, That we have been forcibly deprived of our holdings of two crofts, during our father and mother's lifetime, to make room for another party who got into the factor's favour, and on going to his Grace the Duke of Argyle to Mull, he advised us to come home and that he himself would look after it. On the factor becoming aware of this he reported that we had no stock to stock the ground with, and on being challenged by the factor as to the stock, we had to call witnesses to let them see what number of stock we had; and on the factor's becoming aware of this, he, in a rage, asked us about the stock. Having replied in the affirmative, he said, "" Did I not tell you that you were not to have a hoof on the grass after a certain day?"" On being questioned as to what was to be done with them, "" Drown them,"" said he. We had then to confine them in our byres until some of our cattle died. Now, on his Grace having found this out, and that we were able to stock the ground, he further instructed the factor to reinstate us on the crofts; but after all we never got but one of the crofts we had before, after being two years from us, and much rent was imposed upon us on that croft than what was before. Mr Geikie was the ruling factor for his Grace at that time. The crofters grieve for high rents, as it was about doubled within the last thirty years, exclusive of rates; and our land, by constant rotation, does not yield the one half of the produce it used to do previous to the rent being raised, and by that reason, we are buying our meal regularly from the south, and also feeding stuff for our cattle. The most useful part of our common pasture was taken from us and added to  the one in whose hands the greater part of the township is. Our demands are",561,"Angus Munn","Argyll, Tyree",4
