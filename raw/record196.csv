"1","DONALD BLACK (M.B. Glasgow) (44)—examined.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",1
"2","11511. Sheriff Nicolson. —How long have you lived here ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",2
"3","—Upwards of six years.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",3
"4","11512. You came from Mull to this country ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",4
"5","—Yes, from Bunessan.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",5
"6","11513. And, as we have seen to-day, you know the language of the people well and can converse freely with them in it ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",6
"7","—Yes.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",7
"8","11514. What do you think of the condition of the people here compared with Mull, where you lived before? —The crofters of Mull are better off as regards their house accommodation than they are here, but I don't know if they are better off as regards stock.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",8
"9","11515. Are the houses of the psople here generally poor in accommodation?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",9
"10","—I think so.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",10
"11","11516. Is the custom of having cattle under the same roof with human beings still prevalent ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",11
"12","—It is to a large extent.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",12
"13","11517. Do you think that has had any prejudicial effect on the health of the people?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",13
"14","—Owing to their being constantly in the fresh air, I don't think it has the injurious effect it would otherwise have, but when fevers occur it always intensifies the illness.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",14
"15","11518. Of course, it makes it very difficult to keep a house clean when you have to go first through the place of the cattle ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",15
"16","—Very difficult. ",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",16
"17","11519. Have you noticed any improvement in their houses in that respect during the short time you have been here ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",17
"18","—I cannot say I have noticed much.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",18
"19","11520. You have not noticed any signs of progress ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",19
"20","—I believe, on the whole, they are cleaner.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",20
"21","11521. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—And that is growing?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",21
"22","—Yes, growing.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",22
"23","11522. Sherif Nicolson.—As to their health generally, what have you to say?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",23
"24","—The public health is pretty good, except in winter and spring, spring especially. A good many chest complaints are prevalent in spring, pneumonia and some bronchitic affections, which I attribute to people",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",24
"25","working continually upon the land with the crooked spade, poorly fed, and in that way reducing the body, and making it very liable to chills.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",25
"26","11523. What are the diseases most prevalent among them ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",26
"27","—Pulmonary complaints in winter and spring, affections of the joints and rheumatism, which are very common in the chronic form here. Scrofulous affections are not common here.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",27
"28","11524. It is supposed that at one time consumption was very rare in these islands ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",28
"29","—It is not my experience. ",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",29
"30","11525. Was it not rarer in former times than it is at present?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",30
"31","—I believe that was the fault of their not being able to diagnose properly.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",31
"32","11526. They used to be liable also to fevers to a very great extent?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",32
"33","—They are considerably liable to fever still in this parish.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",33
"34","11527. What kind of fever?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",34
"35","—Typhus fever.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",35
"36","11528. And I suppose the accommodation of their houses, and their proximity to each other, make it very difficult to resist the spread of these diseases ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",36
"37","—Very difficult, along with bad drainage.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",37
"38","11529. Do you find that the children are properly clothed generally 1",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",38
"39","—Well, upon the whole they are. You meet with exceptions, but upon the whole, they are fairly well clad. Of course there are cases where clothing is pretty scanty.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",39
"40","11530. You don't think they are so badly clothed that it has any generally injurious effect upon their growth or health ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",40
"41","—I don't think so. It is insufficient feeding that has to do with their health, as I find, especially tea-drinking.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",41
"42","11531. A man to-day spoke about giving tea to the children. Is it common ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",42
"43","—Quite prevalent.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",43
"44","11532. I suppose you don't consider that good for children ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",44
"45","—I think it most injurious.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",45
"46","11533. In the absence of milk, what would you recommend them to drink?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",46
"47","—Beer, if they had cheap beer; certainly anything but tea. I think it is doing a great deal of harm to the people, especially to the rising generation.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",47
"48","11534. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—At what age would you begin to give beer to the children ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",48
"49","—At a year or two or three years of age. I think if there was cheap beer made it would be much healthier than living upon tea.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",49
"50","11535. You stated that the use of the cas-chrom had a prejudicial effect upon the system ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",50
"51","—I did not mean there was any specialty connected with the cas-chrom more than any other kind of spade. I mean the general labour of spring weakens the bodies of these labouring men, and renders them, on that account, much more liable to receive chills and colds.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",51
"52","11536. Do I understand from you then that some of that spring labour, as a rule, ought to be done by animals? ",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",52
"53","—A good deal ought to be done by animals. I have never seen so many lazy beds as I have seen in this country—that particular method of planting potatoes.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",53
"54","11537. Are you aware there are an unusual number of deaths among children ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",54
"55","—Yes, a good many before five years of age.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",55
"56","11538. We are also told that children up to the age of twelve to fourteen or fifteen look pallid and gaunt, but then such of them as live grow up to be strong people. Have you observed that?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",56
"57","—I have.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",57
"58","11539. I mean that they do not look very healthy up to that age, but when they come to that age, in many cases, they spring up into strongmen and women ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",58
"59","—That is true.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",59
"60","11540. Can you account for that?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",60
"61","—It is very difficult for me at the present moment to give you a reason to account for that.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",61
"62","11541. Is it not really because the weakest all die off?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",62
"63","—I don't think so.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",63
"64","11542. You won't say that ",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",64
"65","—No.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",65
"66","11543. The Chairman.—Have you had any experience of the population in manufacturing towns ",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",66
"67","—I have not. I have had no practice in cities or towns.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",67
"68","11544. Do you think as many children are reared in proportion to the births here as in the Lowlands or in towns ",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",68
"69","—Yes; I think so.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",69
"70","11545. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—And come to maturity .",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",70
"71","—And come to maturity. The difference in their looks can be accounted for more on the ground of their food.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",71
"72","11546. The Chairman.—Do you think it is owing at all to the smoky atmosphere of the cottages ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",72
"73","—I don't think it is owing to that.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",73
"74","11547. Sheriff Nicolson.—In the greater part of Skye women are subject to a great deal of laborious work unsuitable to them, of which they complain in many places as being positively one of their grievances. Are the",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",74
"75","women here also subjected to that laborious kind of work",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",75
"76","—Yes, they are subjected to considerable labour.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",76
"77","11548. Carrying creels on their back?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",77
"78","—Yes, loading carts, drawing barrows, and carrying sea-ware.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",78
"79","11549. Most of the people have horses here?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",79
"80","—Yes, too many horses, I think, in proportion to the rest of their stock.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",80
"81","11550. Do they harrow with the hand?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",81
"82","—I have not seen much of that in this country, but they dig with the hand. They prefer to grow their potatoes in lazy beds. They believe the potatoes flourish best in that way.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",82
"83","11551. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—Is it not because the land is too wet to work with the plough ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",83
"84","—It may be so.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",84
"85","11552. Sheriff Nicolson.—Do yon think any of the women actually suffer in their constitution through the hard labour to which they are subjected?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",85
"86","— I have no doubt they do.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",86
"87","11553. I suppose you have known instances of its affecting them very injuriously?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",87
"88","—Yes, I have known instances.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",88
"89","11554. The Chairman.—Do you think that the labour of the women is in any degree imposed upon them by idleness on the part of the men, or do you think it is entirely in the nature of things ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",89
"90","—It is in the nature of things. They are obliged to labour.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",90
"91","11555. Mr Cameron.—How do they manage to look after their children when they are working?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",91
"92","—They are under the charge of perhaps an older girl or boy, or perhaps the grandmother.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",92
"93","11556. Do the women do much labour up to near the time of their confinement?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",93
"94","—I should say so.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",94
"95","11557. Too near?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",95
"96","—I have never known any mishap occur on that account among them.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",96
"97","11558. How long do they remain at home after that?—They generally do little house work for fourteen days or so. ",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",97
"98","11559. For fourteen days they do nothing?—I believe they do, in some cases. ",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",98
"99","11560. You don't think they work too hard, either just before or after their confinement?—I don't think they do. ",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",99
"100","11561. Are there many illegitimate births here ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",100
"101","—Very few ; not more than 2 per cent.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",101
"102","11562. Do you think less than in other parts of the Highlands?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",102
"103","—I think so.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",103
"104","11563. To what do you attribute that?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",104
"105","—They marry very young here, and the men are very chaste; probably their church has to do with that.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",105
"106","11564. Do you think it belongs more to the religion of the people here to discourage illegitimacy or bad behaviour in that respect ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",106
"107","—I believe so.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",107
"108","11565. Are you a Roman Catholic yourself?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",108
"109","—No.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",109
"110","11566. What happens in your experience to these men and women who marry early ? What do they do when they marry ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",110
"111","—They either live in the house in which they marry, or they squat outside somewhere.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",111
"112","11567. Which do they do generally—live in the house with their parents or squat outside ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",112
"113","—I suppose they live with the parents.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",113
"114","11568. If they squat outside, do they build houses?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",114
"115","—They do.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",115
"116","11569. Do they obtain the consent of the proprietor or factor before squatting?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",116
"117","—I am not quite sure of that, but I presume they do.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",117
"118","11570. You are not aware there is any rule on the estate against it?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",118
"119","—I am not aware.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",119
"120","11571. Which do you consider the most injurious—the two families living in one house, or one family leaving it and squatting outside ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",120
"121","—The latter, I think.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",121
"122","11572. You would rather they lived in the one house?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",122
"123","—I would rather they all lived in one house. A young husband and wife are very often associated with either parent who is getting old, and who would much prefer that they should have their hereditary descendants in the croft rather than squatting outside. ",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",123
"124","11573. But you see no inconvenience from two families in one of these small houses ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",124
"125","—Most certainly it is inconvenient.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",125
"126","11574. How many rooms do they consist of?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",126
"127","—Most of them have three rooms.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",127
"128","11575. Of equal size, or two rooms and a closet?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",128
"129","—There is a sleeping place set apart, and a middle place which is used as a kitchen, and another end which is generally occupied by their cattle.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",129
"130","11576. Then two families don't use the same sleeping place?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",130
"131","—I believe they do in many cases.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",131
"132","11577. How many people have you known sleeping in one room of all sorts and sexes ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",132
"133","—Of one family I have seen eight sick in one room, lying in fever.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",133
"134","11578. You mean you have been attending them?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",134
"135","—Yes, the whole family.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",135
"136","11579. And, in health, how many have you known to be commonly occupying one room ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",136
"137","—As many as seven or eight people.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",137
"138","11580. Of all sorts and ages?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",138
"139","—All sorts and ages.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",139
"140","11581. And both sexes ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",140
"141","—Both sexes.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",141
"142","11582. Do you attribute much of the poverty we have heard of in this island to the difficulty of disposing of these younger branches of the family when they marry—their remaining in the house or squatting?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",142
"143","—Most certainly.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",143
"144","11583. Marrying young, and not leaving the country ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",144
"145","—Yes, I do. No doubt, the poverty is owing to over-population.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",145
"146","11584. Have you had any conversation with these people as to whether they would like to emigrate, or whether they would prefer living on the croft where they were born ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",146
"147","—They would much prefer to remain at home.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",147
"148","11585. Have you ever urged on them the advantages of seeking their fortune abroad?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",148
"149","—I have certainly mentioned it to many.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",149
"150","11586. But they don't seem to do so?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",150
"151","—They prefer to remain at home, and they would very much wish to increase their holdings by sharing in",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",151
"152","some of the tacks in the country. That is the general opinion, so far as I can glean.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",152
"153","11587. As there must be obvious difficulties in the way of doing that all at once, does it never occur to them to go and seek their fortunes elsewhere? They would prefer to remain as they are ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",153
"154","—Yes, but I have no doubt, if they received assistance, and entire families were taken out, many would take advantage of it and emigrate.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",154
"155","11588. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—You think, if Government adopted a good scheme of emigration, it would be of advantage to this country ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",155
"156","— As an alternative scheme.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",156
"157","11589. And the people would like it?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",157
"158","—I think some of them would.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",158
"159","11590. The people here build their own houses ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",159
"160","—They do.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",160
"161","11591. You say they are not nearly so good as the houses in Mull. Do the people of Mull build their own houses ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",161
"162","—They do.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",162
"163","11592. If the people had leases here, do you think they would be encouraged to improve their buildings, and have as good houses as those in Mull?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",163
"164","—They often say so, and they give it as a reason for being so backward that they have no pleasure in improving their houses and surroundings when they have no security of holding the land.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",164
"165","11593. Have you any idea what security the people in Mull have?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",165
"166","—They have no security, but I don't suppose if they pay their rent they will be disturbed.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",166
"167","11594. They have no promise of compensation if they are disturbed?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",167
"168","—No promise.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",168
"169","11595. You say there is a good deal of consumption in the spring of the year from over-working and under-feeding. Do you think, if it were not that the people are under-fed, they are over-worked ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",169
"170","—Not at all. I don't think they are over-worked if they were properly fed. I have hardly seen any cases among tacksmen or their servants, because they are well clothed, well fed, and well housed.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",170
"171","11596. In books written about this country one hundred years ago, you will see it stated that from poverty the people suffered every spring from a very great deal of fever. Is that the case now ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",171
"172","—Yes, it is typhus fever which is the disease of the poor, and it is associated with under-feeding.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",172
"173","11597. It also arises from bad drainage",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",173
"174","—Yes, and over-crowding.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",174
"175","11598. But particularly under-feeding?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",175
"176","—Under-feeding, with the other conditions of house accommodation.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",176
"177","11599. You stated that the people here have as much stock as the people in Mull. In what respect are they placed in an inferior position as compared with the people of Mull ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",177
"178","—As regards their houses.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",178
"179","11600. But as regards their earnings, the people of Mull are able to feed better than people here. They have no fever ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",179
"180","—They have no fever now. They have better houses, and probably they are better fed.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",180
"181","11601. Why are they better fed, if they have less stock?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",181
"182","—I say they have less stock in proportion to the rent they pay.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",182
"183","11602. The people here don't pay a high rent for their stock, but they have not enough of it",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",183
"184","—They have not enough of it.",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",184
"185","11603. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh,.—With regard to crofters crowding and young people marrying, suppose a man has a croft and has six of a family—three sons and three daughters. The eldest son probably will succeed to the croft, but what becomes of the other two sons and three daughters ? Don't the daughters generally go out to service unless they get married ?",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",185
"186","—Yes. ",196,"Donald Black","South Uist, Lochboisdale",186
