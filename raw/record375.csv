"7","22561. Do you remember the paper which Messrs Garriock & Co sent round ten years ago ?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",7
"8","—No, I don't",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",8
"9","—[James Gray]. It was stated then that the Foula men were dissatisfied with the price they were receiving for the green fish. Then they had the chance of salting their fish and drying them, only they had to meet the expenses, pay rent, and buy their own meal. The factor would not supply them ; and there were many years that the fishing of Foula turned out to be little or nothing, and if it had not been for Messrs Garriock & Co. we should not have been alive; and we are afraid that might turn out again, and what would we do then ? We could not live at all.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",9
"10","21562. You think it better that they should have the whole of the fish ?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",10
"11","—Yes, because when they had the fish, whether we had a fishing or not, they gave us what supply we needed, until we could pay.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",11
"12","21563. And you are still of the same mind?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",12

"16","—[James Gray]. I have the dearest rent in the island, £5. I have been in the place twenty-six or twenty-eight years, and there has only been one year out of that that I could bread my family without buying.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",16
"17","21565. You mean there was only one year in which there was enough on the croft to supply your family ?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",17

"19","21566. How much have you had to buy in other years?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",19

"21","—[Another Islander]. I have paid £10.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",21
"22","21567. What will a fisherman make here in a year?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",22

"24","—[Mr Inkster]. Their earnings will range from £ 8 to £15, taking both fishings together.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",24

"36","—That year I did have a little, but very little. My rent is heavy, and in addition to that I have to buy bread and meal, and there is nothing to meet that, and a poor man cannot stand that.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",36
"37","21572. Professor Mackinnon.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",37

"67","—Yes.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",67
"68","21587. What is the reason of the difference between the dates of settlement here and on the mainland, is it because the boat cannot come here in November?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",68
"69","—Yes.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",69
"70","21588. It suits you quite as well to have a settlement just now?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",70
"71","—Yes.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",71
"72","21589. Is it the rent due at last November, or November coming, which is collected just now?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",72

"129","21616. Are you engaged in the herring fishing just now?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",129
"130","—No, in the ling fishing. I have never gone to the herring fishing.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",130
"131","21617. You have never gone in for the herring fishing here?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",131

"133","21618. Was it never tried before?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",133
"134","—Only on a very small scale—two nets set across the mouth of the goe.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",134
"135","—[John Hendry]. Our greatest concern is the land rent. There was one year there were three of us in a family, and we laboured very hard, and we only made what would keep us alive for three months. I had then to go across to Raewick to Mr Garriock and was indebted to him for eight or nine months' living. My rent was £4, 10s. and I had between £10 and £11 for meal to answer for, making in all £16, while my fishing was only worth about £5 or £6; and that launched me into debt I have not got out of yet, and that is the general. case. We look upon Mr Garriock as a very merciful man, but we are very apt to grumble that his things are too dear. We are paying 5s. 11d. for a pound of English tobacco, and we think that rather dear.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",135

"138","21620. Is it very good tea?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",138
"139","—The tea at 3s. 4d. per lb. is the best.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",139
"140","21621. What do you pay for sugar?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",140

"142","21622. Professor Mackinnon.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",142

"151","—Yes.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",151
"152","21626. I suppose you eat very much the same as your fathers did?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",152
"153","—Yes.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",153
"154","21627. What have you to breakfast?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",154
"155","—In winter bread and milk when we have it, and sometimes we have a little black bread, and a cup of tea. That is the general rule I think. Fish and potatoes for dinner; but they are not potatoes; you could wring the water out of them.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",155
"156","21628. You very seldom taste meat?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",156

"161","21630. But those that don't you eat?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",161
"162","—Yes.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",162
"163","21631. Sheriff Nicolson.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",163
"164","—Do you keep any pigs?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",164
"165","—There are no pigs on the island. We are not fit to feed them.",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",165
"166","21632. Would not the fish offal feed them ?",375,"David Henry, James Gray, Robert Paterson, John Henry","Shetland, Foula",166
