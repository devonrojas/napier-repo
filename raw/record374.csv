"1","GEORGE MORRISON, Pastor of the Congregational Church (26)â€”examined.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",1
"2","21513. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",2
"3","â€”How long have you been here?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",3
"4","â€”Two years.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",4
"5","21514. Are you a native of Shetland?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",5
"6","â€”No, I am a native of Wick.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",6
"7","21515. You were in the chair at a meeting of which Mr Gear has spoken?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",7
"8","â€”Yes.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",8
"9","21516. And you were asked to prepare the memorial which has been submitted?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",9
"10","â€”Yes.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",10
"11","21517. That memorial was read at a second meeting, paragraph by paragraph, and was approved of?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",11
"12","â€”Yes.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",12
"13","21518. There is one paragraph which you have heard referred to, which was not discussed?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",13
"14","â€”Mr Gear said so, but the statement was incorrect; every line was discussed and accepted.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",14
"15","21519. It may have been accepted without being discussed?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",15
"16","â€”It was really discussed; Mr Gear himself discussed it; and his opinion upon the question of the monopoly does not agree with the opinion of the crofters.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",16
"17","21520. Your memorial says, ' We crofters would still be placed at a disadvantage, our circumstances compelling us to sell in the cheapest and buy in the dearest market,' you think that is an irremediable disadvantage?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",17
"18","â€”I think so, because there must be freight both on goods imported and exported, owing to our situation.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",18
"19","21521. Would it be desirable to have an open market, or that Messrs Garriock should have the trade?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",19
"20","â€”I think it desirable that some merchant should have the market, because we cannot depend on other persons supplying us all the year round. Messrs Garriock supply us well; it is their own advantage to do so.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",20
"21","21522. And that is the opinion of the people of Foula to-day as it was ten years ago?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",21
"22","â€”I think so.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",22
"23","21523. Mr Cameron.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",23
"24","â€”When there was any difference of opinion in the meeting did you proceed to take a vote on the subject?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",24
"25","â€”There never was any difference except when Mr Gear differed from all the rest on some points; they were all unanimous.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",25
"26","21524. And they were unanimous as to the merchants' shop as well as the rest?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",26
"27","â€”Most unanimous.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",27
"28","21525. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",28
"29","â€”There used to be a monopoly of a similar kind on Fair Island, but by the establishment of more frequent communication that was done away with; you don't think that should be done here?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",29
"30","â€”It is hardly fair to say there is a monopoly here, because a few months ago there was a trading vessel lying here selling goods and buying produce.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",30
"31","21526. Not fish though?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",31
"32","â€”No, not fish.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",32
"33","21527. Unless the whole of the fish were sold to Messrs Garriock, they would not take a part of them?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",33
"34","â€”I don't think so, but I cannot speak positively to that. The men are not bound to fish to them; there are twelve men belonging to the island away at the herring fishing at Walls.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",34
"35","21528. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",35
"36","â€”But any fish caught at Foula must be sold to Messrs Garriock?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",36
"37","â€”They are sold to them as a matter of fact; I don't know if there is any binding agreement.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",37
"38","21529. You think yourself that the people of Foula like the monopoly to be in the hands of Messrs Garriock; is it for the benefit of the people of Foula that Messrs Garriock carry on business, or for their own profit?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",38
"39","â€”Their own profit.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",39
"40","21530. Is it possible for the benefit to be mutual?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",40
"41","â€”No doubt, Messrs Garriock's idea is to have it for their own benefit.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",41
"42","21531. You are not a free trader?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",42
"43","â€”I am.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",43
"44","21532. Are you not aware that to have a monopoly of this kind is contrary to free trade?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",44
"45","â€”I am; but I object to the word monopoly being applied to the trade here.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",45
"46","21533. Is it not the case that no other merchant can settle here?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",46
"47","â€”I think so; I think it has never been tried.. But Messrs Garriock & Co. are not the factors, it is Mr James Garriock.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",47
"48","21534. Is it not a fact that the proprietor prohibits any other person from carrying on business?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",48
"49","â€”I don't know that.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",49
"50","21535. If that were true would it alter your opinion?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",50
"51","â€”Yes, decidedly, if the people were bound to go to Messrs Garriock for their goods. They go there for the greater part of their goods, but they are not bound to do it. For my own part, I got part of my goods from Leith.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",51
"52","21536. But could any other merchant come and settle here and carry on business?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",52
"53","â€”I don't know; I cannot speak on that point.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",53
"54","21537. Don't you know quite well he could not?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",54
"55","â€”No; I don't suppose any other merchant would care to make the experiment, because forty ",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",55
"56","families would scarcely support another merchant.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",56
"57","21538. You are not a delegate ?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",57
"58","â€”No, I was simply chairman at the crofters meeting.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",58
"59","21539. Professor Mackinnon.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",59
"60","â€”I understand you to say that in theory you are quite as good a free trader as Mr Gear, but that your belief is that from the circumstances of this island the present arrangement is practically as good as any other that could be adopted?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",60
"61","â€”My opinion is, that we are safer under the present arrangement, because it is not likely two merchants would keep a shop here, and we might be left for two or three months without any at all.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",61
"62","21540. If you were informed that open trade had materially benefited the people of Fair Isle and improved the trade of the place, would that induce you to change your opinion?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",62
"63","â€”I think there is perhaps a difference between the circumstances of the people of Fair Isle and the people of Foula. The Fair islanders, if I know anything of their state, were much more oppressed under old arrangements than the Foula people; the landlord was more exacting and grasping.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",63
"64","21511. Do you think merchants coming here voluntarily would not be likely to supply the people better than at present?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",64
"65","â€”Not permanently, because whoever comes here must purchase fish and hosiery if he is to supply the people with goods, and hosiery is often a drug in the market for a long time, and the price is very low. The Orkney merchant who was here a short time ago, paid lower prices for hosiery than Messrs Garriock & Co. were doing.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",65
"66","21512. Might not your free trade principles incline you to try the experiment of a shop?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",66
"67","â€”No.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",67
"68","21513. In your case, practice overcomes theory?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",68
"69","â€”I am not inclined to make so heavy a sacrifice for principle.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",69
"70","21514. Sheriff Nicolson.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",70
"71","â€”You are the only minister on the island?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",71
"72","â€”I am the representative of the Congregational Union; I am not an ordained minister.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",72
"73","21515. But you are the only resident minister on the island?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",73
"74","â€”No, Mr Gear is the representative of the Church of Scotland.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",74
"75","21516. To which denomination do most of the inhabitants belong?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",75
"76","â€”To the Congregational Church.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",76
"77","21517. Do all the inhabitants come to your services without distinction of sect?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",77
"78","â€”The greater number of them come occasionally. The number connected with the Church of Scotland is a mere handful; about a dozen, I suppose.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",78
"79","21518. There is no sectarian feeling?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",79
"80","â€”None.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",80
"81","21519. Do they attend the church very regularly?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",81
"82","â€”Very regularly.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",82
"83","21550. And they are very particular in keeping the Sabbath?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",83
"84","â€”Yes, but not in the same way as in the west of Scotland; they are not such strict Sabbatarians as the people of the Hebrides.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",84
"85","21551. They don't consider it a sin to walk about on the Sabbath and admire the beauties of nature?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",85
"86","â€”No, we are not so straight-laced as the Hebrideans.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",86
"87","21552. Do they indulge in song singing?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",87
"88","â€”They don't indulge very much in song singing.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",88
"89","21553. Have you any music amongst you?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",89
"90","â€”Yes, the inhabitants of Foula are very musical.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",90
"91","21551. What form does it take?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",91
"92","â€”Principally, the form of sacred music.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",92
"93","21555. Have they any instrumental music?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",93
"94","â€”-Yes, Mr Paterson has an instrument and I have another.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",94
"95","21556. What sort of an instrument?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",95
"96","â€”A harmonium. ",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",96
"97","21557. Is the old practice of fowling entirely given up?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",97
"98","â€”Yes, I think",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",98
"99","21558. How long since?",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",99
"100","â€”I think a long time ago.",374,"George Morrison ","Shetland, Foula",100
