"11","The Grievances of Galtrigill Crofters, one township of Dr Martins Estate. To the Royal Commissioners of the Highlands and Islands of  Scotland.",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",11
"12","—When Malcolm Nicolson, Esq., the proprietor before the present one, got this estate, he raised our rents before he took the arable land and hill pasture from us. He cut the small patches left for us in crofts. Some of the people had to leave for the want of land. When the land was in the crofters possession they had four milk cows, and three or four barren beasts on the hill, two horses, and from thirty to fifty sheep. When they were deprived of that by Mr Nicolson they were allowed to keep three cows and six sheep, each crofter on Borroraig hill pasture, as he put Galtrigill and Borroraig on one hill pasture. They were not allowed to keep horses any further. Our present proprietor, Dr Martin, allowed us to keep three cows, no sheep, no horses; and the six sheep allowed us by Mr Nicolson, we had to put them away three years after he got this estate. Up to forty years we had no sheep. He took from us three times part of the hill pasture left us by Mr Nicolson, and added to his own sheep farm. AH the hill pasture left for Galtrigill crofters was 100 yards broad and one fourth of a mile in length. No reduction of rent has been given, but raised our rents. Some of the crofters, their rents were raised since fifteen years, some others their rents were raised since eight years. Also we were forced to work ten days a year—a man or woman from each croft—such as planting potatoes, shearing corn, drying and shipping fish, and landing salt, for nothing; and if we would not attend to all the aforesaid labours, we would be in danger of eviction. Also we had to buy hooks from him to shear his own corn, and pay for them ; and if we would not attend this labour, we would be charged 2s. 6d. a day; and if we would get work from him for payment, it is Is. and Is. 6d. a day we would get. The produce of our holdings would not maintain our families one-third of the year. We are always under the necessity of buying. Our desire is plenty of land for a fair rent, or, in other words, what would make us comfortable ; the summering of six cows, from thirty to fifty sheep, and one horse; compensation for improvement; fixity of tenure. Some of us have two cows, very few have three cows; and we are so deep in debt to our creditors that we cannot say that they are our own. Some of us will be upwards of £ 20 in meal yearly, some others a little less; also we have to buy wool for day clothing and night clothing, which will come to a number of pounds; and therefore our earnest desire is that our circumstances would be considered by the Government. Also there is twelve families on ten lots, of which three of them are subdivided. Our rent is from £4, 5s. to £8. Also there are other four crofters in Sheader in the vicinity of Galtrigill, on Dr Martins estate. Their grievances are similar to ours. Their rent is from £3, 5s. to £5. The produce of their crofts will not maintain them the third part of the year. They are always under the necessity of buying. They will be upwards of £ 20 yearly in meal. Their desire is plenty of land, six cows, from thirty to fifty sheep, one horse, compensation for improvement, fixity of tenure.",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",12
"13","All the aforementioned grievances are true, and will be signed by the crofters.—",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",13

"46","—Yes, but there were some years we were getting on better than others; the years of fishing on the east coast went well with us.",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",46
"47","7384. If you got back that part of the hill winch was originally yours, would that satisfy you ?",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",47

"89","—We would wish to have a fixed holding in our present lots for a home. Our old people would wish that. A man who has been paying rent for fifty years would not like to leave the place in his old age.",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",89

"98","—That is a very hard question for me to answer.",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",98
"99","7408. The Chairman.",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",99
"100","—How many years have you been paying rent along with your father ?",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",100

"110","7413. Was it exacted in the last year ?",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",110
"111","—No.",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",111
"112","7414. Then your rent last year was the same that it was thirty years ago ?",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",112
"113","—No, that £ 1 of rise in our rents we have been paying for the past seven years.",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",113
"114","7415. Did you pay your rent last year ?",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",114
"115","—No.",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",115
"116","7416. Do you know of any one who paid his rent in your township ?",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",116
"117","—No.",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",117
"118","7417. Have you heard that other parties elsewhere have had that £1 reduced ?",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",118

"120","7418. Do you remember in these thirty years any one who has been evicted on Dr Martins estate who has paid his rent ?",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",120
"121","—I dont know of any being removed except two who went to Waternish, and I dont know whether they were in arrear or not.",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",121
"122","7419. Have you ever heard it reported here that any one has been molested or had his property or his implements injured in consequence of not taking the part of the people in the public agitation ?",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",122

"124","7420. Have you ever molested anybody yourself on that account ?",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",124

"126","7421. Did you on any occasion stop a cart which belonged to Dr Martin and search his cart ?",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",126
"127","—We stopped a cart, but did not search it.",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",127
"128","7422. What was the object in stopping it ?",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",128
"129","—There were a great number of us people on the public road at the time the warnings were coming. Dr Martins carter was going to Galtrigill with meal for the shepherd, and we asked him to take it easy till he should get through the crowd, and when he heard that he stood up in the cart and took a bite of the reins, and commenced to lash the horse through the people; and when we saw that, and the women and the children in danger, we took hold of the horses reins until the people got cleared off the road. That is all I saw done to any person.",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",129
"130","7423. You did not injure anything ?",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",130
"131","—No, we did not touch man or beast.",138,"Donald Mclean","Skye, Glendale",131
