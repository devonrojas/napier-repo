"1","JOHN MACKAY, Crofter, Kilphedar (75)—examined.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",1
"2","11088. The Chairman.—Have you a paper to submit to the Commission ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",2
"3","—Yes. ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",3
"4","The following is an exact statement of part of the grievances and hardbhps of us, the crofters of Kilphedar. We have suffered much injustice during upwards of the last forty years through having been deprived of a great extent of hill pasturage by Dr M'Leod, the then factor of Colonel Gordon, for which he promised us compensation, meaning a reduction of our rent. At the following Whitsunday he was expelled from the office of factorship without fulfilling his promise. We claimed the compensation from the succeeding factor, but was refused, saying that he would not make any alteration in the books, but leave them in the same way in which he found them. We claimed the compensation from every succeeding factor, with the same result. There",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",4
"5","are over forty crofters and cottars located on the land, deprived from us as above mentioned upwards of forty years ago, while we pay the same rent yet, without any reduction whatever. There were twenty-three crofts in this township at first; the rent was raised on account of the ware being growing at both ends of our land suitable for making kelp; but kelp making has ceased, by which we paid our rent, but the rent remains as it was formerly. We have suffered many injustices while we were making the kelp, viz., we were every third year, for ten years, compelled to leave our own kelp stance to others who were destroying our grass and corn, while we had to go to tacksmen's lands to make kelp; after being there all summer the case generally was that we would not make as much kelp as would pay the grazing of our horses, while nothing was allowed to ourselves for any loss we sustained through those who were making kelp on our own lands. We were not allowed to keep a dog, though we would pay licence for it. Our sheep were chased and gathered to a certain place called a fault by the ground officer, constables, and other helpers, through the order of the factor, in order to see if any crofter had more than ten sheep, which was the number allowed for us to keep however high the rent of the croft might be; if it happened that any person had more than the above number he was obliged to buy grazing from a neighbour short of the above number; the reason for that was, and still is, that we were deprived of our former hill pasturage, which we claim and trust to get possession of yet. Ground officer and constables used to come two or three days before the market's day to our houses, marking our stock which was ready for the market, compelling us to drive them to the factor's house, so as to avoid us the freedom of selling them at the market ourselves. We were obliged to make potato parks to the proprietrix on our rented land; which we cultivated from mere wild moor with crooked and common spades, carrying the whole of the manure on our backs where horses could not walk, that being done without any abatement of rent. These parks are fenced, the grazing of which is let to the highest bidder. Our peats stance has been taken from us to make room for crofters and cottars, where they have a miserable living. If we complain of being overcrowded, the factor's answer is, "" There is no room for the people in the country."" Yes, there is plenty for twice or thrice as many, from where others were driven and compelled to emigrate to America; some of whom had been tied before our eyes, others hiding themselves in caves and crevices for fear of being",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",5
"6","caught by authorised officers. There is twice or thrice as much waste arable land in South Uist as there is under cultivation. Our land is so inferior in quality that it will not yield one-eighth part of a year's allowance for our families. We are thus under the necessity of buying from Glasgow seven-eighths of a year's allowance of our victuals, and that of the most inferior quality, such as Indian meal, and the cheapest groceries; also our clothing, for want of sheep and competent holding. As there is plenty of arable land in the country not used or cultivated, we want as much of it (both of arable and hill pasturage) as will support our families comfortably, and that at a reasonable rent, with security that we shall not be removed from our holdings as long as we can pay rent for it. We never appealed to Lady Cathcart for the above grievances, but repeatedly to her representatives, without any result.' ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",6
"7","11089. How many crofters and cottars are living on the township of Kilphedar?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",7
"8","—Forty-two families.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",8
"9","11090. Professor Mackinnon.—Are they all paying rent to the proprietor?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",9
"10","—They are all paying rent.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",10
"11","11091. The Chairman —Is there any hill pasture?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",11
"12","—No.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",12
"13","11092. No hill pasture at all ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",13
"14","—None now.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",14
"15","11093. How long is it since the hill pasture was taken away?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",15
"16","—Thirtyeight years ago.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",16
"17","11094. What has become of it? Whom was it given to?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",17
"18","—It belongs to the crofters of North Loch Boisdale here.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",18
"19","11095. Have you got a whole croft, or part of a croft ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",19
"20","—A whole croft.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",20
"21","11096. About what acreage is it?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",21
"22","—I have no knowledge of acres at all.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",22
"23","11097. Then what is the stock you keep ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",23
"24","—I have three cows, one twoyear-old, three stirks, one horse, four sheep, one pig.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",24
"25","11098. What is your rent?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",25
"26","—£10, 7s.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",26
"27","11099. Has that rent been increased since you got the croft?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",27
"28","—No, not increased.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",28
"29","11100. Are the other crofters in the township much in the same position as you are ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",29
"30","—In the same way.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",30
"31","11101. If you could get hill pasture, would you be satisfied ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",31
"32","—If we get what was taken from us. Our peat banks were taken from us, and other parks that have been especially enclosed by the proprietrix have also been taken from us, and we have no common grazing.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",32
"33","11102. But have you got other grazing equally as good?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",33
"34","—I can only answer for myself. I would be satisfied if I got an equal portion of land elsewhere, but I would prefer to get what belonged to us originally.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",34
"35","11103. Is there any land belonging to some tack which could be given to vou for hill pasture?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",35
"36","—No land lying suitably adjacent to our present holding.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",36
"37","11104. Do you take any grazing from tacksmen, or do you keep this stock upon your own crofts?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",37
"38","—Perhaps a very few of them may for a few days obtain grazing from the tacksmen in order to put their cattle into a condition for market.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",38
"39","11105. Do they pay the tacksman in labour or pay him in money?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",39
"40","—We give days of labour—making hay stacks in harvest time. He is not very hard upon us.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",40
"41","11106. You are an old man. Do you think the people were much better off in their clothing and food in your young days than they are now, or are they as well off now ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",41
"42","—We were very much better off in food and clothing when I was young. When I was a young man, I would complain very much of the food I take to-day.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",42
"43","11107. Sheriff Nicolson.—What is the difference between the food you had in your youth and the food you have now ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",43
"44","—We had butter, cheese, flesh, potatoes, and meal, of which we cannot to-day partake, and plenty of them, of which to-day there is very little. ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",44
"45","11108. What is your ordinary food now ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",45
"46","—I am almost ashamed to tell you. We have tea and eggs, and sometimes not sufficient milk to put into our tea, and sometimes not sufficient sugar. ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",46
"47","11109. Have you not plenty of bread?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",47
"48","—I will tell the truth. I have a little bread, but only a little. If I would take the advice of the ground officer, I would not have even that little food to-day.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",48
"49","11110. What is the advice of the ground officer?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",49
"50","—The ground officer told me that if he had known I had applied to the local factor for seed corn, he would have prevented me getting it, because I trespassed in ploughing some bit of land beyond the orders of the ground officer. ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",50
"51","11111. Have you ceased to make kelp here ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",51
"52","—Yes.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",52
"53","11112. How long since ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",53
"54","—About five years ago.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",54
"55","11113. What are you getting for it ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",55
"56","—No value.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",56
"57","11114. You made a great deal of money by it when you were young?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",57
"58","— Yes. I could make four or five tons of kelp myself, for which I would get from £2 to £2, 10s. a ton. That kept me from getting into arrears, and also helped me to buy food, but now that source of income has gone.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",58
"59","11115. I have heard in some other islands that the people are less cheerful and jovial than they used to be long ago. Is there any difference in that respect here ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",59
"60","—They are not quite so foolish now-a-days as they were when I was young. The struggle for existence is too strong for them now.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",60
"61","11116. Then there is not much gaiety in their life ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",61
"62","—No.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",62
"63","11117. But they have not given up singing songs, I hope?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",63
"64","—Oh no, they have not given up songs.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",64
"65","11118. And they have not given up piping ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",65
"66","—No.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",66
"67","11119. I suppose the ministers in South Uist are not against these things ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",67
"68","—I do not think the Free Church clergyman near me is caring much about music or dancing or songs. He is an exception. I never heard any of my own priests object, if we behaved ourselves about it.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",68
"69","11120. And the parish minister?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",69
"70","—No, I never heard that the parish minister objected to anything of the kind, and I don't know whether he is",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",70
"71","or is not present here to-day, but he is a good friend to the country. ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",71
"72","11121. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—You say there are forty-two crofters now on Kilphedar?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",72
"73","—Yes. ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",73
"74","11122. You also state in this paper that there were originally only twenty-three crofters ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",74
"75","—Yes.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",75
"76","11123. How did that increase come—Was it from the natural increase among the people themselves, or were there any outsiders placed among them?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",76
"77","—Partly natural increase, and partly some of those that were dispossessed of the lands at Frobost, as already spoken of.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",77
"78","11124. Can you mention the numbers ? Of the increase of nineteen, how many were from Frobost ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",78
"79","—Nine.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",79
"80","11125. Could you pay your rents easily, or be in pretty good circumstances, if you had the hill ground as you originally had, and for the same rent ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",80
"81","—Yes.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",81
"82","11126. I want to ask you about peats. It seems to be a great grievance that there are cottars placed among your peats. Is the result of that, that you have to go further away, or that the peats are getting scarcer ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",82
"83","—The cottars spoil our peat moss.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",83
"84","11127. What do you mean by spoiling it?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",84
"85","—They converted it into arable land, where we used to cut our peats.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",85
"86","11128. And you had to go elsewhere?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",86
"87","—Yes.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",87
"88","11129. There is a grievance about parks? Do I understand that the people of Kilphedar reclaimed certain lands and enclosed them with walls, which are now in the possession of the landlord ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",88
"89","—Yes.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",89
"90","11130. Is that let from year to year, or in whose hands are those parks ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",90
"91","—They are valued, and that value is paid by those who are able to pay for it in the township.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",91
"92","11131. Do I understand you to say that besides the reclamation you built the dykes at your own cost ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",92
"93","—No, we were paid for reclaiming it.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",93
"94","11132. What did you get?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",94
"95","—We were receiving 14s. for reclaiming a space that was containing a barrel of seed potatoes.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",95
"96","11133. And you got that ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",96
"97","—Yes.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",97
"98","11134. You mention a grievance that the ground officer was in the habit of ordering them to drive in their cattle for the purpose of taking them out for sale, and giving his own price ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",98
"99","—It is two years since it ceased. ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",99
"100","11135. Did the ground officer, or whoever went about in this way, name his own price to the people?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",100
"101","—No, they were valued on the home farm at Askernish afterwards. The animals were carried away, and afterwards valued on the farm of Askernish ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",101
"102","11136. Whatever price was fixed upon had you a voice in the fixing of the price ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",102
"103","—Some were marked by the proprietor, but left in the possession of the original holders, who went afterwards to market with them, and got better prices than for those that were delivered over and valued.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",103
"104","11137. Then it was no advantage to the crofter tenantry that these animals were taken from them ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",104
"105","—If we got good value, it mattered not to us.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",105
"106","11138. The beast was taken off to the home farm of Askernish, and there priced. Had you any voice in the pricing of the animal at Askernish?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",106
"107","—Two tacksmen—Mr M'Leod and Mr Ferguson—were the valuators.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",107
"108","11139. Did the tenants and the crofters generally complain of this system, which has now been happily done away with ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",108
"109","—Yes, they did complain.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",109
"110","11140. Was it in consequence of their complaints that Mr Macdonald ordered it to be given up ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",110
"111","—Mr Macdonald did nothing wrong to us since he became factor over us but what was wrong before. He merely followed out the old customs.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",111
"112","11141. I mentioned Mr Macdonald's name because I presume he was the person who gave orders to stop the system ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",112
"113","—I believe that is right. ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",113
"114","11142. You make a very serious charge in this paper which requires a little explanation. You say—' Others were driven and compelled to emigrate to America, some of whom had been tied before our eyes, others hiding themselves in caves and crevices, for fear of being caught by authorised officers,' will you explain those words ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",114
"115","—I heard and saw portions of it.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",115
"116","11143. Will you relate what you heard and saw?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",116
"117","—I saw a policeman chasing a man down the macher towards Askernish, with a view to catch him, in order to send him on board an emigrant ship lying in Loch Boisdale. I saw a man who lay down on his face and nose on a little island, hiding himself from the policeman, and the policeman getting a dog to search for this missing man in order to get him on board the emigrant ship.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",117
"118","11144. What was the name of the man ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",118
"119","—Lachlan Macdonald.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",119
"120","11145. What was the name of the previous person you referred to?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",120
"121","—Donald Smith.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",121
"122","11146. Did the dog find this unfortunate youth ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",122
"123","—The dog did not discover him, but the man was afterwards discovered all the same. He had got into the trench of a lazy bed.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",123
"124","11147. What was done with him ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",124
"125","—He was taken off.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",125
"126","11148. And really sent off like an animal that was going to the southern markets ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",126
"127","—Just the same way.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",127
"128","11149. Did you hear that the same thing was done to others, although you did not see it ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",128
"129","—A man named Angus Johnston, whose wife gave birth to three children, and another child was dead before, he was seized and tied upon the pier of Loch Boisdalc ; and it was by means of giving him a kick that he was put into the boat and knocked down. The old priest interfered, and said, ' What arc you doing to this man ? Let him alone. It is against the law.' The four children were dead in the house when he was caught and tied, and knocked down by a kick, and put on board. ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",129
"130","11150. Speaking generally, are you able to say from hearsay that you have no doubt in your own mind there were many other hardships and cruelties committed in the course of these evictions ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",130
"131","—Yes, no doubt. I myself had charge of a squad of men working on a road when Mr Chisholm and Murdoch M'Lennan wished me to go to Loch Eynort to bring people out of their homes to be sent out in an emigrant ship. ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",131
"132","11151. Who were these two people you named ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",132
"133","—Just tacksmen in the country, with the view of clearing the country for themselves.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",133
"134","11152. What did you say to that ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",134
"135","— The office does not belong to me. I am in charge of a squad of men working upon these roads, paid by the",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",135
"136","proprietor. I have nothing to do with searching houses or taking men out of them. If you have constables send them. They went away and sent other constables after that.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",136
"137","11153. The Chairman.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",137
"138","—You speak of a man who hid himself, and was discovered and taken by force on board. Did that man belong to a family which was going away ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",138
"139","—A brother also went away at the same time, and there is a nephew here to-day.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",139
"140","11154. What was the age of the man who was taken away?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",140
"141","—Over twenty years.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",141
"142","11155. Professor Mackinnon.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",142
"143","—Were his father and mother going that day ?—His father and mother were both dead at that time.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",143
"144","11156. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—Were they in the habit of sending away husbands without their wives? —No. I never heard any instance of that kind, unless a man voluntarily left his wife when they would disagree.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",144
"145","11157. But you understand that one man was put on board a vessel by force with four dead children in the house, where was the wife at that time ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",145
"146","—She followed him on board.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",146
"147","11158. Professor Mackinnon.—The dead children would be buried before that ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",147
"148","—The four dead bodies were buried before the mother went on board.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",148
"149","11159. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—I think you mentioned in Gaelic that that was a case you had heard of, but had not seen ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",149
"150","—No, I did not see it, but I knew both the husband and the wife. ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",150
"151","11160. How long is it since this happened ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",151
"152","—In 1850 or 1851.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",152
"153","11161. Who was the factor at that time?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",153
"154","—Mr Fleming; and this was the year the late Mr Birnie came to be factor.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",154
"155","11162. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—Was that the last forcible eviction which occurred on these estates? —Yes. Five emigrant ships left Loch Boisdale, and that was the last occasion of any forcible eviction between",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",155
"156","this and Barra.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",156
"157","11163. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—You complain that the proprietor took possession of part of your lands—the reclaimed lands. What is the extent of the reclaimed lands of which you have been deprived? —There are three parks, and two of them contain about thirty acres. I cannot tell the acreage of the third.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",157
"158","11164. Were they valuable grazing ground?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",158
"159","—Yes, they were cropping it.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",159
"160","11165. You get fair wages for the reclamations",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",160
"161","—We did receive payment as already stated. We would have been much better pleased if they had left the ground to ourselves.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",161
"162","11166. You got no reduction of rent?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",162
"163","—No. We don't complain of any of the present factors, they did not do the harm. They simply exact from us what former ones exacted.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",163
"164","11167 But this reclamation took place under the present factor, did it not?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",164
"165","—Yes, but I think it was against Mr Macdonald's wish that the late factor Mr Walker did make those parks in certain places. Mr Macdonald's intention was to reclaim land that had never before been cropped, and not ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",165
"166","to enclose land that was formerly cropped. ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",166

"168","11169. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",168

"171","—From Benbecula to Barra Head.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",171
"172","11170. I want to ask you this general question. Were the lands from which these people were sent away at that time given to the crofters in any part, or were they added to tacks, or made into new tacks ?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",172
"173","—Some of them at the south end were given to crofters by doubling the crofts. But most of the lands were added to the tacks of Askernish and Milton. Frobost, of which we have heard to-day already, was cleared, and added to a neighbouring tack, and also Kildonan. Twenty-seven families were evicted from Kildonan, and also about twenty-four families from Bornish. ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",173
"174","11171. And these were all added to the big farms?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",174

"176","11172. Are you on ground which formerly belonged to Clanranald ",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",176
"177","— Yes, the whole country there.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",177
"178","11173. Were there any removals in their times?",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",178
"179","—None but those who would voluntarily go.",191,"John Mackay","South Uist, Lochboisdale",179
