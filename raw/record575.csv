"88","34526. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",575,"Donald Beaton, Alexander Macfarlane","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",88
"89","—Although you suffered very much in those times, would you not have recovered your position and not now",575,"Donald Beaton, Alexander Macfarlane","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",89
"90","been a poor man were it not that your pasture was taken from you and your rent almost doubled ?",575,"Donald Beaton, Alexander Macfarlane","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",90
"91","—Yes, no doubt.",575,"Donald Beaton, Alexander Macfarlane","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",91
