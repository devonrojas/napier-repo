"5","15963. Will you make a statement on behalf of those whom you represent ?",290,"Farquhar Murray","Lewis, Ness",5
"6","—You already heard other delegates complain how the rent has been raised. Perhaps it should have been a matter of complaint in the first instance to the chamberlain, because he is a man who likes to see things put right. We have seen him put other things upon a proper footing when he found them amiss. That is all I have to say. There were some people who were removed in order to add to the land attached to the mill. I knew very little about it, and I declined to make the statement, but they sent it in in this writing. This is the statement:",290,"Farquhar Murray","Lewis, Ness",6
"7","—We the undersigned humbly beg to set before you certain facts and grievances in the following statements—to which we call your kind attention and consideration. Firstly, there stood in the village of North Dell, a slated house which became vacant nine years ago. We occupied one half of the village which contained about a hundred acres of good pasture and arable lands. The miller of Ness, who receives the 13th part of all the grain raised in Ness, envied the side we occupied ; and through promises that he never fulfilled, he persuaded us to take the land that this "" house "" stood on, telling us at the same time we were not to remove from our old houses, and that no dyke whatever was to be put round the land we were to give in exchange. This false promise of his didn't last long, for we were soon served by one, and then another summon to remove, and build ourselves houses elsewhere; then at once began dyke building, following by the pulling down of the slated "" house,"" the stones of which were put in the dyke building—the rent of which ""house"" we pay till this day over and above our land rents. Secondly, the most part, or three-fourths of the grazing land by the sea-shore we are deprived of, which originally belonged to the tack where we now are, though the rent remains the same for us to pay. Nor is this all—for the last three summers Macfarquhar's (the miller) sheep eat the most of what we sow in the ground—in our space has been so limited, made between dykes, dogs, sheep, and a little over twenty acres of land instead of one hundred acres, that we can hardly make an existence, and we ever pray your Honourable Royal Commission to look into our grievances thoroughly.",290,"Farquhar Murray","Lewis, Ness",7
