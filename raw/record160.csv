"1","JOHN STEWART, Scorrybreck, formerly at Duntulm, Proprietor of Ensay (about 60)—examined.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",1
"2","8801. Mr Cameron.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",2
"3","—When did you first become tenant of Duntulm ",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",3
"4","—I was tenant of Flodigarry in 1846. I commenced there.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",4
"5","8802. When did you take Duntulm?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",5
"6","—Four years after that.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",6
"7","8803. That was in 1850?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",7
"8","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",8
"9","8804. And you have been there ever since until last Whitsunday?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",9
"10","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",10
"11","8805. What did your stock consist of on Duntulm?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",11
"12","—Cheviot ewes and Highland cattle.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",12
"13","8806. Any blackfaced sheep?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",13
"14","—No, not one.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",14
"15","8807. Were there blackfaced sheep when you first went to Duntulm?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",15
"16","—I found no sheep at all at Duutulm.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",16
"17","8808. You put the sheep on yourself?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",17
"18","—I put the sheep on myself.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",18
"19","8809. When you left did the incoming tenant give you the valuation for your stock?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",19
"20","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",20
"21","8810. Did you find from your experience at Duntulm that sheep were more profitable to you, or the breeding of cattle?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",21
"22","—-It depends on the seasons. When the price of wool was somewhat high, of course sheep paid liberally, but now I think cattle pay quite as well.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",22
"23","8811. How many acres of arable ground are there?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",23
"24","—I have not the least idea. I can form an idea of what I cultivated myself. There was a great deal of pasture land that was formerly croft land, but I do not know the amount.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",24
"25","8812. How much did you cultivate yourself?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",25
"26","—About fifty acres.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",26
"27","8813. May I ask your reason for not continuing on Duntulm?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",27
"28","—The proprietor and I could not agree about the rent.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",28
"29","8814. The proprietor thought your rent should be raised?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",29
"30","—Yes, or kept at the old figure.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",30
"31","8815. Did you think your rent was too high already?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",31
"32","—I really thought so, or I would not have left it.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",32
"33","8816. Were you sorry to leave it?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",33
"34","—No, certainly not.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",34
"35","8817. You have no affection for it particularly?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",35
"36","—I liked the place; I was a long time there, and pretty successful.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",36
"37","8818. And if the rent had been satisfactory you would have remained?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",37
"38","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",38
"39","8819. And you regretted that you and your landlord could not agree about the rent?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",39
"40","—Yes, certainly.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",40
"41","8820. Now, to what do you attribute the fact that you were unable to continue at the same rent?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",41
"42","Was it the fall in prices; and if so, the prices of what?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",42
"43","—The price of wool had very much to do with it ; I could not farm it to pay.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",43
"44","8S21. Would you be willing to take a large sheep farm now, on which there was little or no arable ground?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",44
"45","—No, I think I will take no more farms.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",45
"46","8822. I suppose you made more out of Duntulm in the earlier years of your lease than you did in the later ones?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",46
"47","—Yes, much more.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",47
"48","8823. But you think practically sheep farming is now anything but a profitable occupation?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",48
"49","—Well, I think it is not very profitable at present.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",49
"50","8824. To what other causes do you attribute that fact besides the fall in the price of wool?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",50
"51","—Winterings are very high, and we require to winter a good many sheep.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",51
"52","8825. Are not the present high prices of sheep stock one great reason why sheep farmers are unwilling to embark in a speculation of that kind ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",52
"53","—Well, it requires a great amount of money to take a farm with any stock at present.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",53
"54","8826. Are they not afraid, if they go in when prices are very high, that when their lease comes to an end they may have to go out when prices are much lower?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",54
"55","—Yes, I have no doubt that feeling exists.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",55
"56","8827. In fact, a sheep farmer who would otherwise wish to take a farm is deterred from doing so by the fact that, on the one hand, he has to employ more capital in stocking his land ; and, on the other hand, from the low price of wool, he has to make less profit during the currency of his lease?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",56
"57","—Yes, that is my idea.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",57
"58","8828. That being so, I should like to know what your opinion is with regard to the possibility of converting Duntulm farm, or a portion of it, into small holdings, to be occupied by the race of men who have been described to us as having occupied the greater portion of that land in times past? Do you think that could be profitably done?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",58
"59","—Well, I question it.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",59
"60","8829. Will you give us your experience or your reasons why you think it could not be done?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",60
"61","—I have seen it tried in Harris perhaps forty-five years ago.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",61
"62","8830. What was the result?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",62
"63","—That the crofters only paid three or four years when the place had to be turned into a sheep run again.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",63
"64","8831. What became of the crofters?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",64
"65","—They got other holdings. I have seen adjoining the farm of Duntulm there were two or three small farms, one of which paid about £30, and another, I believe, paid about £15 of rent; and they had to give up their holdings, they found the land dear.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",65
"66","8832. What is the nature of the land in Harris that you talk of?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",66
"67","—Pretty fair arable land.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",67
"68","8833. About what size were these farms on Harris that were occupied by the small tenants, and which they had to leave?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",68
"69","—I think the rents varied from £10 to £15.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",69
"70","8834. But that would be a comparatively small croft?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",70
"71","—No, a very good extent with hill ground.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",71
"72","8835. On which they kept cattle and sheep?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",72
"73","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",73
"74","8836. How many acres of arable ground?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",74
"75","—I do not exactly know the extent of arable land.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",75
"76","8837. Do you think the rent they paid was more or less on an average than you paid on your farm of Duntulm?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",76
"77","—Much about the same.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",77
"78","8838. And these crofters could not make a living by it?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",78
"79","—So I understood.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",79
"80","8839. Suppose that, instead of there being three of £15 each, there had been two or three of £ 30 each, would that have made a difference in your opinion?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",80
"81","—Well, it depended entirely on their capital, and skill and enterprise.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",81
"82","8840. But supposing they had a fair average amount of skill and enterprise, and that they had capital sufficient, when they originally went in to stock their land, would they be able to carry on at the same rent there as you did at Duntulm?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",82
"83","—Well, I question it; I am afraid that the rent at Duntulm would be found too dear for a division of that kind.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",83
"84","8841. Suppose it was not found possible or expedient to divide Duntulm altogether amongst the small class of tenants, and that it was found possible to give some of the most suitable land to small tenants, in your opinion would that spoil the remainder of the farm for a tenant who might use the larger portion of it? Would that injure the farmer?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",84
"85","—I would be afraid it would.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",85
"86","8842. Would it prevent the farm from letting ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",86
"87","—I think so.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",87
"88","8843. In what manner?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",88
"89","—It would reduce the size of the farm; the portion which the tenants would require would be arable land, and this would take the arable land off the farm.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",89
"90","8844. But is there not land on the farm of Duntulm which is now under permanent pasture, but which could be utilised by crofters as arable ground?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",90
"91","—Oh, yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",91
"92","8845. That is to say, by ordinary delving?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",92
"93","—I believe that the most of it would require to be done on the old system of the cas-chrom.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",93
"94","8846. Why could not horses be used upon it?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",94
"95","—It is very rocky and broken ground, the land that is outside; what was cultivated by me within enclosures could be well ploughed, but most of what is outside would require to be delved with the spade or cas-chrom.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",95
"96","8847. But suppose it could be done and was done, in what way would the taking of that land injure the remaining portion of the farm of Duntulm, provided they did not take any of the present arable land that you have cultivated?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",96
"97","—I suppose it would just make the farm less.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",97
"98","8848. Would that be the only injury that would be inflicted on the farm in your opinion?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",98
"99","—I suppose it would, if there were proper marches made between them—a proper fence between the tenants and the tacksman who had the rest of the farm.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",99
"100","8849. You are well acquainted with the Isle of Skye?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",100
"101","—I think I should be.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",101
"102","8850. May I ask whether the remarks you have made in answer to my questions as regards Duntulm, would hold good with regard to other large sheep farms in Skye; that is to say, whether they would be injured only in the same degree in which you think Duntulm would be if land could be found upon them suitable to be divided amongst tenants of the smaller class?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",102
"103","—I suppose it would be something similar, if there was land to suit them.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",103
"104","8851. Then, according to the evidence you have given, there are many farms in Skye where land might be given to small tenants without deteriorating from the value of these farms except to the extent of the actual loss of land?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",104
"105","—But that would reduce the value of the land. The tenant in possession could not expect to have the same returns, nor the proprietor.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",105
"106","8852. But is it not the fact that large sheep farms which are now in the market are almost impossible to let?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",106
"107","—Well, what was explained before about the price of stocks has a good deal to do with that.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",107
"108","8853. But are you aware there are large sheep farms that have been  lately in the market, and have found no offerers at all ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",108
"109","—There may be reasons for that. Perhaps they were not very good farms, or the proprietor might be seeking too much rent. I do not think there is any good farm reasonably rented but would let.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",109
"110","8854. Are you acquainted with any proprietors in the Highlands who have been compelled to take farms into their own hands for want of tenants ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",110
"111","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",111
"112","8855. Then, in that case, if large farms are so difficult to let, might it not be for the interest of the proprietor, as well as meeting a desire which is pretty generally expressed now, if these large farms were reduced in size, and more tenants enabled to live upon the land ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",112
"113","—I suppose the proprietors who find it difficult to let their land ought to try that plan.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",113
"114","8856. What is your opinion as to the comparative advantages of Highland cattle and sheep? Do you think they could be worked together well on these farms ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",114
"115","—I have found them to do well together.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",115
"116","8857. Do you think, if that practice were more generally adopted, the sheep farms could be turned to better account than by having only sheep ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",116
"117","—I think so; in this country in particular.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",117
"118","8858. In the island of Skye ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",118
"119","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",119
"120","8859. You rather regret that there are so many sheep and so few cattle?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",120
"121","—Yes; I think there should be more cattle.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",121
"122","8860. You are a great admirer of Highland cattle, I believe1?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",122
"123","—Yes, I like them very much.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",123
"124","8861. And you are a very successful rearer of them?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",124
"125","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",125
"126","8862. You have won prizes at the Highland and Agricultural Society very frequently ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",126
"127","—Very many of them, and I expect to get a few more if I am spared. ",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",127
"128","8863. Do you think Highland cattle are suitable for large farmers as well as small crofters ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",128
"129","—Yes; they are the native breed, and resist the cold and wet of our country.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",129
"130","8864. What sort of bulls do the crofters use in the island of Skye ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",130
"131","—The best they can afford to buy. They are very endeavouring in that way.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",131
"132","8865. Are they generally pretty fair animals ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",132
"133","—Very good.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",133
"134","8866. Have you ever sold young bulls of your famous breed to the crofters ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",134
"135","—Scores of them.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",135
"136","8867. Do you find they are willing to take advantage of so excellent an opportunity of purchasing these?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",136
"137","—Very willing.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",137
"138","8868. Do you think the croftersstock has improved or deteriorated of late years ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",138
"139","—Very much improved.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",139
"140","8869. What is your impression of the relative condition of the crofters at the present time compared with what it was when you first came to the country ? Do you think they are better off and more comfortable, or not ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",140
"141","—Well, I am afraid not in a sense. We are all more extravagant. I am a tenant myself, and I am much more extravagant thao I was thirty years ago; all my requirements are more.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",141
"142","8870. I suppose we are all more extravagant, from the highest in the land to the simple crofters ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",142
"143","—Yes; and we have had a very bad season this last year, which has damped the crofters very much. They lost their corn almost altogether, but they have had good fishings and easy access to the south, where labour is very abundant.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",143
"144","8871. Do you think they devote less attention to fishing than they used to do ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",144
"145","—No, they go to the fishing every year. They are very anxious in that way. They go to Ireland and the east coast and everywhere. ",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",145
"146","8872. In short, they show a considerable amount of energy as to fishing?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",146
"147","—Yes; if they had better boats and more of them, the people would struggle on and be successful too. ",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",147
"148","8873. And do you think they would struggle and endeavour to be successful on land if they had the chance? Do you think they are equally suited to become successful farmers as to become successful fishermen?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",148
"149","—Well, I am afraid not.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",149
"150","8874. Do you think they have not got the requisite perseverance or skill, or what is it?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",150
"151","—They are more indolent about their own land than they might be. There are no better workers or more faithful men for others, but I am afraid they are a little indolent at home. There are exceptions, of course.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",151
"152","8875. Do you think anything could be done to increase their skill in agriculture— to give them better information on agricultural matters, so as to enable them more successfully to cope with the  difficulties of the climate?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",152
"153","—Yes, I think a good deal might be done in that way.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",153
"154","8876. And you think they would be willing to learn if they had the chance?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",154
"155","—Yes, and to help them by enclosures.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",155
"156","8877. What do you mean by that?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",156
"157","—Divisions of their crofts.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",157
"158","8878. Fences?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",158
"159","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",159
"160","8879. To enclose their arable land from their hill land1",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",160
"161","—Yes, so as to enable them to sow grass seed. They cannot do so when the farm is in a common, without division or enclosures. They have no encouragement to put down any green crop or grass seed.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",161
"162","8880. Your opinion is that it is the want of enclosures which ought to exist, to prevent the trespass of their cattle on their arable ground, that prevents them sowing grass seeds?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",162
"163","—A good deal of that.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",163
"164","8881. So if they had better fences they would be more encouraged to adopt a better system of rotation of crops?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",164
"165","—Yes, and in many cases to take in more of the outland.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",165
"166","8882. Do you think they would be willing to do that?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",166
"167","—Oh, yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",167
"168","8883. Do you think improving leases would be any encouragement to them?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",168
"169","—Yes, I really think so.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",169
"170","8884. Do you think they would be willing to take leases? ",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",170
"171","—I think so, if the restrictions were not very stringent.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",171
"172","8885. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",172
"173","—I think, since you have been at Duntulm, several additions have been made to the farm ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",173
"174","—Some additions.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",174
"175","8886. Were they hill lands, or were there lowlands along with them?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",175
"176","—Both.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",176
"177","8887. One whole township was added to Duntulm?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",177
"178","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",178
"179","8888. And the people were removed to neighbouring townships ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",179
"180","—Yes, but two old tenants died.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",180
"181","8889. Can you tell me whether you gave the landlord a better rent for these lands than the original tenants had been able to give?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",181
"182","—I think I was charged more than they paid for them.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",182
"183","8890. Were you willing to give more?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",183
"184","—Well, I had to do so.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",184
"185","8891. There were a number of crofters situated near you at Kilmaluag?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",185
"186","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",186
"187","8892. Do you know what sort of rent they paid for their land?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",187
"188","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",188
"189","8893. Do you think those lands were worth more to a man of capital, a large farmer, than they were to these crofters at Kilmaluag?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",189
"190","—Not worth more, I think. I think they were paying full rent for them; I should say too much now.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",190
"191","8894. Were they paying as much in proportion for the land as you were paying for Duntulm?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",191
"192","—Scarcely; I was paying more rent for the last twelve years. I think it was about the dearest place in the whole island of Skye during the last twelve years.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",192
"193","8895. And you do not think on the whole that the crofters could pay such a full rent for the land as the large farmers pay?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",193
"194","—Not by the returns of the land alone, if they had no other resources.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",194
"195","8896. But suppose they had crofts of such a size as would prevent them going fishing, would they then be able to pay such a reut as the large farmer?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",195
"196","—I would be afraid not.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",196
"197","8897. You spoke of indolence at home. Do you think that indolence at home arises from want of confidence in the landlord, from fear of their rents being raised if they make improvements on their crofts?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",197
"198","—Yes, I think so; they assert that.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",198
"199","8898. Do you think that indolence would disappear if they had such security as tenants have in other parts of the country?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",199
"200","—Well, it would disappear from a good many of them. There might be a lazy class for all that; but still, as a general rule, I think it would stir up the people a god deal to better their condition and improve their houses.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",200
"201","8899. With regard to crofts of the size we find in Kilmuir, would it be at all profitable to enclose each croft with an enclosing dyke? You have said that you cannot expect them to sow grass seed unless land is enclosed, and that is quite true?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",201
"202","—Yes, it is an advantage to have it enclosed.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",202
"203","8900. But would it pay the expense to enclose each individual croft of the size that crofts are now ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",203
"204","—I think it would.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",204
"205","8901. Even where they are crofts of six acres?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",205
"206","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",206
"207","8902. With stone dykes?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",207
"208","—Yes, I suppose.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",208
"209","8903. When I talk of paying I mean, could the holder of the land pay interest on the cost of that improvement in addition to the ordinary rent?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",209
"210","—It depends on the rent he is paying; if he had it at'a reasonable rent",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",210
"211","8904. Suppose the farm of Duntulm were cut up into a number of townships, rented as low as Kilmaluag, which you say was fully lower than Duntulm, could the proprietor erect dykes around each crofter's holding, and expect the crofters to pay interest upon the cost of building these dykes?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",211
"212","—Not at the present rent, because the rent is increased by school rates, road money, and other things, and with a rate of interest to pay it would come to be too much money.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",212
"213","8905. And yet after all it does not come up to the rent of the large farm ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",213
"214","—Well, I think not.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",214
"215","8906. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",215
"216","—You have now taken, I understand, the farm of Scorrybreck ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",216
"217","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",217
"218","8907. Is it a very large farm?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",218
"219","—Yes, it is a large farm.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",219
"220","8908. What was the last rent you were paying for Duntulm and Flodigarry?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",220
"221","—I think £1525, or something like that.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",221
"222","8909. For these two farms?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",222
"223","—Three—Duntulm, Flodigarry, and Sartle.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",223
"224","8910. Do you know what the proprietor is getting from the present tenant?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",224
"225","—I am not aware, but it think it is a pretty smart rent.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",225
"226","8911. Is it a fair question to ask how much you were willing to give him for a new lease?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",226
"227","—I offered £1250.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",227
"228","8912. You went first to Flodigarry, what did you pay for it?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",228
"229","—£200.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",229
"230","8913. How much for Duntulm?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",230
"231","—£330.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",231
"232","8914. And how much for Sartle?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",232
"233","—£130, but there were additions.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",233
"234","8915. Then before you left that estate your rental was more than doubled?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",234
"235","—Well, there were additions made to the farms; there were some lands thrown in.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",235
"236","8916. What were they ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",236
"237","—Lachsay and Scor.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",237
"238","8917. Who were the people on Scor?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",238
"239","—The tenant who was there when I went was Sandy Macphail.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",239
"240","8918. Was he the only tenant there?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",240
"241","—I think so; he and his son-inlaw.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",241
"242","8919. What was your rent at the time Captain Fraser became proprietor ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",242
"243","—I don't exactly remember.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",243
"244","8920. Did he put it up?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",244
"245","—Yes, considerably..",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",245
"246","8921. So it is not the croftersland alone that he put up?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",246
"247","—No, more than once my rent was raised.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",247
"248","8922. Can you give us a rough estimate of how much arable land there was upon those three farms which had once been cultivated?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",248
"249","—I really cannot say.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",249
"250","8923. You yourself only cultivated about 50 acres?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",250
"251","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",251
"252","8924. Can you not give us a rough estimate?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",252
"253","—No, I cannot: there was a great deal that had been in cultivation with the crooked spade.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",253
"254","8925. And it had once borne crop ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",254
"255","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",255
"256","8926. Am I exaggerating if I say 500 acres ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",256
"257","—A great deal more than that.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",257
"258","8927. Would you say 1000 acres?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",258
"259","—No, 1 would not say that.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",259
"260","8928. But a great deal more than 500 acres?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",260
"261","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",261
"262","8929. And those are the lands which you referred to when you said they were not perhaps altogether ready for the plough?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",262
"263","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",263
"264","8930. Because they had been cultivated by hand?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",264
"265","—Yes, I believe that small crofts would still be better to be cultivated by the spade.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",265
"266","8931. As regards Harris, don't you think matters have changed very much since forty-five years ago?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",266
"267","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",267
"268","8932. Are you paying a smaller rent for Scorrybreck than the previous tenant paid?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",268
"269","—I believe I am paying more.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",269
"270","8933. Do you get any advantage that he did not possess?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",270
"271","—No, I do not; on the contrary, he had the one half of the shooting, and I don't have it.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",271
"272","8934. Did you wish the shooting?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",272
"273","—I should like it; it would be an advantage.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",273
"274","8935. You stated in answer to a previous inquiry that you thought Highland cattle were the best source of making money?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",274
"275","—I think so.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",275
"276","8936. For a big fanner as for a little farmer?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",276
"277","—Yes, I think a mixed stock is best where the land suits.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",277
"278","8937. I would like to ask you, in reference to your remark about the people being rather indolent at home and excellent workers abroad, you mean that you believed that arose to some extent from the people not being very sure that they would be left in their holdings?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",278
"279","—I attributed it to that. I do not say it is the case with all of them, but I think a good many of them are idly passing their time at home.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",279
"280","8938. Are you aware there are a great number of families that have been removed twice, three, four, and in some cases five times?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",280
"281","—Not families of any importance or consequence; they may have fishermen or crofters.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",281
"282","8939. Would you suppose that such people would have any inducement to improve the places they are on for the time?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",282
"283","—Certainly not, and that is my reason for saying they should have some hold on their ground.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",283
"284","8940. As you have lived so long in Skye, would you mention the length of lease they would be disposed to accept upon getting larger and improved crofts?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",284
"285","—I should suppose nothing less than fifteen years.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",285
"286","8941. Do you think they would be content with fifteen years?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",286
"287","—I should think so.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",287
"288","8942. Are you aware that in other parts of the country, such as Aberdeen and Inverness-shires, a great deal of hill land has been reclaimed upon improving leases of thirty-one years?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",288
"289","—-Yes, but these were very hopeless subjects when they commenced them.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",289
"290","8943. You also stated that not only some of the old land once in cultivation might be taken in, but also some good pasture land that had never been cultivated?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",290
"291","—I think I said something to the effect, that land which had been cultivated many years ago might be broken up to advantage,",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",291
"292","8944. But is there not land that never was under cultivation at all that might bo taken in with advantage?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",292
"293","—Yes, but that would involve great outlay.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",293
"294","8945. And you would give them a long lease?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",294
"295","—Yes, certainly; thirty years at least.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",295
"296","8946. With such a long lease, say for thirty years, would you approve of the rental being a small sum at the beginning, rising gradually to a certain amount?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",296
"297","—Yes, certainly, rising every ten years, and rising according to the profit.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",297
"298","8947. We have heard on every hand a great desire expressed on the part of the people to get more land. Does that demand, in your opinion really arise from a sincere desire to better themselves and improve their position at home?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",298
"299","—Oh, I suppose so.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",299
"300","8948. And while no doubt some of them would not be able to stock those enlarged crofts all at once, is there any doubt that there are a good uumber of clever and active men with strong arms who would be able to begin and do something at once?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",300
"301","—I should think so. They have strong arms. If people have the will they can always get the way.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",301
"302","8949. Would not the same class of people, if they knew they were likely not to be disturbed, be disposed in your opinion at once to begin to improve their houses?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",302
"303","—They would be disposed if they had the means; but some of them are short of means.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",303
"304","8950. But those that have a little means would be disposed to do so?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",304
"305","—I think so.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",305
"306","8951. In answer to a question, you stated that the people generally were more extravagant than formerly, and that you yourself were?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",306
"307","—Yes, men who contented themselves with home produce at first must now have tea and all those extravagant outside luxuries or foreign ingredients, and the young people going south get into these habits and accustom us to these things at home, so that we have all got more extravagant.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",307
"308","8952. Do not all these things—what we may call improved food and extravagance in dress—point to a higher standard of living altogether, and that it is very likely their houses would be improved by themselves?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",308
"309","—If they were in position and circumstances to do so, I have no doubt they would improve their houses.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",309
"310","8953. Is there auything all over Skye that is in a lower position, whether for man or beast, than the dwellings? Are the houses in proportion much worse than the style of food the people eat or the clothes they wear ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",310
"311","—Yes; but the houses inside are much more comfortable than a stranger would suppose from looking at the outside.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",311
"312","8954. Are they not generally very dirty?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",312
"313","—No, they are not; neither dirty nor inhospitable.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",313
"314","8955. Far be it from me to suggest such a thing as that; on the contrary. As regards the people, we have received the very kindest treatment. I spoke of houses. Were there many people removed from farms during your possession, at the instance of the landlord?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",314
"315","—Not one.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",315
"316","8956. During all the forty years you were there?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",316
"317","—Not one.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",317
"318","8957. You have seen or heard of numerous instances in Skye during your days?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",318
"319","—Not in my end of the country at all.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",319
"320","8958. Whatever was done was before your time?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",320
"321","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",321
"322","8959. Was not Scorrybreck very full of people at one time?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",322
"323","—I am not aware. But you can see traces where the land has been cultivated.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",323
"324","8960. You have walked over your new farm ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",324
"325","—Yes. ",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",325
"326","8961. Don't you see the remains of old cultivation and ruins everywhere ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",326
"327","—Yes. ",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",327
"328","8962. Have you any idea of the extent of the acreage of Scorrybreck?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",328
"329","—Not the least.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",329
"330","8963. Is it 10,000 acres?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",330
"331","— I suppose it is.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",331
"332","8964. How many people are on it ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",332
"333","—Only shepherds; seven or eight families altogether.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",333
"334","8965. The Chairman.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",334
"335","—We have heard it stated to-day that keeping sheep for a length of time upon pasture ground depreciates the quality of the pasture. Is that consistent with your experience?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",335
"336","—No, I have not noticed that.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",336
"337","8966. Have you ever heard it said in the country, that pasturing ground by sheep alone for a length of time spoils the pasture ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",337
"338","—That is my own idea—that the sheep are the better of having cattle with them.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",338
"339","8967. Do you think it is the mixture of cattle with sheep that prevents the ground being spoiled ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",339
"340","—I think so.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",340
"341","8968. What is the reason? How is it that the mixture of the cattle keeps the pasture wholesome and abundant?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",341
"342","—I suppose the larger animal crops the large coarse grass that the sheep passes over, and also manures the land better.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",342
"343","8969. You have stated that the quality of the crofterscattle is very much improved, and it has been argued from that, that the crofters are now better able to pay their rent than they formerly would have been. Is the higher price of cattle which the crofters now get chiefly owing to the greater demand, or is it owing to the better quality of the animal?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",343
"344","—To both.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",344
"345","8970. But it is partly owing to the better quality of the animal?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",345
"346","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",346
"347","8971. Does the crofter contribute by his own expenditure or skill to make the quality better? Does he, for instance, feed the cattle more expensively?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",347
"348","—I am afraid they have not been so well fed this year. The crop was rather scarce this year.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",348
"349","8972. But generally, do you think the crofter gives his cattle better food now than he did twenty years ago ? Does he feed them more for the market ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",349
"350","—No; I don't think they feed them any better than they used to do",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",350
"351","8973. But you stated that they have expended some money in obtaining better bulls?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",351
"352","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",352
"353","8974. You have said that you think the people might be inclined to take up new crofts and larger crofts, and be capable of cultivating and stocking them. Do you think, in case such better crofts were granted to them, that they would submit to prohibition of dividing them. Do you think they would see it was impolitic to divide them, and submit not to divide them?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",353
"354","—It is very difficult to prevent division of the crofts. I am afraid they would not be pleased to bind themselves by restrictions of that sort.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",354
"355","8975. Sheriff Nicolson.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",355
"356","—There were no evictions made for the purpose of adding to Duntulm in your time ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",356
"357","—No.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",357
"358","8976. But there was a good deal of pasture taken from the people on both sides of the hill ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",358
"359","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",359
"360","8977. When was Sartle added to Duntulm ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",360
"361","—I got Sartle before I got Duntulm; when Hugh Macleod failed I got it.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",361
"362","8978. There were no crofters there ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",362
"363","—No; there were cottars.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",363
"364","8979. But there was a considerable strip of moor taken from the people of Brogaig, Deig, and Glasbhen ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",364
"365","—Yes, and added to Sartle.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",365
"366","8980. When was that done?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",366
"367","—It is twelve or fourteen years ago.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",367
"368","8981. Was that a very great disadvantage to the people there 1",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",368
"369","—To some of them.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",369
"370","8982. They are now not allowed to keep a horse or a sheep, because they have no hill ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",370
"371","—They have very few horses, but they have some sheep stilL",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",371
"372","8983. Was not Sartle big enough before, joined to Flodigarry and Duntulm, without that strip of moor?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",372
"373","—Yes.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",373
"374","8984. Was the thing done at the proprietor's suggestion or at yours t",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",374
"375","—I never requested it; I never solicited or asked an acre of any man, great or small.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",375
"376","8985. Was it offered to you ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",376
"377","—All the farms that I got were farms that could not be held by those that went before me.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",377
"378","8986. Do you allow your shepherds to keep a cow ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",378
"379","—Yes, three of them. Some shepherds have three cows each; in general they have two.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",379
"380","8987. But there is not one crofter at Scorrybreck ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",380
"381","—There is one poor cottar down at Rigg—a woman.seventy-five years of age.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",381
"382","8988. How many miles is it walking round the cliffs from your house to Rigg ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",382
"383","—About eleven miles.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",383
"384","8989. All inhabited by sheep ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",384
"385","—And cattle and rabbits.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",385
"386","8990. Are there rabbits too ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",386
"387","—Plenty of them.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",387
"388","8991. Was there any of the crofterspasture that was given to you by Major Fraser, and afterwards sublet by you to the people ?",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",388
"389","—No.",160,"John Stewart","Skye, Portree",389
