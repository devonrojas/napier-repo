"1","JOHN CAMPBELL, Crofter's Son, Balvraid Muir (52)—examined.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",1
"2","39677. The Chairman.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",2
"3","—Have you got any written statement?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",3
"4","—Yes. ",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",4
"5","Grievance of the Badinisli and Balvraid Tenants.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",5
"6","—These people are a part of those who were expelled from the neighbouring lands to make room for the large farms of Skelbo, Torboll, Cambusavie, and Trentam and were huddled together on this black heath. Built houses there at their own expense, and cultivated patches of land which can never be made productive, owing to the natural sterility of the moor. They are wholly dependent on these poor holdings, and they are not sufficient to maintain them above a few months in the year. When a new name is entered on the rent roll the rent is raised, in some cases from 7s. to £5, 10s. They complain of the scarcity of pasture, the enclosed woods, which was at one time their pasture, being at their door, from which game comes and injures their crops, for which loss tbey get no compensation. The people earnestly desire that the lands of their forefathers should be restored to them, and earnestly appeal to the Commissioners for restitution of their rights. The tenants' grievances are insecurity of tenure, no protection against rack-renting, and no compensation for the improvements they make in reclaiming and draining land, and building houses, barns, and byres. They complain that on the money they may get for making improvements there is made a perpetual charge at a high rate of interest.'",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",6
"7","39678. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",7
"8","—How long have the tenants of Badinish and Balvraid been there?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",8
"9","—I suppose the first of them came there about 1833.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",9
"10","39679. Evicted from these large arable farms?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",10
"11","—Yes; but there is a delegate from Dornoch, an old man, Sandy Mackintosh, who can testify to this and he has seen his father's and his grandfather's houses on fire.He has a personal grievance of his own.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",11
"12","39680. Do you know what rents they paid when they were first settled?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",12
"13","—Nominal A nominal rent; some of them Is. Then their parents improved the land with the help of the children as they were getting up and when the father died the rent was raised, and successively raised in cases of death within a few years after that I will give you an instance of a woman—Isabel Mathieson —living in the neighbourhood. Her father paid a rent of Is. He improved a few acres of land. He died, and the son was entered as tenant. He was rented at £3.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",13
"14","39681. Do you know how long it was afterwards?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",14
"15","—No, I don't; and about eight years after the son became tenant he died, and this woman was rented at £6 and a few shillings —at seventy years of age—and she cannot keep more than a cow, a horse, and a stirk.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",15
"16","39682. Was she a sister of the man?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",16
"17","—A sister of the man who entered after his father. I think there were six or seven years between the deaths of the father and brother.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",17
"18","39683. Can you give us the history of your own mother's croft?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",18
"19","—My mother's croft is supposed to have suffered more through evictions than any other in Sutherland. Mr Mackenzie describes the evictions on page 115 of his Clearances; and last year I suffered fourteen days' imprisonment for an expression of dissent against the incoming tenant.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",19
"20","39684. Was it your father who was evicted?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",20
"21","—My father; and I was ten years of age at the time.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",21
"22","39685. But you said the evictions took place fifty years ago?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",22
"23","—This was at a later date.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",23
"24","39686. Where was your father when he was evicted?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",24
"25","—My father was not evicted from these lands, because these lands were in the parish of Rogart.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",25
"26","39687. He was evicted from Rogart?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",26
"27","—Yes, forty-two years ago; but I don't complain of that.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",27
"28","39688. Was the land to which he came bare moorland?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",28
"29","—No; my father didn't come here.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",29
"30","33689. Is your mother not here now?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",30
"31","—No, she is not in the parish of Rogart.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",31
"32","39690. You have no interest in this district?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",32
"33","—No; I am merely a delegate. I reside in the place six or seven months in the year.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",33
"34","39691. Have you any further statement you wish to make about these evictions, and about the uncertainty of tenure?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",34
"35","—Yes. Whenever a new name enters, the rent is raised—sometimes from 7s. to £6 —after all their",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",35
"36","own and their forefathers' labour. On this barren heath there is no pasture of any kind; and there is a long bleak] ridge, with a northern exposure, about one mile in length and half a mile in breadth, and they have no pasture on it, and most of them have to toil cutting whins for their beasts.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",36
"37","39692. They are allowed to cut whins in the neighbourhood?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",37
"38","—Yes, but that was all taken from them this last spring. The visitors have got it.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",38
"39","39693. For what purpose?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",39
"40","—That is best known to themselves. Perhaps it is for improving the woods, but that supply is cut off from them.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",40
"41","39694. There are no hill lands in the neighbourhood of these farms now, are there?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",41
"42","—Yes, the pasture lands on the farm of Cambusavie are in the neighbourhood.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",42
"43","39695. In whose possession is that?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",43
"44","—Mr Urquhart's.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",44
"45","39696. Is it a large farm ?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",45
"46","—There are two shepherds and a two-horse arable farm.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",46
"47","30697. Is there any pasture attached to these lands of Skelbo and Torboll?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",47
"48","—Yes, it is a large sheep farm. ",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",48
"49","39698. But a large arable farm too?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",49
"50","—No; two pair of horses. Skelbo, I think, keeps five pair of horses. ",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",50
"51","39699. Was it from the lands now arable that the crofters were evicted?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",51
"52","—Yes. ",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",52
"53","39700. And these lands were cleared off and made into large farms?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",53
"54","— Yes; and the people were driven away to these barren heaths, where none but men in despairing circumstances would attempt it.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",54
"55","39701. Sheriff Nicolson.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",55
"56","—What was this that happened last year?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",56
"57","—It was an eviction in the parish of Rogart at the instance of the Duke. The keeper was averse to the incoming tenant, who was the son of a southern shepherd who took an active part in the burning. His name was Robert Orr, and I used the expression that he would never come there I was tried before the sheriff.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",57
"58","39702. It was for using threatening expressions?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",58
"59","—Yes; of course, there was a lot of people gathered.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",59
"60","39703. Was there anything of a riot?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",60
"61","—No; we were convicted of a breach of the peace.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",61
"62","39704. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",62
"63","—You mentioned one or two cases where the rents had been very much raised on the deaths of the tenants; are you aware from your knowledge of the country that the Duke of Sutherland employed two men to value the small crofts?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",63
"64","—I am, but what kind of a valuation was it?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",64
"65","39705. Both the valuators are strangers to the country, they do not belong to Sutherland?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",65
"66","—Yes.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",66
"67","39706. Are you aware that they asked the crofters themselves, or made any inquiries as to who made the improvements on the lands that were valued, or how long the crofters had the benefit of their own reclamations?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",67
"68","—To my knowledge they never made any inquiries, and they never travelled the ground. I was up at Rogart, on my mother's land, and I could see they were almost a quarter of a mile away when they",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",68
"69","took out the rent roll, looked at the place, and walked away. I got the same version ever since from every other person. They may have travelled the ground in some instances, but I never heard of it.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",69
"70","39707. Then you are prepared to say that the people themselves were not spoken to or asked to give any information as to what they had done, or how long they had been in possession?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",70
"71","—None, so far as I made inquiries about it, and to my own knowledge that is the way they stood looking at my mother's croft. They came on the opposite side, not far off—about a quarter of a mile—and they took out the rent-roll and walked away, the ground officers telling them, I suppose, the croft, and the name of the tenant. I believe the Duke never intended that. I believe he meant the valuation to be in a just and fair way, and if that had been done, very few complaints would have been heard by the Commission.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",71
"72","39708. Would your opinion of a true valuation be this, that the parties sent to value would make inquiry who made the improvements in the first place, and how long since, and then would fix the rent?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",72
"73","—Undoubtedly, that they would walk over the ground to see what kind of soil it was, and I think they should consult some local expert as to what return the land was giving for the labour bestowed upon it. I would call that a just valuation.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",73
"74","39709. Mr Cameron.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",74
"75","—Don't you think that would, perhaps, be more for the proprietor than for a paid professional valuator to do, taking into consideration how long the tenant had been there, with the view of fixing the rent? Would it not be more the business of the proprietor to give that consideration towards the tenants to see how long they had been there, than for paid professional valuators to go into these questions?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",75
"76","—Well, I don't know, but perhaps these men had been instructed to do so. I am of opinion the Duke meant a just valuation, and all inquiries to be made about the land.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",76
"77","39710. How many tenants are in Balvraid?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",77
"78","—Ten in Balvraid and fourteen in Badinish.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",78
"79","39711. Then you are a delegate from these ten?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",79
"80","—Yes.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",80
"81","39712. Do you know why they appointed you delegate rather than one of themselves?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",81
"82","—I have been so long among them that they look upon me as one of themselves.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",82
"83","39713. The Chairman.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",83
"84","—What season was it when the valuators came round; were the crops on the ground?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",84
"85","—Yes. I am not prepared to say the exact time, but I think it was about August, or maybe sooner, or some weeks later. I know it was, back or forward, about that time.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",85
"86","39714. Do you think that the valuators were ordered just to value the ground as they saw it without any reference to who made it so, or do you think they were told to take into consideration the work that had been bestowed upon it by the tenants?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",86
"87","—Well, I could not say, but I would think, in my opinion, that they were told to make a fair and just valuation. That was my opinion.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",87
"88","39715. You gave a case in which there had been two rises of rent; tell me the particulars again?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",88
"89","—Neil Leslie married a niece of the former tenant.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",89
"90","39716. What was the former tenant's rent?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",90
"91","—7s.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",91
"92","39717. Was Neil Leslie's rent put up?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",92
"93","—When the tenant died—his wife's uncle—he was rented at £5, 10s.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",93
"94","39718. Who died next?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",94
"95","—He is still in possession.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",95
"96","39719. What rent is he now paying?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",96
"97","—£5, 10s.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",97
"98","39720. But that is not the case I mean?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",98
"99","—With regard to Isabel Mathieson, at first her father paid a nominal rent of Is. When the father died, the son was entered as tenant, and he was rented at £3. Then the son died six or seven years after the father, and Isabel succeeded.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",99
"100","39721. How much was she rented at?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",100
"101","—About £6, 10s.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",101
"102","39722. What was the estimate of the value of the holding?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",102
"103","—I cannot say.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",103
"104","39723. Did she get it above or below the valuation?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",104
"105","—I cannot say.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",105
"106","39724. How many acres has she got?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",106
"107","—Eight or nine acres of the sort of soil.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",107
"108","39725. Is there any hill pasture attached?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",108
"109","—None at all, and the soil there is not worth even Is. 6d. an acre.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",109
"110","39726. You mean, now it is improved, it is not worth more than Is. 6d. ?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",110
"111","—I asked a man who was a judge of pasture some weeks ago, in case the tenants were ejected from their holdings, what rent he would give for it for a sheep pasture. He said he would not have it for nothing, for in two years it would turn to heather again.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",111
"112","39727. Is Isabel Mathieson married?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",112
"113","—No, she lives with her sister. She is about seventy years of age.",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",113
"114","39728. How do the two women work the croft?",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",114
"115","—The best way they can, I suppose. They get help from the neighbours. They cannot keep it long. It is just a struggle for existence",659,"John Campbell","Sutherland, Bonar Bridge",115
