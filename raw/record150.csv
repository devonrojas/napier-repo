"1","JOHN M'LEAN, Crofter and Fisherman, Oscaig (38)—examined.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",1
"2","7920. The Chairman",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",2
"3","—You were freely elected a delegate?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",3
"4","—Yes. ",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",4
"5","7921. Have you got a statement to make on the part of the people?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",5
"6","—All I have to say is that our land is small and dear, and the rent too high.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",6
"7","7922. Mr Cameron.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",7
"8","—What rent do you pay?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",8
"9","—£14.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",9
"10","7923. What is your summing?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",10
"11","—One cow and a stirk.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",11
"12","7924. Why do you pay so high a rent?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",12
"13","—Well, we have good comfortable cottages that Mr Wood has built for us there, and we are charged mostly for the houses; but then we have only a very small patch of land connected with these houses.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",13
"14","7925. Do you know what the houses cost?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",14
"15","—No, I am not entitled to know what the houses cost, but I know what I paid for them.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",15
"16","7926. What interest do you pay on the money?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",16
"17","—I cannot exactly tell that either. Mr Wood built them the first year he came.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",17
"18","7927. What was the rent before the houses were built?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",18
"19","—I had in my memory two tenants or crofters keeping the whole place I am in at the present time between the two. They had the common as well as the rest of the crofters that were on the land. They had liberty to have fifty to sixty sheep, and a pair of horses each, and they were keeping a summing of eight milk cows coming into their byres; and they had some yeld cattle on the hill.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",19
"20","7928. But what was the rent of your particular croft for which you now pay £14? What did you pay for that before the house was built?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",20
"21","— I did not enter into the croft until such time as the house was built. The houses are new and the crofts are new at the present time. But I remember when the whole place was occupied by two crofters; and there is one park now, which measures about nineteen acres, taken off the others, and occupied by Mr Wood himself.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",21
"22","7929. Professor MacKinnon.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",22
"23","—You remember when the hill of Oscaig was in the hands of two people, with a park of nineteen acres more than there is among you six now?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",23
"24","—Yes.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",24
"25","7930. And the total rent was what?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",25
"26","—£20.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",26
"27","7931. And now it has been relotted into six, and the total rent is £60?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",27
"28","—Yes.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",28
"29","7932. The rent being charged chiefly because of the cottages, not because of the land?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",29
"30","—Yes.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",30
"31","7933. Mr Cameron.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",31
"32","—Do you get regular work from Mr Wood?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",32
"33","—Yes, I have no cause of complaint. We get regular work and wages; but, at the same time, we complain of the smallness of the wages as much as of the smallness of the land, because people depend merely on the day's wages, and we suppose 13s. a week is hardly able to keep a family, or a family of we such as I have. I have four and my wife and myself —it is six—and I consider 13s. a week is barely enough to support me in meat and clothes, and to pay the rent.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",33
"34","7934. Would you rather have a worse house and pay less rent?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",34
"35","—Well, most decidedly, if I was as comfortably off otherwise. I daresay I could live as my forefathers did live in the worst houses, and they lived as old as I will do; and my father died last year, eighty years of age, and I do not know if I will live that long.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",35
"36","7935. Do you think the test of happiness is to live as long as possible?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",36
"37","—No.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",37
"38","7936. Would you rather have a less rent and a worse house?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",38
"39","—I complain of the house even as it is. I would take the house.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",39
"40","7937. But you cannot live in the house without paying a fair rent upon what it costs to build. You cannot live in a good house, and pay the rent of a bad one ?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",40
"41","—I think there are houses that will do the like of a man of my income, and be less rented, for the income can never pay the outlay. ",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",41
"42","7938. You complain of that, and you complain that the wages are too low?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",42
"43","—We have to pay the expense that has to come out of them.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",43
"44","7939. Professor Mackinnon.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",44
"45","—I see your croft is £14. There is Donald Gillies, £14, and the other crofters are £8?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",45
"46","—Yes.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",46
"47","7940. Are all the houses the same ?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",47
"48","—Yes.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",48
"49","7941. That is, the houses of John Gillies and Murdo M'Leod are as good as yours?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",49
"50","—Yes, but these only hold one or two apartments —only half the house. They have a whole croft, but only the half of the house.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",50
"51","7942. So the houses have been subdivided as well as the crofts?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",51
"52","—Donald Gillies and I have a whole house.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",52
"53","7943. Donald Gillies and you are allowed to keep a horse?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",53
"54","—Yes; but I daresay, if you put the whole six of us together, the whole produce of the land would not keep a horse.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",54
"55","7944. How does Gillies, too, keep a horse?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",55
"56","—Because he has the roads, and he cannot work the roads very well without a horse.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",56
"57","7945. Do the six of you get steady work at 13s. a week?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",57
"58","—Yes, and I don't know of any man who has been refused work by the proprietor since he came.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",58
"59","7946. And your house and Donald Gillies' are double the size of the others; that is to say the others are half. Can you let any part of your house?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",59
"60","—I believe Mr Wood would not object to us doing it.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",60
"61","7947. But you don't make any money by letting it?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",61
"62","—No.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",62
"63","7948. You are not in the habit of letting it?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",63
"64","—Well, I am not supposed to do it.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",64
"65","7949. Do you take any lodgers?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",65
"66","—Sometimes I take in lodgers.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",66
"67","7950. For payment ?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",67
"68","— At 2s. per week, which is the regular rule of charge for lodgers, but it is very seldom I take them.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",68
"69","7951. The complaint is that the houses are rented too high?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",69
"70","—Yes, and the crofts too; because we are compelled to pay the extra sum of money for the croft, which is a very small portion. I don't believe it is much more than one and a quarter acres of arable land.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",70
"71","7952. The Chairman..",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",71
"72","—What sort of house is it you have? Is it stone, lime, and slate?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",72
"73","—Yes.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",73
"74","7953. How many stories high?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",74
"75","—Only one.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",75
"76","7954. How many rooms are there in it?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",76
"77","—Two rooms and two bedclosets; a closet entering from each room.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",77
"78","7955. There is a kitchen?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",78
"79","—Yes.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",79
"80","7956. And a bed-room?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",80
"81","—Yes.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",81
"82","7957. And two bed-closets?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",82
"83","—There is a kitchen and a closet off the kitchen, and at the other end of the house they are the same—a room and a closet off the room.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",83
"84","7958. Is there anything upstairs in the loft?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",84
"85","—There is no stair at all ; no ladder.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",85
"86","7959. Is there any milk house or place outside behind?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",86
"87","—We are provided with a byre and barn for the benefit of the croft.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",87
"88","7960. Is there any washing house?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",88
"89","—No.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",89
"90","7961. Or any apartment outside at all?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",90
"91","—No.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",91
"92","7962. How large are these closets attached to the two rooms?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",92
"93","—About eight feet square.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",93
"94","7963. Is there a bed in each?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",94
"95","—You can put a bed in them.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",95
"96","7964. Is there a fire-place in the closets?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",96
"97","—No.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",97
"98","7965. But a fire-place in each of the other rooms?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",98
"99","—Yes.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",99
"100","7966. How much do you suppose such a house would cost to build!",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",100
"101","—I heard they cost about £200.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",101
"102","7967. I speak of the house you inhabit, should you think it cost about £200?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",102
"103","—Yes",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",103
"104","7968. Including the barn and the byre ?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",104
"105","—I am not sure whether that is taken in or not.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",105
"106","7969. Perhaps it would cost £250 with the barn and byre?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",106
"107","—I don't know.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",107
"108","7970. Now, have you got a garden near the house for vegetables?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",108
"109","—We have part of our own croft. Each end has got a croft—a strip opposite itself —and then there is a piece taken off from every croft, and fenced.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",109
"110","7971. Within the potato ground?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",110
"111","—Yes.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",111
"112","7972. How much will the land keep, one cow or two cows?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",112
"113","—It is just one cow we are allowed to keep—the grazing of one cow.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",113
"114","7973. Any sheep? ",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",114
"115","— We are not allowed to keep sheep, but some have kept two or three sheep, mostly for petting.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",115
"116","7974. How do you provide the provender for the cow in winter?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",116
"117","—Just in the bit of land we have.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",117
"118","7975. Do you get enough to support her in winter?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",118
"119","—Scarcely.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",119
"120","7976. But nearly?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",120
"121","—Yes, but there are few of us who have not to buy something.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",121
"122","7977. Then you have a good cottage and a little garden, and a cow's grass, and enough land to produce food for the cow in winter, and you pay £14?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",122
"123","—Yes.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",123
"124","7978. If you ceased to work for day's wages to the landlord would the landlord remove you?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",124
"125","—No, I don't think it. We don't blame the landlord in the least, because I think the landlord is very kind to us, and very good to the people.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",125
"126","7979. Does your garden grow good vegetables? Could you grow, carrots and peas?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",126
"127","—I daresay we could grow carrots, but I don't see much good it would do us.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",127
"128","7980. Is there anybody about who is cultivating finer vegetables, such as carrots and peas, or do they grow nothing but cabbages and potatoes?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",128
"129","—Well, I don't know of any garden into which they have either put carrots or peas, except one, and I daresay that is more for curiosity than for the good of it, because carrots and these vegetables do no good to a workman when he has no meat to go with them.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",129
"130","7981. Don't they make broth sometimes?",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",130
"131","—They can do that with meat.",150,"John Mclean","Raasay, Torran",131
