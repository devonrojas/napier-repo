"1","Rev. DONALD M'LEAN, Free Church Minister, Carinish (60)—examined. ",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",1
"2","12594. The Chairman.—Were you born in this country?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",2
"3","—No, I was born in Skye.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",3
"4","12595. You have been here about eleven years?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",4
"5","—Yes,",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",5
"6","12596. We have heard a great deal about the recent destitution of the people and the deterioration of their circumstances. Have you observed that of late years ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",6
"7","—Well, of course this year has been worse with them than any previous year since I came to this place, on account of the storms and tides and the failure of the harvest.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",7
"8","12597. Are you aware that any part of the poorer people are actually in want of clothing and of bedding in their houses ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",8
"9","—They are in need of clothing and of food—many of the poorer people.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",9
"10","12598. Do you think that any of the poorer people have had recourse to shell-fish and substitutes of that sort for food ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",10
"11","— Many of the poorer people are always in the way of going to the ebb for shell-fish. That is always the case.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",11
"12","12599. Do you find a great difference between the crofters and cottars ? Are the cottars much more liable to destitution ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",12
"13","—In the nature of things, the cottars must be so. There must be some difference, for the cottars have less to depend upon.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",13
"14","12600. How do you find the parochial board in their dealings with the poor ? Do you find they pay attention to their duty, or that there is a proper distribution of relief to paupers?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",14
"15","—I am not a member of the parochial board. I hear many of the paupers complaining, but I am not member of the board.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",15
"16","12601. But, not being a member of the board, you are the more capable of giving an opinion on their conduct. Do you think the allowances made are defective or sufficient ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",16
"17","—I know the allowance is bare enough. At the same time, a number of the rate-payers find the expenditure enough. ",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",17
"18","12602. Do you find that the destitute circumstances of families are such that the children are prevented from going to church or school by want of clothing?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",18
"19","—I am fully aware of that; many of them being so destitute that they can not really attend church or school for want of clothing.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",19
"20","12603. You have not been engaged in farming yourself ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",20
"21","—Not much. I have one small park.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",21
"22","12604. But you are not, in fact, personally very conversant with their agricultural condition?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",22
"23","—I cannot say that I am.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",23
"24","12605. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.—You said they were in the habit of going to the ebb for food ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",24
"25","—Yes, I think so.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",25
"26","12606. Was that also the custom in Skye where you came from ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",26
"27","—It was.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",27
"28","12607. And that custom here has never ceased ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",28
"29","—I should think not.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",29
"30","12608. Will they get wholesome food in that way ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",30
"31","—It is a help. They do not depend upon it by any means.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",31
"32","12609. What do they get ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",32
"33","—They get cockles for the most part here.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",33
"34","12610. Do they get sand eels ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",34
"35","—I am not aware of their getting them. They may, but I cannot say.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",35
"36","12611. The island of Boreray is not in your parish?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",36
"37","—No.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",37
"38","12612. Do you think the schools are properly administered here, so far as you have seen ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",38
"39","—Well, we have a good deal to do with both schools.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",39
"40","12613. One of the witnesses to-day complained that the children were not taught to read their Bible in Gaelic. Have you anything to complain of on that score ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",40
"41","—We try to supplement that. We have Gaelic schoolmasters; we have Sabbath schools, and we supplement what is not attended to in the board schools the best way we can.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",41
"42","12614. Are you able to do so satisfactorily?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",42
"43","—Well, so far; perhaps not satisfactorily, but so far as we can we try to overtake the thing.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",43
"44","12615. Would you like to see Gaelic reading taught more largely than it is in the board schools, or are there Gaelic-speaking teachers to do it ? ",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",44
"45","—We have a number of teachers who have not Gaelic. I am always pleading for the Gaelic in our schools. I pleaded for it with the school board, and I should like to see it in all our board schools.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",45
"46","12616. To what extent would you like to see it?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",46
"47","—To the extent of every child being able to read the Bible.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",47
"48","12617. Gaelic is still the chief language of the country here ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",48
"49","—Yes.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",49
"50","12618. Do they understand English ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",50
"51","—They do.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",51
"52","12619. Do you find the young people able to attend the English sermon ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",52
"53","—Most of them understand the English sermon.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",53
"54","12620. And able to read their English Bible ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",54
"55","—Yes.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",55
"56","12621. Except in this one year, you do not think the circumstances of the people are getting worse from what you first remember ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",56
"57","—There is a general complaint of the land being so much exhausted that in the nature of things the crofts cannot be so sufficient as they were in former times.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",57
"58","12622. Do you remember the time when that complaint was not made?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",58
"59","—Not in this island, of course; being so long in the island, I know it as matter of fact.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",59
"60","12623. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—Do you preach in English?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",60
"61","—Very little.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",61
"62","12624. You don't preach steadily in English?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",62
"63","—No.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",63
"64","12625. What is the number of people who generally attend your congregation ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",64
"65","—Well, this meeting house is generally about full, and at the communion season it cannot hold the people by any means. The parish is made up so much of detached islands that we must have service in various places besides here.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",65
"66","12626. How many will this building contain?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",66

"72","12629. How many people are in your parish?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",72
"73","—In the statement which I gave in to the presbytery I had Benbecula, but that is now made a separate parish. I had between 600 and 700 people including Benbecula. I should say there are now between 400 and 500. ",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",73
"74","12630. How many are there in Paible?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",74
"75","—Some 800 or 900 or more.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",75
"76","12631. Is there temporary supply at Paible ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",76

"78","12632. Are you a member or the school board ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",78
"79","—Yes.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",79
"80","12633. And you have been as yet unable to get Gaelic taught regularly?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",80
"81","—I am not aware of Gaelic being taught in any of our board schools, but we have Gaelic teachers apart from our board schools, and Sabbath schools besides.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",81
"82","12634. Suppose Gaelic were ordered to be made a special subject, would there be any difficulty in the Western Islands of getting competent teachers?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",82
"83","—No, there would not.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",83
"84","12635. And you are perfectly clear that the Gaelic-speaking children are entitled at the hands of the Government to be taught to read the Bible in their mother tongue ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",84
"85","—I think so.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",85
"86","12636. Sheriff Nicolson.—We have heard something of the persecution of Free Church people in this district, not within recent times, but in former times, though not very long ago. Do you know anything about",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",86
"87","it ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",87
"88","—I have heard of it, but really from my own observation I cannot say. There has been nothing of the kind since I came here.",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",88
"89","12637. Are there any of the delegates here who know or have experienced anything of it?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",89
"90","—I am sure they should know. ",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",90
"91","12638. Was there any place, in particular",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",91
"92","—The evictions of course took place in former times, but I cannot say they were entirely for the Church. It is possible, but I am not in a position to say that. ",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",92
"93","12639. But now-a-days I suppose there is no difference made in the terms of landlord and tenant and of neighbours between each other, on account of the church they belong to ?",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",93
"94","—No, we are on the very best of terms in that respect",221,"Rev Donald Mclean","North Uist, Loch Eport",94
