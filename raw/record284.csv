"1","MALCOLM MACKENZIE, Crofter and Fisherman, Sgigersta (71)—examined.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",1
"2","15668. The Chairman.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected a delegate by the people of Sgigersta ?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",3
"4","—Yes.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",4
"5","15669. Where is Sgigersta?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",5
"6","—It is a small township surrounded by a fence out at the back of this place here. When I was born my father and another man occupied it between them. About sixty years ago they placed twelve families there in order to prosecute the fishing. Then six of these and my own father were drowned forty-eight years ago. They got the whole township at £10 a year at that time, and now it is £80. We cannot keep but two cows each. We are surrounded by a ring fence in our township. We are seven miles from the march of Galston tack, and though none of our cattle ever went there, or ever shall, still we have had to pay 5s. 6d. a family for this fence which has been spoken of. Then they placed six other tenants upon our township within our boundary fence. This was done in Munro Mackenzie's time.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",6
"7","15670. How did it happen that the six men and your father were drowned ?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",7
"8","—The boat foundered in a storm off the shore here. There were two similar accidents since that time. The one was exactly similar, and the other was during a comparative calm.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",8
"9","15671. How long is it since the last serious accident occurred?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",9
"10","—About twenty years ago in a great drift off the shore to Sutherlandshire and Ross-shire.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",10
"11","15672. Were the boats smaller and worse in those days than they are now ?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",11
"12","—Some of them are larger and more seaworthy boats, but there are others just about the same size as those.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",12
"13","15673. We have very often heard the people say that they prefer crofting and the cultivation of the soil, to fishing ; does that depend upon the danger of the sea in any great degree ?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",13
"14","—My neighbours can make nothing of the land. Unless they take their livelihood out of the sea they cannot live at all.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",14
"15","15674. And are they deterred from prosecuting the trade of fishing generally from an apprehension of the danger?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",15
"16","—No one was ever deterred in my township by fear of consequences. The crofts in my townships are so small that they cannot be subdivided. I have myself two sons, and they have not the breadth of my palm of land.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",16
"17","15675. Was your mother alive when your father was drowned?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",17
"18","—Yes.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",18
"19","15676. Did you support her?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",19
"20","—A younger brother than I stayed in the house then. That brother was drowned since.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",20
"21","15677. Have you in your township many widows of persons who were drowned at sea?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",21
"22","—There are six alive to-day whose husbands were drowned. Of course, there were many more who are dead.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",22
"23","15678. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",23
"24","—How many families are there in your town ?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",24
"25","—Sixteen.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",25
"26","15679. Sheriff' Nicolson.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",26
"27","—How are the widows supported?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",27
"28","—They have a little land, as we ourselves have. Two of them have only half crofts. They just live as Providence bestows upon them.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",28
"29","15680. Do you know of the new port that is being built?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",29
"30","—Yes.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",30
"31","15681. Do you think it will be of great benefit to the whole neighbourhood here?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",31
"32","—If it succeeds, certainly.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",32
"33","15682. Have you any doubt about it?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",33
"34","—I cannot judge very well; only I know that the sea would be very violent there at times, but still skill will prevail.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",34
"35","15683. You have been to see the works ?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",35
"36","—No, I have not seen the works.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",36
"37","15684. Do the herring boats do any damage to the long lines of your people ?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",37
"38","—Yes, they injure them very much. My own son's lines were three times taken away this year. ",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",38
"39","15685. Were they lost?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",39
"40","—He got the lines; a neighbour got them for him. ",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",40
"41","15686. But are they sometimes carried far away?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",41
"42","—Sometimes they are lost.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",42
"43","15687. Dont you think it would be a good thing for your own men to turn herring fishers and give up the long line fishing ?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",43
"44","—They have no place to keep the boats.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",44
"45","15688. Will not the new port be a place to keep them in ?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",45
"46","—Yes.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",46
"47","15689. Is it convenient for Sgigersta as well as other places ?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",47
"48","—If all the expense that has been incurred on this port had been incurred in our place of Sgigersta, it would be a better advantage than ever could be made",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",48
"49","here.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",49
"50","15690. Will it be possible for them to prosecute the herring fishing in summer, and the long line fishing in winter and spring, after they get the new quay?  —Yes, they could, but when once these fishermen appear off the shore they may drop the ling-fishing,",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",50
"51","15691. Does it do any injury to the fish that are on the hooks when the lines are disturbed ?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",51
"52","—I believe they injure the supply of fish as well. At all events, the fishing has fallen off since my recollection.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",52
"53","15692. Is there any reason but the want of money why there should not be as fine a fleet going out from the port of Ness as from any other place ?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",53
"54","—Even with the quay it would not hold much of a fleet.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",54
"55","15693. But I suppose the men are as fit to be fishers and to compete with anybody else as those on the East coast are ?",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",55
"56","—Yes, and as brave. There are no better seamen afloat.",284,"Malcolm Mackenzie","Lewis, Ness",56
