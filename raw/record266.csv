"1","WILLIAM MACKAY, Chamberlain on the Lewis estatesâ€”re-examined.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",1
"2","14946. The Chairman.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",2
"3","â€”You wish, I believe, to make a statement to us? ",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",3
"4","â€”Yes, I do so, in the way of accounting for the small number of what I call squatters or cottars that appear in the statement I have to make. I am speaking of 1881. In opening a new rent ledger, I entered the names of squatters and cottars who had been about ten or fifteen or twenty years as such paying rent, not directly to the landlord, but to the crofter, though perhaps both of them would appear at the rent collection day. That led to trouble and sometimes confusion. I entered the whole of them in our ledger. The number now in the rent-roll in the parish of Barvas is 812.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",4
"5","14947. Paying directly to the landlord ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",5
"6","â€”Yes.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",6
"7","14948. Mr Cameron.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",7
"8","â€”And they were cottars before?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",8
"9","â€”They were squatters.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",9
"10","14949. The Chairman.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",10
"11","â€”About how many were admitted at that time?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",11
"12","â€”Probably about one-third of 812. Since 1881 up to this date I find there are eighty-seven squatters or sub-tenants.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",12
"13","14950. Mr Cameron.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",13
"14","â€”These are not entered in the rent-roll?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",14
"15","â€”No.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",15
"16","14951. The Chairman.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",16
"17","â€”Have they all built their houses since 1881?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",17
"18","â€”Yes, so far as known to me. The rental of the 812 crofters is Â£2330, 4s. 6d., or an average of Â£2, 17s. 4d. per crofter.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",18
"19","14952. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",19
"20","â€”Have you included in the list all under Â£30 of rent ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",20
"21","â€”Â£30 and under. I may explain, that in comparing the rent of the present day with that of 1844, there is a considerable increase of rent in this parish, on account of land reclaimed by the landlord. That land was let to a number of the people in this district and towards Ness at a rent of 2s. 6d. per acre for the first five years; 5s. for the second five years; and 7s. 6d. for the third five years, with interest on the outlay for improvements. The first and second rises were charged, but not the third. ",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",21
"22","14953. So it remains at 5s. ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",22
"23","â€”Yes, with interest on improvements. It was the belief that by this outlay we could make arable land or crofts for crofters, by which they could live independent of the moor pasture. The lots were originally given out, perhaps, six or seven acres in extent, but they are now of course by subdivision reduced to much less than that.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",23
"24","14954. Mr Cameron.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",24
"25","â€”At what date were the improvements made?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",25
"26","â€”From 1849 to 1852 inclusive.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",26
"27","14955. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",27
"28","â€”Were the leases to be for fifteen years ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",28
"29","â€”For fifteen years. There have been so many changes by the reclaiming of this land, which is attached to the former townships, that I cannot compare one township to-day with the township in 1844 as to the rent, to show the increase.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",29
"30","14956. The Chairman.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",30
"31","â€”You can only show the gross increase on the whole parish ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",31
"32","â€”Yes. The area of the parish of Barvas, in which we now are, is 85,043 acres. That is exclusive of water. I deduct glebes, manses, manse sites, and churches, which amount to 940 acres. The only farm in this parish is Galston, 7290 acres; lands attached to the mill at Dell, 160 acres; leaving 76,653 acres under crofters paying Â£ 3 0 and under, divided among 812 crofters paying rent. They pay a rent of Â£2330, 4s. 6d., or at the rate of 7Â¼d. per acre, arable and hill pasture. Galston farm, containing 7290 acres, at a rental of Â£315, 9s. 6d. gives 10Â¼d. per acre. The 160 acres attached to the mill at Dell is rented at Â£88. The crofters stock in 1882 consisted of 3421 head of cattle, 13,795 head of sheep, 580 horses, and 285 pigs. The tacksman's stock for the same period was 71 head of cattle, 1643 sheep, 6 horses, and 2 pigs. I give the stock of 1881, because it is somewhat larger. Crofters : 3591 head of cattle, 14,238 head of sheep, 549 horses, 300 pigs. Tacksman, 47 head of cattle, 1716 head of sheep, 4 horses, and 4 pigs.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",32
"33","14957. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",33
"34","â€”Do these include young and old?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",34
"35","â€”Yes.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",35
"36","14958. At what time was the enumeration?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",36
"37","â€”About the end of September or 1st of October. It is taken annually.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",37
"38","14959. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",38
"39","â€”Have you any idea of the number of acres that were reclaimed by Sir James Matheson in those three years you have referred to ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",39
"40","â€”No, but I can get the information.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",40
"41","14960. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",41
"42","â€”And the sum expended?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",42
"43","â€”Possibly I may.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",43
"44","14961. The Chairman.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",44
"45","â€”Would you describe the nature of the reclamation?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",45
"46","â€”Trenching and draining.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",46
"47","14962. Were there main drains made to evacuate the general water?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",47
"48","â€”Yes.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",48
"49","14963. And then were there underground drains cut, or were there merely surface drains all over the surface?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",49
"50","â€”I cannot speak definitely just now, for I was not seeing it at the time. My object to-day is merely to simplify mattersâ€”to show that there are new townships, and that there is only one tacksman and the miller.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",50
"51","14964. Mr Cameron.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",51
"52","â€”What became of the eighty-seven squatters? Are they entered on the rental ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",52
"53","â€”Not the eighty-seven.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",53
"54","14965. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",54
"55","â€”Do you think they were overlooked by you ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",55
"56","â€”They might be overlooked, and they have increased since then. There were two families perhaps that have gone out and built a separate house since I made the entries. ",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",56
"57","14966. The Chairman.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",57
"58","â€”As regards the area of this improvement by Sir James, was it taken from the common pasture of pre-existing townships ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",58
"59","â€”It was attached to pre-existing townships, but both the old and new townships were lotted and rented in 1850 and 1851, and valued according to what they were worth then with these crofters upon them. ",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",59
"60","14967. When these new lots were formed and improved by Sir James, were the new crofters placed there admitted to the privileges of hill pasture formerly enjoyed by the others?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",60
"61","â€”Yes.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",61
"62","14968. Was that very extensive?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",62
"63","â€”In some parts of the parish it was very extensive, but not at the extreme Butt, towards the point of Ness.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",63
"64","14969. Has the rental of 5s. per acre on the inproved ground been easily and punctually paid ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",64
"65","â€”No, there is a considerable amount of arrears in this parish.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",65
"66","14970. Did the improvement turn out well? As regards the improvement of the soil did it answer expectation or fall short of expectation ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",66
"67","â€”I believe it was a mistake; I don't think it is possible to have an arable farm in the Lewis that will pay. Even the proprietor cannot make his manor farm pay as an arable farm.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",67
"68","14971. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",68
"69","â€”But that is no test; no home farm ever pays ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",69
"70","â€”No, but there is not an arable farm, properly speaking, in the Lewis, except one or two near Stornoway, and their great stay is dairy produce for the town.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",70
"71","14972. The Chairman.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",71
"72","â€”But these improved farms were not solely arable farms, because they had rights of hill pasture also ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",72
"73","â€”Yes.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",73
"74","14973. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie. ",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",74
"75","â€”Have you any idea what the rent per acre came to, including the interest and the 5s. ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",75
"76","â€”There were some of them up to Â£ 5 and Â£6 for the croft altogether.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",76
"77","14974. But can you tell us what was the rent of the improved croft per acre ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",77
"78","â€”I believe some of the land would be close on 20s. per acre, with the 5s. and the interest.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",78
"79","14975. Not more than that?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",79
"80","â€”Not more than that.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",80
"81","14976. Mr Cameron.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",81
"82","â€”What rate of interest was charged ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",82
"83","â€”I am not certain as to that.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",83
"84","14977. The Chairman.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",84
"85","â€”Has the capital expended been all reimbursed ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",85
"86","â€”It has, but all this was not done by Government drainage.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",86
"87","14978. No, but still the capital expended has been reimbursed?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",87
"88","â€”Yes.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",88
"89","14979. Then was it understood that when the capital was reimbursed, the rental was to be correspondingly reduced, or was it to continue at the increased rate?â€”Well, I cannot say as to what arrangement was made, but it has been continued on the forms when the leases were outâ€”principally upon the large arable farms about Stornoway and Galston. ",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",89
"90","14980. But with reference to these improved crofters' lands?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",90
"91","â€”There was no change made.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",91
"92","14981. That is to say; they continued to pay as rent the 5s. per acre, plus the whole of the charge for interest and reimbursement of capital ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",92
"93","â€”They continue to pay the same rent as in 1853 or 1854, when the improvements were completed.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",93
"94","14982. Mr Cameron.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",94
"95","â€”Can you say whether the rate of interest charged was 6Â½ per cent. ?",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",95
"96","â€”I am not sure of that.",266,"William Mackay","Lewis, Barvas ",96
