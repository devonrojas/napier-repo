"1","MURDO M'LEAN, Crofter, Lealt (60)—examined. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",1
"2","2654. The Chairman.",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",2
"3","—How long have you been a crofter?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",3
"4","—It is not long since I got my croft. My father was in it before me, but not in my present croft. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",4
"5","2655. Have you been freely elected a delegate ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",5
"6","—Yes, ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",6
"7","2656. What are the particular hardships of which the people in your place complain?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",7
"8","—The smallness of our holdings, heavy rents, and the insecurity of tenure. We are marching with another property, Lord Macdonald's, and no march between us but a small burn. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",8
"9","2657. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",9
"10","—Are you close to Valtos?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",10
"11","—Three townships lie between us and Valtos. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",11
"12","2658. The Chairman.",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",12
"13","—Has any common pasture been taken away from your place ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",13
"14","—Yes. Two lots of the township were cut off us, and the best part of the grass, and another piece of arable land that the township had in common with others near the shore, and which was of much service to us, because we had ware connected with it. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",14
"15","2659. Have you no sea-ware now?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",15
"16","—No, we cannot reach it. We live on the far end of a peat moss",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",16
"17","—the four lots which have been left to the township. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",17
"18","2660. Is there any other complaint in your place ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",18
"19","—We are without a roadway there, through the country or to the sea-shore. At this time of the year, when the weather is good, and the sea fine, we can get our goods conveyed by boats; but in winter we have to travel 14 miles over the hill for the necessaries for our families, and we have to carry everything on our backs over the hill without roads or bridges,—over rivers; and sometimes people are lost in these burns. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",19
"20","2661. Sheriff Nicolson.",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",20
"21","—Do you know of any instance?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",21
"22","—Several years ago a person was lost in one of these burns. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",22
"23","2662. In speaking of the distance of 14 miles do you refer to Portree?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",23
"24","—Yes. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",24
"25","2663. How far are you from Stenscholl ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",25
"26","—About 6 miles. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",26
"27","2664. Can you carry anything from here to Lealt except on your backs ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",27
"28","—If we had a horse, we could carry our necessaries on horseback; if we had carts, we could take them to the march of Valtos. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",28
"29","2665. How far is it from Valtos?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",29
"30","—About 2½  miles. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",30
"31","2666. What school do your children go to ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",31
"32","—Valtos, ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",32
"33","2667. Do the children attend well ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",33
"34","—Those who are strong. We have no road. In winter, when the burns are swollen, they cannot attend. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",34
"35","2668. Does the compulsory officer ever come near you?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",35
"36","—Yes. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",36
"37","2669. How often?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",37
"38","—Occasionally. He comes pretty often. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",38
"39","2670. Are the people in a poorer condition than they were some years ago ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",39
"40","—Yes, getting poorer yearly. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",40
"41","2671. Is there any fishing at your place ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",41
"42","—No. I believe fish could be got if the sea were accessible. . ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",42
"43","2672. Is there no port on your coast?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",43
"44","—No port. There is no safe place to haul up the boats between this bay and Portree. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",44
"45","2673. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",45
"46","—Could this place be improved very much by a quay for the safety of fishing boats ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",46
"47","—Yes, and possibly nearer Portree than this. I have seen quays made in wilder places. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",47
"48","2674. Could a quay be made here in Loch Staffin, for a comparatively moderate sum, that would stand the weather ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",48
"49","—I cannot say about that. I have no idea what such work would cost. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",49
"50","2675. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",50
"51","—You say the people are getting poorer year by year. Is there more than one cause for it ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",51
"52","—Yes. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",52
"53","2676. How many causes do you attribute it to?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",53
"54","—To the smallness of our holdings and the inconvenience and difficulty of access to the place. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",54
"55","2677. But that last has been always in existence ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",55
"56","—I believe it is attributable very much to the excess of rent. Before the rent was increased upon us we were in pretty good circumstances. Since that time, unless each year will meet the expenditure of that particular year, we have to encroach upon our stock, little by little, until the stock is exhausted. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",56
"57","2678. Have you anything to say of the badness of the seasons, as regards fishings, or as regards crops? ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",57
"58","—Last year, I believe, has occasioned considerable loss, for the crop was lost by storm. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",58
"59","2679. That is the only season you think worse than former times?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",59
"60","—I don't remember such a bad year as last year. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",60
"61","2680. There are only four tenants at Lealt now. Do you remember the time when there were fewer?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",61
"62","—There are seven families located on these four lots. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",62
"63","2681. Where did they come from ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",63
"64","—I believe they belong to the place. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",64
"65","2682. They were born in it ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",65
"66","—Yes. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",66
"67","2683. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",67
"68","—Were you at one time in comfortable circumstances?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",68
"69","—Yes, I was in circumstances at one time that no man could crave me for 1s. of debt. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",69
"70","2684. Is that a considerable time since ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",70
"71","—Fifteen or twenty years ago. ",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",71
"72","2685. Were you some years io that position ?",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",72
"73","—Before then I was always comfortable.",43,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Stenscholl",73
