"2","342. The Chairman.",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",2
"3","—Are you a crofter?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",3
"4","—I never got a croft. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",4
"5","343. Are you a cottar?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",5
"6","—Yes, I am a cottar at Achnahaunait. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",6
"7","344. Are you a fishermen ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",7

"10","—Yes. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",10
"11","346. Have you any remarks which you wish to add to what they have said?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",11
"12","—I want to say that it is the want of land, and the dearness of it that is leaving the people so poor. My own great-grandfather was tenant in Achnahannait, and had a fourth part of it to himself. My grandfather succeeded him, and hada fifth part of Achnahannait. My father succeeded my grandfather, and had an eighth part of the land, and in his lifetime lie came to be reduced to a sixteenth of the land. My father had six sons, of whom I am the eldest, and not one of them would get a sod from Lord Macdonald. Only the youngest of them was left with his mother, and is not that a great reason for the poverty of the people ? ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",12
"13","347. How have you supported your family ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",13
"14","—As best I could, working day and night sometimes. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",14
"15","348. In whose employment have you worked,—in the employment of the landlord or in the employment of the crofters ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",15
"16","—Working not much in the Isle of Skye, but earning wages elsewhere. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",16
"17","349. When you were a young man working in the Isle of Skye, what were your daily wages?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",17

"19","350. And what are the wages now?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",19
"20","—I am not very sure what the wages are going now for I am seeing very little work going on at all. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",20
"21","351. Are you quite sure that you received 2s. a day twenty years ago ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",21
"22","— I am sure I was working at a shilling a day at that time. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",22
"23","352. What are the wages that able-bodied young men are now getting for common work ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",23
"24","—About 2s. 6d. I think ; that is the wage that I got from a farmer for a day's work in spring. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",24
"25","353. You spoke of the gradual subdivision of the land for three generations, what caused the subdivision ? was it the multiplication of families, or were there other families brought from outside and put upon the land?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",25
"26","—Both causes went together. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",26

"30","355. Who succeeded your father to the croft ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",30
"31","—My mother is still alive and my youngest brother. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",31
"32","356. Who is the eldest of the family ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",32
"33","—Myself. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",33
"34","357. Then you will succeed your mother eventually?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",34
"35","—It is not my mother. It is my step-mother. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",35
"36","358. Do you ever expect to get the croft ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",36
"37","—I have no expectations of getting the croft. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",37
"38","359. How many brothers had you ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",38

"46","363. Who put up the house ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",46
"47","—I built the house myself. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",47
"48","364. Did you get leave from the factor to build the house?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",48
"49","—I got leave from the township. I did not ask the leave of the factor. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",49
"50","365. Did the factor not object?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",50
"51","—No, he never said anything to me about it. I got a bit of ground from the township, for which I pay 30s. to the township. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",51
"52","366. Does not the factor object when this is done on the township by other people?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",52
"53","—I cannot say. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",53
"54","367. May anybody build a house who makes arrangements with the township ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",54
"55","—No. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",55
"56","368. Who was the factor at that time?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",56
"57","—M'Kinnon of Corrie. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",57
"58","369. Was he very easy about the time?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",58
"59","—No, he was not very easy. We had not much to say in his praise. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",59
"60","370. But what I meant to ask was, did he interfere with anybody putting up a house upon the township without any land,—making their own arrangements with the township?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",60
"61","—Corrie would be finding fault with the crofters for doing that—for allowing outsiders to build houses.",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",61
"62","371. Do you know why he did not find fault with you fordoing it?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",62
"63","— I cannot be very sure ; but I was paying the one-third of the rent of a croft before then, and the factor put me out of that in order to divide the croft into two halves. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",63
"64","372. How did you have to pay rent for this croft? How did you get hold of the croft ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",64
"65","—My mother-in-law gave mo the one-third of the lot when I was married. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",65
"66","373. Would this building of houses without land on the township be allowed now under the present factor?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",66
"67","—Not without his own order.",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",67
"68","374. But does he often allow these houses to be built?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",68
"69","—l am not aware, but in the last instance I have seen the house could not be built without the order of the factor. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",69
"70","375. But I want to know as to whether these houses are built at the present day without the order of the factor ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",70

"81","380. How long does it keep you and your family alive ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",81
"82","—Not very long—shorter than I would need to. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",82
"83","381. Then, when you are not away working, of course you have no means of subsistence?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",83
"84","—No, I have no means of supporting myself but for the help of two daughters I have. My wife has been for the past ten years an invalid, and is now confined to bed. I sent two applications, signed by myself and my neighours, to the parochial board for aid, but I was not allowed any. The reply to my application was—Her children were to support her. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",84
"85","382. Have you any sons ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",85
"86","—No. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",86
"87","383. Who was chairman of the parochial board ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",87
"88","—The factor, I have been told. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",88

"93","—You don't look well; what is the matter with you ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",93
"94","—I got my trouble bringing sea-ware from Raasay. Our boat foundered, coming with a load of sea-weed from Raasay, and I was two or three hours in the sea. That was the commencement of my ailment. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",94
"95","386. How old are you ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",95
"96","—A little over fifty years of age. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",96

"102","389. The Chairman.",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",102
"103","—You stated you had built your own house and acquired a small piece of ground, and paid your rent to the township. Your rent is 30s. When a man hires his land from the township, does he generally pay a higher rent than he would if he paid it to the landlord ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",103

"111","393. What was the cost of erecting the house ?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",111
"112","—I do not know what the house would cost to build, if I had others to pay for building it, but I built it myself without expenditure of money. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",112

"123","399. Have you no neighbours?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",123

"132","403. You said you got £ 1 worth of the timber for the roof, but that did not include the doors and windows?",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",132

"147","—I believe there is a full acre in it; but it includes bits of heathery ground—stony pieces. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",147

"149","— I am sure it is too high. ",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",149

"162","—I cannot tell.",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",162
"163","416. The Chairman.",7,"John Mathieson","Skye, Braes",163
