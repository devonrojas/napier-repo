"1","JOHN M'KINNON, Cottar, Glen, and formerly Crofter in Tangasdale (69)—examined.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",1
"2","10470. The Chairman.—Have you been freely elected a delegate?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",2
"3","—Yes, by the people of Tangasdale.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",3
"4","10471. Have you a statement to make on their behalf?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",4
"5","—Yes. I have to say that they lost their land, the one-third of the township, and other land was promised to them for it, but they did not get it.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",5
"6","10472. Do you mean they lost their land in Tangasdale?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",6
"7","—Yes, the onethird of their land was taken from them, and they were told they would get other land for it, but that promise was not redeemed.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",7
"8","10473. How long ago was that ?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",8
"9","—Sixteen years ago. After the rent was paid I was put out at the end of a month. They have lost their means.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",9
"10","The land is dear.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",10
"11","10474. Are you on the proprietor's lands or the tacksman's lands?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",11
"12","—On the crofters' lands.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",12
"13","10475. How do you earn your subsistence?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",13
"14","—By day's wages from any person from whom I can get it.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",14
"15","10476. Do you get employment from the farmer?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",15
"16","—I get work from Mr M'Neill, merchant here. I never went to seek employment from the large tacksmen.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",16
"17","10477. What are your wages?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",17
"18","—2s. and sometimes 2s. 6d. a day.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",18
"19","10478. What description of work are you employed at?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",19
"20","—Curing fish.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",20
"21","10479. How long does that sort of work last during the year ?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",21
"22","—Generally half the year.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",22
"23","10480. What do you do the other half ?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",23
"24","—The rest of the year I work about his own house.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",24
"25","10481. At the same wages?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",25
"26","—No, the day is short then.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",26
"27","10482. How much then?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",27
"28","—1s. 6d.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",28
"29","10483. When you were young, what wages would you have got for the same description of work ?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",29
"30","—I was not at that kind of work when I was a young man. I had land of my own then.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",30
"31","10484. But in the case of other people who did the same kind of work, how much did they get?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",31
"32","—The highest was 1s. 6d., 1s., and so on.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",32
"33","10485. When you were young, were meal and other commodities dearer or cheaper than they are now?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",33
"34","—Meal was dearer then than it is now, but there was no meal imported at that time. We did not need it. Plenty grew upon the land. When the men had planted the land, there was as much growing to them as would support them in meal.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",34
"35","10486. Is there more money circulating now, in consequence of the increase of fishing?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",35

"44","—The tacksman that left Vatersay got it,—Mr Archibald M'Lellan.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",44
"45","10490. Why was it taken from them and given to him?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",45

"47","10491. Was there any reduction of rent made at the time?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",47
"48","—No abatement of rent. We were promised additional land in exchange for it, which we did not get, but the rent remains upon the township still the same as it was before.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",48
"49","10492. Can you give us any idea how many acres were taken away from them in this way?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",49

"55","10495. Did they represent this grievance to him?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",55
"56","—No.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",56
"57","10496. Why not?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",57
"58","—We would not get it any way—even supposing we asked it ; but I was broken down, and did not like to make much of a row about it.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",58
"59","10497. Were you and your co-crofters afraid that if you made a disturbance you would be put out altogether?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",59
"60","—Certainly.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",60
"61","10498. You stated in answer to his Lordship in the chair, that they did not import much meal in your younger days. Was there a mill in old times?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",61
"62","—There is a mill yet at the other end of the island. ",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",62
"63","10499. Is there much doing at the mill now?—As much as is sent to it, and it could grind as much as would feed the whole island.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",63
"64","10500. Is there much meal ground at the mill ?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",64
"65","—No, there is not so much meal ground as would keep the mill going one day in the week. All the meal is imported.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",65
"66","10501. Has the principal tacksman, Dr M'Gillivray, a good deal of arable land under cultivation ?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",66
"67","—Oh, plenty of it; I may say he has the half of Barra, and he cultivated a good deal of it.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",67
"68","10502. And, notwithstanding all that, there is only work for the mill how one day in the week?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",68
"69","—It does not get the one-sixth it could grind. The meal comes from Glasgow.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",69
"70","10503. Are the crofters generally, as we have heard in parts of Skye, getting poorer and deteriorating in their circumstances ?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",70
"71","—Yes, they are. The land is so small, and it is getting inferior by continuous cropping. The people are getting poorer, ",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",71
"72","10504. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",72

"77","10506. Did you lose your croft in Tangasdale altogether, because you came to poverty ?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",77
"78","—No, the croft was taken from me to be given to a policeman whom they brought into the place. It was not because of poverty that I was deprived of it, but through injustice.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",78
"79","10507. Were you in arrears when you were turned out ?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",79
"80","—I brought home , some money after paying the rent; I had no arrears.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",80
"81","10508. Then you did not wish to give up the croft?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",81
"82","—No, it was taken from me in order to be given to the policeman. The policeman selected mine rather than that of any one else in the township, and of course he must needs get it.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",82
"83","10509. Was the choice given to the policeman?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",83
"84","—Probably that was the case. At any rate, he fixed his eye upon mine.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",84
"85","10510. The Chairman.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",85
"86","Who was the factor at that time?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",86

"88","10511. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",88
"89","—Was it because it was a good croft that it was taken from you ?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",89

"91","10512. Did you get any compensation ?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",91
"92","—Nothing was given to me. The rent was paid, and there was nothing due by me.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",92
"93","10513. Did you get any compensation for your houses ?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",93
"94","—I left the houses with them; they were of no use to me.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",94
"95","10514. Professor Mackinnon.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",95
"96","Are you as well off now as a day-worker as your neighbours whom you left behind you in Tangasdale are as crofters ?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",96
"97","—Not by any means.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",97

"107","—Yes.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",107
"108","10519. All of them ?",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",108
"109","—Yes. One of them goes to the east coast fishing, and they assist her too when the fishing is going on.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",109

"119","—Yes I paid him £ 3 . It is a small house.",178,"John Mckinnon","Barra, Castlebay",119
