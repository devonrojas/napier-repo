"1","ANGUS MACARTHUR, Crofter, Kirkibost, Bernera (55)—examined.",248,"Angus Macarthur","Lewis, Meavaig",1
"2","14053. The Chairman.",248,"Angus Macarthur","Lewis, Meavaig",2
"3","—Were you freely elected a delegate ?",248,"Angus Macarthur","Lewis, Meavaig",3
"4","—Yes.",248,"Angus Macarthur","Lewis, Meavaig",4
"5","14054. Have you any statement to make on the part of the people of Kirkibost ?",248,"Angus Macarthur","Lewis, Meavaig",5
"6","—Yes. We were formerly at Bosta, in the north end of the island, and all the lots in that part of the island, when I was there, were rented at £3, 10s. When I left it the rent I paid was £4, 17s. 6d. There were twenty-two families in the township, of whom twelve were in the rental book. We were so crowded there that we did not know what to do. The cottars that were with us there were in such a state that they reduced us to the same state as themselves. We then spoke to the tacksman on the south side of the island, Mr Macdonald, to make an exchange with us, and when Mr Mackenzie and Mr Mackay heard of it they met with us here at Meavaig. The exchange we wanted could not be made, but we were to get Kirkibost, which Mr Mackenzie had. When we removed to Kirkibost the whole stock we had was reduced in the proportion of five to three of the sheep, and there was one year kept from us of the cattle. The place we had was so dear that we had two meetings with Mr Mackay, and we were refusing to take the summing he was putting upon us. We then went home and put our heads together, and determined to send two of us to Stornoway to see Mr Mackay, and get relieved from the summing he was putting upon us, and I was one of the two. We argued with him how small the summing was. He would give us no more, and so we took what he offered. Wre came that year to Kirkibost. It had been fifty-seven years fallow, and we were taking in the ground during the whole winter, and we did not get one stone of meal of assistance. We were wanting also the island which had formerly belonged to Kirkibost, but we could not get it, and we understood also that £20 had been added to the rent of it, which Mr Macaulay had been paying before. (See Appendix A, XLI) We had been paying £48 of rent in Bosta, and in Kirkibost £120, and we have not a foot of hill pasture on that island more than we had before at Bosta. When we were at Bosta we had to erect a dyke between ourselves and the forest, and we could not put a beast upon it till that dyke was made, the extent of which was calculated to be from five to six miles. We took ashore our boats, ou which we lived, and all the men and women had to go and work at that dyke. One shilling a yard was promised us for making that dyke, and we never got anything for it. It was also promised that a paling should be erected ou the top of the wall, which was never done. We have not been allowed to send our cattle or sheep to the pasture enclosed by that wall. That was pasture we got in exchange from Sir James. He took our former summer pasture from us, and we got this pasture in exchange.",248,"Angus Macarthur","Lewis, Meavaig",6
