"1","JOHN MACLEOD, Boat-Builder, Ness (35)—examined.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",1
"2","15887. The Chairman.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",2
"3","—How long have you been established here?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",3
"4","—I have been here all my days.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",4
"5","15888. Are you a native of Ness?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",5
"6","—Yes.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",6
"7","15889. Mr Cameron",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",7
"8","—Have you any dealings with the people besides those in your immediate neighbourhood?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",8
"9","—No, I am just a boat-builder, and supply fishermen with boats.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",9
"10","15890. How many do you build in a year?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",10
"11","—Sometimes I used to build six or seven.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",11
"12","15891. Has your trade been getting better or falling off?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",12
"13","—It has been something about the same for a good while back.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",13
"14","15892. Do you build these boats for the fishermen ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",14
"15","—Yes.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",15
"16","15893. Then I gather from that that they all use their own boats?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",16
"17","—Yes ; they all use boats that are built at the port or at Stornoway.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",17
"18","15894. You do not build for Stornoway people?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",18
"19","—Sometimes.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",19
"20","15895. Are those included in the six or seven?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",20
"21","—That depends on the number of boat-builders that are together. It will give enough to one man to build these.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",21
"22","15S96. But as a rule the boats are built for the fishermen and not for the curers ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",22
"23","—For both.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",23
"24","15897. Do you build as many for the curers as for the fishermen?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",24
"25","—More for the curers.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",25
"26","15898. Then the custom is that the fish-curers own the boats?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",26
"27","—Yes; they buy the boats of us.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",27
"28","15899. What are the terms between the fish-curers and the crews of the boats ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",28
"29","—They give them the boats on three years' shares. The boat comes to £30, and that is £10 a year for three seasons. If the crew can clear it off in three seasons, the boat is theirs ; but if not, it is the property of the curer.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",29
"30","15900. Do they get a chance again?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",30
"31","—Yes, if they are engaged to fish for the curer.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",31
"32","15901. Is that agreement independent of any agreement between the curer and the crew as to catching fish?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",32
"33","—Yes.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",33
"34","15902. There are separate agreements?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",34
"35","—Yes, that is a separate agreement. They have another agreement for the ling.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",35
"36","15903. What is that agreement?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",36
"37","—That the curer shall pay so much per hug from this date until 6th July or whatever it is, and the settlement will be in November.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",37
"38","15904. Are the crews of the boats expected to take provisions from the fish-curers, or do they get the price in money ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",38
"39","—They are independent of that if they like. They need not go to the curer if they don't like. The curer is bound to pay them.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",39
"40","15905. We saw three boats on the shore here; are these the boats that cost only £30 each?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",40
"41","—Yes, the shell of them and the ropes and mast, but not including the sail.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",41
"42","15906. What would the sail cost?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",42
"43","—£8",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",43
"44","15907. And the tackle necessary for fishing?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",44
"45","—The boat cannot go out without lines. The total cost is about £42 or £43.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",45
"46","15908. You are talking of the ling fishing ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",46
"47","—Yes.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",47
"48","15909. They do not require nets for the ling fishing ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",48
"49","—No.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",49
"50","15910. You have had a good deal to do with the movement which resulted in the construction of the port here ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",50
"51","—Yes.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",51
"52","15911. How many boats of that size will that port contain when it is completed ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",52
"53","—Not more than twenty-five or thirty. The excavation is too small.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",53
"54","15912. They are to excavate to the depth of about ten feet ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",54
"55","—It will be thirteen feet nine inches, but it is only a small boat that it can accommodate.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",55
"56","15913. What are they going to do with the boulders and rocks that are in the way ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",56
"57","—There are no rocks in the way.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",57
"58","15914. But the harbour will embrace some rocks?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",58
"59","—Yes. The breakwater is going up on them. They are going to run the pier on the top of them,",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",59
"60","15915. Are they going to blast away any of the rocks?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",60
"61","—Yes, they must blast when they are excavating to that depth.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",61
"62","15916. And you think it will be a considerable benefit to the fishing population ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",62
"63","—I know it will.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",63
"64","15917. Would it have been better if it had been larger?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",64
"65","—A great deal. If I had £40,000 to-day I would put it into it, and I would be sure of it being paid back very soon. That is how I would build it, for the locality is too poor to expect anything out of it. I would lay out the money in that way and charge dues. They could go east or west from such a harbour—from Carloway to Cape Wrath.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",65
"66","15918. How many boats are going round there?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",66
"67","—A good many hundreds at this time of the year.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",67
"68","15919. Are many of the boats there now?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",68
"69","—I don't know how many are at Stornoway now.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",69
"70","15920. Are the most of the people in this place fishermen?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",70
"71","—Yes. These are the ling fishermen—the men who are depending on this harbour.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",71
"72","15921. Do the Stornoway boats intend to come into this harbour when it is made ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",72
"73","—Yes, it would do for them to come into if it was larger. It could be made larger. I was round the place with the engineer, and I know the route well enough.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",73
"74","15922. At any future time, if they found the harbour not large enough, could they extend it and make it larger according to the plan ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",74
"75","—Yes, and they could have a deep-water harbour.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",75
"76","15923. In fact they could extend the present harbour in case they wanted to do so?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",76
"77","—Yes.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",77
"78","15924. I suppose there are hundreds of boats at Stornoway?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",78
"79","—Yes.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",79
"80","15925. Would a large portion of these boats like to use this harbour when the fishing happens to be here ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",80
"81","—Yes, I believe they would.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",81
"82","15926. Do you think the people here are as well off as they were some years ago?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",82
"83","—No, I do not. When I remember first they would take notice of a man whom they saw on the street that was in debt to the curers, and now you cannot see a man without that, except very very few.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",83
"84","15927. And when they see a man not in debt do they point him out now ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",84
"85","—They can put their finger on every one to-day. It is due to the bad seasons and bad fishing and the system of working they have in the ling fishing. They have to go out and set their lines, and they have a big stone at the end of the lines and a rope up to the top of the water with a buoy. So when the herring boats come they are setting their own nets, and these are drifted and they carry away the lines. ",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",85
"86","15928. Then you agree with what was said by the previous witnesses that the ling fishing has been considerably damaged by the herring boats ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",86
"87","—I agree with that. I believe that the herring fishing and ling fishing cannot be done in the same place. It ought to be done in the way of winter ling fishing and summer herring fishing. ",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",87
"88","15929. To what other cause do you attribute the poverty among the fishermen ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",88
"89","—That seems the great cause. It is a very good boat that takes 1000 ling this year. I remember when they were taking 6000.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",89
"90","15930. Do you think there are as many fish on the coast now as there used to be ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",90
"91","—I cannot go into that at all",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",91
"92","15931. There is nothing else you can suggest, except that the herring boats should do less damage to the ling fishers, and that the harbour should be larger?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",92
"93","—My suggestion is that a large harbour should be built here, and that they should get large boats as their neighbours do from the east coast. All these men have to go to the east coast, and must be under masters who can do with them as they like, engaging them at such a price as they can give them, and they have not even one net of their own.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",93
"94","15932. What do these men generally bring home in a fair year from the east coast ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",94
"95","—I have seen them coming home with from £5 to £20; and some of them with less than £5 some years.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",95
"96","15933. Sheriff Nicolson.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",96
"97","—Last year was a bad year, I suppose?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",97
"98","—Yes, according to the fishing. They are just taking them at so much per cran.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",98
"99","15934. Mr Cameron.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",99
"100","—Do you think the people here are suited more for fishermen than for farmers ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",100
"101","—I think they are more suitable for fishermen than for farmers. They cannot do both, and it is at the same time that both things should be prosecuted.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",101
"102","15935. And you would like to see them stick more at home rather than go to the east coast ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",102
"103","—Yes, for I see all these fishermen on the east coast, and I know a few of them.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",103
"104","15936. There are none of them farmers on the east coast?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",104
"105","—No; they may just have an acre or so as a garden.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",105
"106","15937. The Chairman.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",106
"107","—Do you mean to say that you think the fishermen ought to have no land at all or that they ought to have land enough for one or two cows ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",107
"108","—That is my idea. I am sure that fishing and farming cannot be done together.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",108
"109","15938. But ought they to have land for one or two cows, or do you think.they should have no land at all?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",109
"110","—Well, I should like them to have a garden.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",110
"111","15939. But not a cow's grass?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",111
"112","—If they could keep one cow it would be a great benefit to them.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",112
"113","15940. From what funds is the work at the harbour being carried on?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",113
"114","—Lady Matheson gave £1500 and the Fishery Board gave £4500.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",114
"115","15941. Do you know whether any application was made to the Board in London for funds ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",115
"116","—Yes ; I know there was.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",116
"117","15942. You made an application to the Public Wrorks Loans Commission?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",117
"118","—No, but I wrote a letter to Mr Gladstone for it.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",118
"119","15943. But you are aware there is a Board which advances money for public improvements, called the Public Works Loans Board?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",119
"120","—I know there is a Loans Board.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",120
"121","15944. Was there any application made to it?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",121
"122","—I don't think so.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",122
"123","15945. You say it would have been better to make the harbour much larger, and to make it a deep-water harbour. In case the harbour was ever enlarged thereafter, would the present work be useless and thrown away, or could the present work be made useful towards a larger harbour ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",123
"124","—The present work need not be thrown away at all, and I was very much pleased when I saw from the plans that they could make a continuation of a large harbour. ",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",124
"125","15946. Do you think that the present work will stand; is it substantial ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",125
"126","—Well I do not know. I doubt it very much—this piece they are making just now,—for it is just a piece they are running on the front out to the sea, and there is not a back to it. That is the worst I saw about the plan, and I objected to it the moment I saw it.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",126
"127","15947. You mean that the present wall at right angles to the shore is not sufficiently supported ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",127
"128","—I think not.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",128
"129","15948. How ought it to be supported?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",129
"130","—If there was another one at the back of it, and a hearting, and a parapet the same as the rest of it, it would be sufficient to stand the waves ; for the out-sweep of the sea here is stronger than at any place the Stevensons saw in their life, and I am afraid it will take the corner of the outer pier out.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",130
"131","15949. At all tides the boats will not be able to get in?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",131
"132","—No; not with the present wall.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",132
"133","15950. Would they be able to come in under your plan for a larger harbour?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",133
"134","—Yes there is five feet of water at lowest spring water according to my plan.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",134
"135","15951. What do these big boats draw?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",135
"136","—I do not know very well, but I think eight feet will do well enough.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",136
"137","15952. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",137
"138","—Who is looking after this part of the Matheson property ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",138
"139","—Not any one.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",139
"140","15953. Who is responsible for the place being so very dirty down about here?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",140
"141","—I suppose it is the sanitary inspector.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",141
"142","15954. When this pier is erected will there not be some authority to look after it?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",142
"143","—There is a sanitary inspector paid to do it, and he ought to look after it.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",143
"144","15955. The Chairman.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",144
"145","—Who is the sanitary inspector?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",145
"146","—The sanitary inspector for the parish of Barvas. He lives in Stornoway.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",146
"147","15956. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",147
"148","—Don't you think the state of matters there is disgraceful?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",148
"149","—I am very much disgusted with it, but I cannot help it, I would like to see it clean.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",149
"150","15957. There is no reason why it should not be clean?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",150
"151","—No reason. They could keep it as clean as any town in Scotland, for there is a burn there, and they could clean everything down to it. We are fifty feet",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",151
"152","higher than the level of the sea, and there is always running water.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",152
"153","15958. Sheriff Nicolson",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",153
"154","—Has any complaint been made to the inspector ?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",154
"155","—I don't suppose there has; I do not know.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",155
"156","15959. The Chairman.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",156
"157","—What is his name?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",157
"158","—Hector Ross; he is the parochial inspector too.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",158
"159","15960. Does he often come here?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",159
"160","—Yes ; I have seen him often come over here.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",160
"161","15961. Does he ever give any order about cleaning?",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",161
"162","—I never heard it.",289,"John Macleod","Lewis, Ness",162
