"25","Statement by Lachlan M'Kinnon, residing there. ",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",25
"26","Gentlemen, I desire to state that over twenty years ago I purchased, for the sum of £40, a croft at that time belonging to one Archibald M'Phail. M'Phail was then in arrears of rent to the extent of about £12. This sum was deducted by the factor from the principal, and the balance handed to M'Phail, who subsequently went to America. The late Mr John Campbell was then chamberlain to his Grace the Duke of Argyll, and Mr Lachlan M'Quarie, ground officer here. After occupying my croft for over twelve years it was taken from me, and no reason given for doing so. When I asked the chamberlain if he had anything against me, he said that he had not, but that there were other reasons. I was then paying for my croft a yearly rent of £5, 10s., and was not in arrears. My family was then young. My stock consisted of one horse and two cows. These I was obliged to sell. With the proceeds, and some money which I borrowed from a friend, I purchased an east coast fishing boat, which I have since had enlarged; and from the time I was deprived of my croft until now the boat has",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",26
"27","been the principal means of support of myself and family. I have a wife, six sons, and three daughters. At the time my croft was taken from me, I was allowed to retain one acre of it, or thereabout; the remainder being given to another crofter. During Mr Campbell's time I was not charged any rent for the acre retained, but during the factorship of his successor, Mr Geikie, I was obliged to sign a paper agreeing to pay rent if required, at any future time. I was never charged rent by Mr Geikie, but I am now paying the sum of 30s. for the said acre yearly. When my croft was taken from me I was promised another croft in return, but which, notwithstanding my frequent applications to the then and subsequent factors, I am still without. On the ground I now occupy I can only plant a few barrels of potatoes, and am obliged to plant more potatoes in other crofters' ground, paying rent therefor. My present stock consists of two cows and one horse, the grazing and wintering of these respectively costing me over £20 a year. I have never received compensation of any kind for the loss of my croft, although at the time it was taken from me I was willing to emigrate with my family, had money compensation been given me. As I consider that I have been most unjustly deprived of my land, and there being no apparent intention on the part of his Grace the Duke of Argyll to reinstate me therein, or in another croft, I beg humbly to present this statement for the consideration of your honours.'",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",27
"28","34190. Did you ever see again this document you signed saying you would be obedient to the factor?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",28
"29","—-No, but I have heard people who have seen it and who signed it,",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",29
"30","34191. You have not seen it?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",30
"31","—No, not I.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",31
"32","34192. Was it ever produced again?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",32
"33","—Not to my knowledge, but the people who signed it told me they did so.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",33
"34","34193. Did they get a copy of it ?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",34
"35","—It seems not.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",35
"36","34194. What is your rent at the present time?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",36
"37","—£21, 10s. 6d., I think.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",37
"38","34195. Was your father in the croft before you?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",38
"39","—We were in Balphuil first.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",39

"42","34197. Was it your brother or your father that came there first?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",42
"43","—My father.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",43
"44","34198. What was the rent?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",44
"45","—About £18.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",45
"46","34199. How much money was put on for drainage?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",46
"47","—None upon us.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",47
"48","34200. Therefore, the rise from £18 to £21, 10s. is a rise that was put on for reasons unknown to you ?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",48
"49","—I may state the reasons perhaps. The rents were raised twice forbye the drainage money, and it was sent by the factor amongst the tenants to divide amongst themselves, and they valued the crofts amongst themselves, and if you did not take so much of this rent which is given in lately you will give me your croft, and the crofters had to remove back and forward amongst themselves.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",49
"50","34201. Did they value the whole township?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",50
"51","—Yes, among themselves, and we had to give up one of the crofts we had for one of these light sandy ones, and latterly we were removed down there altogether.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",51
"52","34202. You present a paper from Lachlan M'Kinnon, in which he says he bought his croft and paid £40 on entering it; was that a common custom? ",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",52
"53","—Yes, it was in old times that such as Lachlan M'Kinnon bought the rental; that is when he bought the stock it was understood that he bought the use of the rental along with it.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",53
"54","34203. When he paid £40 he got some stock for it ?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",54
"55","—He would have some stock, but it was understood he would have the benefit of the croft by buying the rental.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",55
"56","34204. The goodwill?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",56
"57","—Yes, his Grace allowed them to sell the rental. John Maclean bought his place, that was what he did. It was understood he had it while he paid his rent.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",57
"58","34205. And did everybody have the right of selling it in old times ?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",58
"59","—It seems they had before factor Campbell's days.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",59
"60","34206. He stopped that?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",60
"61","—Yes, my father bought his first croft the same way in Balphuil. ",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",61
"62","34207. How long is it since this practice was stopped ?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",62

"66","34209. Where do you get it ?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",66
"67","—From Ardrossan.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",67
"68","34210. What do you pay for it ?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",68
"69","—The price varies, sometimes 14s., 10s., and 17s. 6d., and it has been as high as 30s. per ton.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",69
"70","34211. Will it come to £ 4 on an average ?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",70

"84","—Yes.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",84
"85","34218. Do your sons and daughters frequently send home money from their wages ?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",85
"86","—Generally they do.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",86
"87","34219. Would it be possible to pay the rent throughout the country unless the younger members of a family sent money from their wages ?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",87
"88","—As far as I know, I don't think it would; in most cases it would not.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",88

"94","—All we know is this —the paper was not read to us at all, but the ground officer had a lot of notices to quit in one hand and this paper in another, and we were told that the contents of the paper were that we would require to obey anything that the Duke of Argyll or his factor would ask us to do.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",94
"95","34223. Was it written or printed ?",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",95
"96","—It was written.",569,"Neil Mcneil","Argyll, Tyree",96
