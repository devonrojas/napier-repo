"5","35260. Have you a personal grievance which you wish to state ?",583,"Duncan Campbell","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",5
"6","—Yes. In Martinmas 1846 my father and my grandfather and I were in Knocknafeannaig. I made, improvements in that place by the directions of his Grace of Argyll in 1843. I went on with the improvements until 1846, and in that year Mr Campbell, the factor, came. I built the house at my own expense. In 1854 a tenant came in, and six of the crofters were dispossessed of their holdings, and their places given to the one man. The six were dispossessed of their crofts for the sake of this one man who took their place. One of them is here, Donald Macdonald.",583,"Duncan Campbell","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",6
"7","35261. Has this got anything to do with your own case?",583,"Duncan Campbell","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",7
