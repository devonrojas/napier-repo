"9","13162. Have you any complaint to make about the sea-weed ?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",9
"10","—No, we have plenty of sea-ware. The wind drives it towards us.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",10
"11","13163. Have you liberty to gather it on the shore of the tack as well as on your own ?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",11
"12","—That gentleman never prevented us.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",12
"13","13164. He never charged any money for it?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",13
"14","—He never charged us any money for it.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",14
"15","13165. Where do you get your peats from now?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",15
"16","—The island of Tay.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",16
"17","13166. Have you liberty to take it there without paying, or do you pay ?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",17
"18","—That island is our own ; we pay rent for it.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",18
"19","13167. Is anybody living on it?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",19
"20","—No.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",20
"21","13168. Is there plenty of peat?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",21
"22","—Yes, but it is falling off.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",22
"23","13169. How far from Bernera is it?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",23
"24","—It takes about three-quarters of an hour rowing on a good day with a favourable wind.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",24
"25","13170. Is there any peat on the tack?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",25
"26","—There is no peat at all on the island of Bernera.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",26
"27","13171. Do the tacksman's people get their peat from Tay?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",27
"28","—No, they get it from another island that Mr Macdonald has called Vacasay.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",28
"29","13172. Is that nearer than Tay ?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",29
"30","—No, Vacasay is a little outside Tay ; but another island where Mr Macdonald's grieve and some of his people live and get their peats is nearer than Bernera—the island of Stroma.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",30
"31","13173. Do you think, if you could get back the farm of Borv, it would make you all comfortable ?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",31
"32","—There is no doubt we would be. It is the scarcity of the land which leaves us in the condition we are.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",32
"33","13174. Have you anything more to say?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",33
"34","—I have to say of my own croft that the rent is £5. My family consists of my Avife and myself, and all we can raise on my croft will not support us for three months.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",34
"35","13175. What stock do you keep?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",35
"36","—Two cows and a mare.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",36
"37","13176. Any sheep?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",37
"38","—About six ewes, but it is on other people's land; I buy grass for them. I buy the seed which I put into my ground.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",38
"39","13177. Where do you get the thatch for your houses ?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",39
"40","—We formerly used to thatch our houses with straw, when we had more of it, but since then we chiefly thatch them with bent, which we mostly get from Mr",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",40
"41","Macdonald.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",41
"42","13178. Does Mr Macdonald make you pay for it with labour or otherwise, or does he give it to you for nothing ?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",42
"43","—That gentleman would take nothing from any poor man whom he could help.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",43
"44","13179. If you had more nets could you do more with the fishing?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",44
"45","—Those who are fit for it undoubtedly would. It is past my time.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",45
"46","13180. Had you more nets in olden times 1—We never did much with the herring fishery, and had not many nets for that purpose till within the last few years, when a few of them got nets.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",46
"47","13181. Mr Fraser-Macintosh",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",47
"48","—Are the people in arrears of rent, or are they able to pay their rent ?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",48
"49","—I have not for five years sold a beast off my own lands till last year, when I sold a stirk to pay the rent. ",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",49
"50","13182. Is the landlord easy upon you in the matter of arrears?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",50
"51","—We can say nothing against the landlord. Many things can be done under a laird without his knowledge.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",51
"52","13183. You complain of paying for a doctor. Where does the doctor live ?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",52
"53","—He lives here at Obe.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",53
"54","13184. Does he sometimes go to Bernera?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",54
"55","—Very seldom.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",55
"56","13185. Is he of use to you?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",56
"57","—He must be doing some good, for we sometimes send for him or go to him.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",57
"58","13186. And you say you still pay for the old packet. What is this payment?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",58
"59","—There was formerly a packet which used to run between this and Uist, and also a packet that ran to Skye. There is no packet now.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",59
"60","13187. Do you say you have still to pay the packet money ",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",60
"61","—I cannot say positively, except that I heard some say it was so.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",61
"62","13188. Would you rather be without a doctor or pay this money ",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",62
"63","—Anyone of us might break his arm or leg, and then we would need a doctor.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",63
"64","13189. The Chairman.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",64
"65","—Do you make this payment about the packet distinctly, or is it paid along with your rent ?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",65
"66","—I pay £5.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",66
"67","13190. What taxes are laid upon you besides that?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",67
"68","—I am not very sure. There is 5s. of road money and 5s. for the doctor. I think they all pay that. There is so much in the pound for poor and school rates.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",68
"69","13191. Sheriff Nicolson.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",69
"70","—Do you need a road in the island?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",70
"71","—Yes, we are in need of a road from south to north.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",71
"72","13192. Have you any wheeled carts?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",72
"73","—There is one cart in the island.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",73
"74","13193. Would carts be useful to you?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",74
"75","—I don't know. On the west side of the island where I live it would be very difficult to make roads for us, it is so subject to the drifting of the sand.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",75
"76","13194. How do you bring your sea-ware up to the arable land?",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",76
"77","—On horses. In the time of my father there was an assessment of 2s. 6d. for the minister, 2s. .6d. for the packet, and 2s. 6d. for the doctor, and when Sir Edward Scott bought the north end of Harris there was a doctor appointed for that part of the island, and 2s. 6d. was added to the former assessment on our island for two doctors—one for each end of the island. We would like to know the details of the taxes which we are called upon to pay, which are not specified in the receipts that are given to us.",233,"Lachlan Munro","Harris, Obe",77
