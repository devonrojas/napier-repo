"1","CHARLES M'KENZIE, Crofter, Torrin (71)—examined. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",1
"2","4386. The Chairman.",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",2
"3","—Are you a fisherman as well as a crofter?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",3
"4","—I am not a fisherman at all. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",4
"5","4387. Were you freely elected a delegate by the people of Torrin ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",5
"6","— Yes, I was constrained even to go. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",6
"7","4388. By how many people ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",7
"8","—The whole people of the township. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",8
"9","4389. Without any influence ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",9
"10","—Without any. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",10
"11","4390. What statement have you got to make on the part of the people of Torrin?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",11
"12","—They are for having their holdings increased—those who can take such increased holdings. Another thing of which they complain, is that the land which they have is refusing to yield crop. Though we sow seed we do not reap, and besides that, the deer are eating our corn. Years before, the deer would not come upon us until the corn was filling; but now they come to eat the braird, and the tops of the potatoes. Yesterday, for the first time, my neighbour had a piece of clover sown, and when he rose in the morning the deer were browsing on it. We have need to be protected from the deer, but we are promised such protection. We never got any compensation for loss caused to us by the deer. We had to stand it ourselves, and besides that, even though our land was refusing to yield its crop, Tormore, the factor, raised our rents and the mill in which we had been grinding our corn for the past forty years is now idle, and has been so for twenty years back. Besides that, the one year's seed will not sow our crofts the next year. We have to buy seed oats in Greenock. If I did not get credit from a merciful man who is there, my lot, for the most part of it, would be uncultivated. I have nothing further to say, but that the land will not pay itself. Our arable land will not yield as much as will feed the stock we have. We have to feed them with oatmeal and with Indian meal at the end of the year, and that expense is eating up the value of the beasts; and we must needs pay Lord Macdonald's rent to the uttermost penny at the end of the year, at any rate. Now, what is to happen to us if our earnings fail us ? How can we afford to pay the meal merchant ? When I was a young man, I was at work earning wages, and I was not troubling any man; but now I am become old, I cannot follow the occupation in which I was making a living before. My savings in these times have supported me hitherto, but are now exhausted. I have nothing now but the little stock which is on my ground, and when that will be exhausted I do not know what to do unless I get some enlargement of my holding while the stock is left to me, to keep me up during the few years I have yet to live, and that will not be very many. I have not been such a long time in the place in which I now am, but as to the other things that happened, there is one here who is older than me, and he knows better than me, and can tell better about these things—the things that have happened. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",12
"13","4391. The Chairman.",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",13
"14","—Who is that?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",14
"15","—Neil Nicolson. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",15
"16","4392. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",16
"17","—How near is the deer forest to you?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",17
"18","— It marches with our hill pasture. The deer come and trespass over our hill pasture. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",18
"19","4393. How large is your hill pasture ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",19
"20","—About three miles. There are two miles at any rate in our march with the deer forest. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",20
"21","4394. Was any of your hill land taken away for the forest ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",21
"22","—We were never deprived of hill pasture. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",22
"23","4395. Do I understand you correctly to have said that it was agreed to fence your lands from the deer ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",23
"24","—Yes, the factor promised that, with our own assistance, he would protect us from the deer. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",24
"25","4396. When do you expect that fencing to be put up?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",25
"26","—We were promised that it would be up by the end of summer. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",26
"27","4397. What sort of fencing?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",27
"28","—A wire fence on the top of our own dykes. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",28
"29","4398. Mr Cameron.",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",29
"30","—How many miles of fence would be requhvd to keep the deer out ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",30
"31","—I don't know exactly. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",31
"32","4399. Has the factor taken no steps towards getting the fence up?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",32
"33","— Yes. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",33
"34","4400. What steps has he taken ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",34
"35","—He has provided stobs for us, and he is to provide wire. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",35
"36","4401. Are the stobs cut?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",36
"37","—Yes. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",37
"38","4402. Where are they ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",38
"39","—I believe near Broadford here. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",39
"40","4403. So, in point of fact, the fence is all ready to put up ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",40
"41","—We have to drive them home ourselves, and sink the stobs in the ground. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",41
"42","4404. When are you going to drive them home?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",42
"43","—Of course, I cannot say. Those who have horses can tell better, for I have no conveyance of the kind. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",43
"44","4405. But, in point of fact, the fence is all ready to be put up ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",44
"45","—Well the stobs are all right, I believe, but I really don't know whether the wires have come forward or not. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",45
"46","4406. But the stobs would not be got unless there was an intention of putting up the fence ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",46
"47","—They would be got for no other intention. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",47
"48","4407. And you believe it will be put up?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",48
"49","—I believe, in the main, that he will stand to his promise. I have no occasion to doubt it. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",49
"50","4408. Do you say no one had been paid for any damage done to crops ? ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",50
"51","—No damages whatever; but, I may state, a widow woman in the neighbourhood has got £2, 2s. of late for all she sustained. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",51
"52","4409. What size is her croft?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",52
"53","—She has a half croft. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",53
"54","4410. How many acres ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",54
"55","—I believe there are seven or eight acres; but I am not very sure. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",55
"56","4411. When was she paid this £2, 2s.?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",56
"57","—I have overheard it of late. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",57
"58","4412. You believe it to be true ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",58
"59","—I believe it to be true, from the source it came. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",59
"60","4413. The Chairman.",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",60
"61","—Whose deer are they?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",61
"62","—Lord Macdonald's. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",62
"63","4414. They belong to Lord Macdonald's deer forest?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",63
"64","—Yes. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",64
"65","4415. How long have they been there?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",65
"66","—Longer than I myself, but they are getting more numerous. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",66
"67","4416. Have they been doing damage to the crops for many years past? ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",67
"68","—Yes, for as long as I have been in the neighbourhood. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",68
"69","4417. Were complaints made about it in former times?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",69
"70","—Yes, complaints were made, but no recompense was given. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",70
"71","4418. Have complaints been very often made ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",71
"72","—Yes, but Mr Mackinnon of Corrie, the factor, was giving us about £2 a year to help us to pay a watchman over them at night. That is done away with. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",72
"73","4419. How long is it since it was done away with?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",73
"74","—I don't recollect, for I was not all the time in the country. I had to go to employment to make my living. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",74
"75","4420. How long is it since the fence was promised ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",75
"76","—It was promised last summer and last harvest time. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",76
"77","4421. What is the nature of the fence which is going to be put up?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",77
"78","— Stobs with wire on the top of our own dyke. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",78
"79","4422. How many wires?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",79
"80","—Three wires, I believe, was the intention, so that he believed the deer would not jump over. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",80
"81","4423. How high will it be altogether ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",81
"82","—Eight feet nine inches",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",82
"83","—seven feet or eight feet anyway. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",83
"84","4424. Will this fence go round all the common pasture? No, only four lots of the arable land on the top next the hill. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",84
"85","4425. It will go round the arable land next the hill ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",85
"86","—Yes. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",86
"87","4426. Will it not go round the common pasture?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",87
"88","—No. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",88
"89","4427. Do the deer come on the common pasture?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",89
"90","—Yes, on Saturday I saw them feeding on my neighbour's clover. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",90
"91","4428. Is the clover on the pasture or the arable land ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",91
"92","—It is on the croft he is labouring for his crops. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",92
"93","4429. He has arable land?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",93
"94","—Yes. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",94
"95","4430. Do the deer do any harm to the common pasture? Do they disturb the sheep or do any harm to the common pasture ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",95
"96","—We don't look to that; but one thing is, we are prevented from being seen upon the hill the time of the shooting, by the huntsmen—the lease-holders of the deer. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",96
"97","4431. They don't like you to go upon your own common pasture ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",97
"98","—No, if they go round the time of the hunting. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",98
"99","4432. Suppose there were a fence put all round the common pasture as well as the arable ground, would that be advantageous to you ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",99
"100","—I believe it would, but if it were round the arable ground we would require no more. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",100
"101","4433. When the deer come upon the arable land and eat up the crop, what do you do?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",101
"102","—Watch them at night the time of the crop filling. That is the time they used to come on of late years, even last year, and thus they are eating the braird of the corn as it comes up. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",102
"103","4434. Did anybody ever kill a deer that came on the arable ground ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",103
"104","— We dare not.",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",104
"105","4435. What would happen to you if you killed a deer?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",105
"106","—I would be evicted out of the place, for the first thing. They could not hang me, I believe. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",106
"107","4436. Is it against the law to kill the deer upon your ground?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",107
"108","—I believe it is against the law of the landlord, whether it is against the law of the land I cannot tell",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",108
"109","4437. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",109
"110","—What rent do you pay ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",110
"111","—I pay £3, 5s. for a quarter of the lot at this time. It did not used to be so high till Tormore raised it, and then, when the rent was raised the other assessments were rising along with it, and that makes the burden heavy. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",111
"112","4438. What stock do you keep ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",112
"113","—Just one cow and a half, I may say. A cow and a two-year-old are allowed me. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",113
"114","4439. And a horse ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",114
"115","—I am not allowed to keep a horse. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",115
"116","4440. And sheep ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",116
"117","—'Well, there are sheep, I believe. About fifty on the lot, and the quarter of fifty will be about twelve. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",117
"118","4441. How many have you got yourself?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",118
"119","—That is what is allowed me. It is a club stock. I have to stand the consequences of the loss besides. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",119
"120","4442. Does the club shepherd not go upon the hill at the shooting time ?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",120
"121","—Yes, but he must do it early in the morning, and have not a foot on their grounds after they come out. ",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",121
"122","4443. But are they not so hard upon you the rest of the year?",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",122
"123","—No, the rest of the year they are not so hard upon us'. They were that hard upon us. We need ropes to keep the thatch on our houses, and we spin that rope out of heather. There was a neighbour of mine on the hill for this purpose, and a huntsman came up to him and threatened to shoot him if he would be seen there again, even on their own heather that they were paying rent for,—for fear of molesting the muirfowl. We had to stand all this. We were afraid we would be prosecuted if we should speak out, because it was a great boon to the landlord, of course. We have stood many a thing, but we were feared to speak out, and whatever may be done we must stand it, or else prepare ourselves for the worst.",78,"Charles Mckenzie","Skye, Broadford",123
