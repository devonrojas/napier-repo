"1","JOHN NICOLSON, Crofter and Fisherman, Doirre-na-Guille, Rona (36)—examined.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",1
"2","8052. The Chairman.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",2
"3","—Were you freely elected a delegate ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",3
"4","—Yes.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",4
"5","8053. Have you got a statement to make on the part of the people who elected you ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",5
"6","—I have not much to say but the truth. I make it out that should I be here from sunrise to sunset I could not fully disclose the poverty of Rona. It is a place in which no man need expect to make his living. We are working on sea and land, both summer, and winter, and spring—every quarter of the year—and after that we have only poverty. I cannot say but that Mr Wood is a kind man ever since we saw him—kind to the poor, and helpful to the widows; but we will ever be poor as long as we are kept crowded in a place of which we cannot make use. I can say with truth that my skiff is my cart, and that the wives and the children are the horses, and there is truth in that, because it is the work of the horses which they perform. The creel is on their back continually, and after being worked so hard as that, they cannot make a living out of it. I myself remember the township in which I am being in possession of one man. Then four had it. Now eight have it—I mean eight families—and I make out there are fifty souls in the township. That one man was paying £17, 19s. of rent, and now the rent is £25 ; but it is Mr Mackay who raised the rent, Mr Wood has left it as he found it. All the new houses which have been built have been built by Mr Wood.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",6
"7","8054. Who built the houses in Mr Mackay's time?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",7
"8","—There were no new houses built until Mr Wood became the proprietor.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",8
"9","8055. Where did the eight families come from?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",9
"10","—Two came from Kyle-Rona, and the rest was their own increase. They were getting no other place in which to live. I don't think any one could make a living in Rona as long as they live crowded upon each other as at present.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",10
"11","8056. Sheriff Nicolson.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",11
"12","—Did you build your own house?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",12
"13","—I never built a new house. I would get the house built for me ; but I was not seeing it worth my while building a house for the plot of land I had. ",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",13
"14","8057. Where was your father staying?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",14
"15","—In the same township.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",15
"16","8058. Was it ho who built the house?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",16
"17","—It was Mr Wood who gave him the timber.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",17
"18","8059. Is there wood enough growing in Raasay to supply roofs to the houses ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",18
"19","—Yes.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",19
"20","8060. They supply some, I believe, to people on the mainland of Skye?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",20
"21","—Yes, he is very good for giving timber to people.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",21
"22","8061. Is your house a slated one!",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",22
"23","—No, it is the old block house I have.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",23
"24","8062. But the one Mr Wood built?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",24
"25","—There are no slated houses in our township.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",25
"26","8063. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",26
"27","—Do you concur with the preceding witness as to the necessity for several of them being removed to the mainland?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",27
"28","—I believe that they will never be well off till that is done.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",28
"29","8064. Are you yourself willing to go?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",29
"30","—Yes, I have been long willing. That is the reason why I don't want to build a house.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",30
"31","8065. Have the Rona people asked Mr Wood to do something for them in that direction?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",31
"32","—I cannot say that they did.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",32
"33","8066. Why did not they do so, if he is a kind landlord, and a good man?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",33
"34","—I am told there are some who asked to get land, and they told me so, but they did not get the land yet, and I did not hear what the reply was. I was speaking once or twice about a place to the manager, and the reason for not granting the request was that there was no vacant place for me.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",34
"35","8067. If you got the offer yourself to be carried to some good place in America or Australia, with your family, would you go?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",35
"36","—There are more of my friends in America and Australia than there are in Raasay, and I have not seen or heard that my father or mother got a paper or a letter asking them to go out there, and I am not aware that a £ 1 note or a Is. ever came to them to help them, to show that that land was better than",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",36
"37","the place they had left.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",37
"38","8068. Sheriff Nicolson",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",38
"39","—But don't you think that people who go to these far away places are apt to neglect their friends, not because they are not successful, but just because they become forgetful of friends? I believe there are plenty letters coming from others, but I never heard of them asking people to go out there.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",39
"40","8069. And therefore, you don't feel encouraged to go to any of these places?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",40
"41","—No, I would like to have a place in the land of my birth.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",41
"42","8070. But is it not a fact that there are men who went from Skye without a penny, who are now members of parliament and rich men in Canada and Australia?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",42
"43","—I cannot know about that, but I have no mind to go abroad.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",43
"44","8071. You would rather stay in Rona, bad as it is, than try your chance in these places?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",44
"45","—It is likely. I am there for some time past at any rate, and I am trying sea and land, and every one in the place is in the same way. We have gone to the east coast fishing with our bags to sell ourselves there to the highest bidder, and after all I have known many coming home, and the masters could not, after the fishing was over, give them one shilling of their own earnings to bring them home. The fishing is only a lottery. One year it may be successful, and another time the contrary; and that happened to me often.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",45
"46","8072. If you had one or two good big boats like those on the east coast given to you at Rona, could you work them ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",46
"47","—We would know how to work them, but we have another thing against that. I think, when a man",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",47
"48","is dealing with a croft, it is enough for him to attend to the croft itself, and the one thing is only spoiling the other.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",48
"49","8073. If you could get a good big boat, would it not be better to be a fisherman altogether, with just a little bit of ground for potatoes ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",49
"50","—-If I was to be a fisherman I would be a fisherman; if I was to be a crofter I would be a crofter; and I think, if that would not be the case, it would simply be spoiling both.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",50
"51","8074. Then, would it not be better to be entirely fishermen, and not dependent upon that miserable rocky ground, which is wearying yourselves and your wives and children ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",51
"52","—I have said already the fishing is only a lottery, and we are not in a good fishing place at all unless we are to go to other places.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",52
"53","8075. Then why should not you go to fish all round Scotland, as the east coast fishermen do ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",53
"54","—I can only give my own opinion, but I myself have been going to sea ever since I could. I tried the fishing, and it defied me. I am thinking now that if a man could get in a good place a bit of ground, and if he should happen to get stock upon it at one time, and to get the land at a reasonable rent, it would be better for him than any fishing I have ever seen.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",54
"55","8076. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",55
"56","—You said you remembered a time when there was only one family in the township, and when the township was rented at £17, 19s. ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",56
"57","—Yes.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",57
"58","8077. When did these other families come in?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",58
"59","—I cannot tell.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",59
"60","8078. Who gave it to the four ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",60
"61","—Mr Rainnie.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",61
"62","8079. And who gave it to the eight ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",62
"63","—Some were in Mackay's time, and others have had their names entered for lots in the township in Mr Wood's time.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",63
"64","8080. Those were sub-tenants—cottars in the township ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",64
"65","—Yes, cottars.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",65
"66","8081. When was the rent raised from £17,19s. to £25?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",66
"67","—In Mackay's time.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",67
"68","8082. The whole of it?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",68
"69","—Yes.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",69
"70","8083. Are you paying anything for the new houses that have been built for you ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",70
"71","—No.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",71
"72","8084. Did Mr Wood pay for the building of the houses as well as give the wood ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",72
"73","—He paid for all but one of the houses, so far as I understand.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",73
"74","8085. And you were not asked for any increase of rent in consequence ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",74
"75","—No, the rent is as Mr Mackay left it. Mr Wood has made no change.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",75
"76","8086. The Chairman.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",76
"77","—Has Mr Wood made any other improvements in the way of draining and fencing ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",77
"78","—Nothing beyond the houses.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",78
"79","8087. Would draining do any good ?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",79
"80","—Is there no land in Rona that would be improved by draining 1",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",80
"81","—No, not much. There are some places you could drain, but before the water could be got to run, the rocks would need to be blasted. It is bad ground —peaty soil.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",81
"82","8088. So you don't think any expenditure of money could do any material good in Rona?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",82
"83","—I cannot understand what expense would accomplish.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",83
"84","8089. Did the people assist in collecting the stones, or carrying materials to build the new houses, or was all the work done by Mr Wood?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",84
"85","—They were quarrying the stones, and they were getting so much for their labour in doing this, and Mr Wood was giving timber for internal fittings.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",85
"86","8090. Are these houses as little better than the old fashioned block houses?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",86
"87","—Yes.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",87
"88","8091. What are they covered with?",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",88
"89","—Thatch. Some years, I may say with truth, that what I get from the oats will not sow the ground next year.",152,"John Nicolson","Raasay, Torran",89
