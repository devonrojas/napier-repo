"1","NORMAN M'LEAN, Free Church Catechist, Barra (48)—examined.",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",1
"2","10983. The Chairman.",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",2
"3","We shall be very happy to receive any written statement from you in regard to the people ?",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",3
"4","—I have no written statement; I did not expect to speak here at all.",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",4
"5","10984. Well, if you have anything to state to the Commission we shall be glad to hear it. Your communion is not a very large one ?",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",5
"6","—No. All I have to say I can say in a few minutes. I find them very much improved from the time I came among them fourteen years ago. I find that the people whom I call my own especially are very much better off now than they were when I came among them. The most of them have far better houses. Some of them when I came among them had very miserable houses indeed—houses which I would not consider a good stable for my pony. But now it is very different. Some of them have got houses in which the proprietor might put up for a night. Their stock is better, their clothing better, and their feeding better. I have never yet heard any of our people coming to me and complaining of any grievances they had in regard to land or anything of that kind. With regard to other people of a different denomination, I have experienced very great kindness among them since I got acquainted with them. I once had as many as sixty or seventy of their children in my school, and some of these are now getting on very well, and some have sent most favourable accounts from New Zealand. They were at one of the Edinburgh ladies' schools. I still continue to experience very great kindness among the people. They live kindly and peaceably among each other, and there were no strivings or rows uutil very lately. As to the cause of that I don't like to say much.",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",6
"7","10985. What do you think is the cause of these divisions or the bad feeling that exists ?",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",7
"8","—Well, I may not fix on the right thing, and I am far safer not to say anything at all.",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",8
"9","10986. You teach the Shorter Catechism ",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",9
"10","—Ycs.",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",10
"11","10987. Would you receive Roman Catholic children, and dispense with religions instruction in their easel",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",11
"12","—Not now. Since the public schools were opened I have not got any of them to my own school at all.",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",12
"13","10988. Did you use to get them ?",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",13
"14","—Yes. They all read the Bible and learned the Shorter Catechism when at my school.",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",14
"15","10989. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",15
"16","And they were not the worse of the latter ",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",16
"17","—I don't think it.",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",17
"18","10990. Professor Mackinnon.",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",18
"19","Would you have received them without insisting on the Bible and Catechism formerly ",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",19
"20","—Yes. I never insisted on it unless they were willing themselves.",188,"Norman Mclean","Barra, Castlebay",20
