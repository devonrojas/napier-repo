"13","1264. How much was the rent when you were a boy?",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",13

"17","1266. What are the complaints which are made by the people whom you represent at Drumuie ?",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",17
"18","—Their one particular complaint is that they are in a confined township, without sea or hill pasture, and we had hill pasture before now.",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",18
"19","1267. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",19
"20","—How many crofts are there in Drumuie",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",20
"21","—Six crofts, and six families occupy the six crofts.",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",21
"22","1268. The Chairman.",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",22
"23","—No cottars?",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",23
"24","—Not many.",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",24
"25","1269. About how many?",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",25
"26","—Two cottars, but they don't pay anything to us at any rate. We particularly want hill pasture; we cannot live without it.",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",26
"27","1270. When was the hill pasture taken away ?",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",27

"31","1272. How long is that ago?",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",31
"32","—A long time since; I believe fifty years ago. A little reduction was made at that time in our rent. We made some work on our lots ; we got some rent remitted to us on account of that. We are paying the interest of that money till now, though it should have been paid out in sixteen years. But the pasture connected with our township is so bad that it is not worth walking over. Our families cannot exist in our townships for want of sheep stock—buying everything that the family needs, and having no sheep, and the only thing we want is the hill pasture.",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",32
"33","1273. If you had a hill pasture would you find stock to put on it?",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",33
"34","— Yes.",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",34
"35","1274. Could you pay rent for the hill pasture?",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",35

"37","1275. Have you ever asked the factor or the proprietor to give you hill pasture ?",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",37
"38","—We did not ask our present factor. We never asked hill pasture—I did not at any rate; but we intended.",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",38
"39","1276. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",39
"40","—Do you complain at all of the rent?",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",40
"41","— We do not complain anything particularly of that, if we would only get the hill pasture. We want the late increase in our rents to be taken off; about 3s. in the £ .",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",41
"42","1277. Are the crofts worse than they were, or are you able to get crops still on your land ?",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",42
"43","—Our crops are much worse than they used to be. It is not much use over and above feeding our stock. It will not altogether feed our stock. We have to provender for them otherwise.",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",43
"44","1278. What provender do you buy generally?",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",44
"45","—£3 to £4 worth of corn.",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",45
"46","1279. Straw or hay?",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",46
"47","—Just as happens to be most obtainable.",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",47
"48","1280. The Chairman.",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",48
"49","—Have you anything more you wish to state before you retire ?",20,"Ewan Morrison","Skye, Skeabost",49
