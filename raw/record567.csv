"1","LACHLAN M'PHAIL, Farmer, Kilmoluag (50)—examined.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",1
"2","34100. The Chairman.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",2
"3","—How long have you been tenant in your present farm ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",3
"4","—Twenty years. ",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",4
"5","34101. During that period has it always been the same size?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",5
"6","—Yes, an adjacent croft was added to it since that time.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",6
"7","34102. How large is it now?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",7
"8","—I cannot very well tell you the exact extent of arable ground. There was a good deal of arable ground once,",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",8
"9","but the sand drifted and I gave up cultivating it, and I have it mostly under pasture now.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",9
"10","34103. Have you got hill pasture?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",10
"11","—All the grazing is enclosed—the whole land is enclosed, grazing and all. There was a strip that used to be",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",11
"12","common pasture to the remaining crofters in the township, but it was a cause of difference between us, and it was valued and added to the rest and fenced in.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",12
"13","34104. Was your father or any member of your family a tenant there before ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",13
"14","—No. myself and my brother had it at the beginning.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",14
"15","34105. Was the croft which was added to the farm of great use to the farm?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",15
"16","—No, it was not of much use to the farm or to me, and I did not ask it. But the marches suited to put them together.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",16
"17","34106. What became of the previous tenant of the croft?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",17
"18","—The tenant of it is still upon the croft. He had to give it up, for he had no stock and fell back. He gave it up of his own accord.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",18
"19","34107. Have you got a lease?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",19
"20","—No.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",20
"21","34108. What is your rent?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",21
"22","—£49, 3s. 6d.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",22
"23","34109. Has the rent been the same during the whole period of your occupancy ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",23
"24","—Yes, the same.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",24
"25","34110. Do you find farming more profitable at present prices than when you began ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",25
"26","—No, not so far as the arable cultivation is concerned, because we are subject to the drifting of sand on the place; but the grazing stock is more profitable now.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",26
"27","34111. A tenant was asked by Sir Kenneth Mackenzie what he thought the proper rent for a cow was, and he answered from 25s. to 30s. I want to know whether the cottars or the poor ever ask the farmers here for",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",27
"28","the grazing of a cow for the summer or during the whole year?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",28
"29","—It is quite a common practice.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",29
"30","34112. How much do the cottars, where they graze a cow on a farm, pay for the grazing?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",30
"31","—The practice is to give the grazing for the six months of summer and autumn. It is not the practice to charge for winter grazing. And the price depends exactly on the condition of the outrun for the time being, whether the tenants keep a greater or less amount of stock upon it. Sometimes it is down to 7s., as this year, and sometimes it is as high as 16s. There is not, so far as I am aware, a single crofter in Tyree who would give pasture for a cow within what we call the ring fence, within the arable portion ; he might allow it to graze upon the outrun, but not to pasture within the croft.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",31
"32","34113. Then the price upon the outrun would run up to 17s. for six months?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",32
"33","—Seven shillings to 16s. for as much as a cow would pick up. It has sometimes been down to 5s.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",33
"34","34114. How does a cottar sustain his cow during the other six months of the year ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",34
"35","—On the goodwill of his neighbours.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",35
"36","34115. Does he pay for the goodwill?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",36
"37","—I am not aware. The cow is allowed to feed as it may; as much as it can gather outside without any charge, but any hand feeding is paid for.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",37
"38","34116. Do you know how much a cottar would usually pay for winter fodder ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",38
"39","—It is very difficult to say what the outlay of a cottar is; a cow would require, to be well fed, £4  but no cottar lays out that amount.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",39
"40","34117. Do you think he would lay out £ 3 for winter food?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",40
"41","—I really cannot tell; there is many a one I know who feeds a cow has not £ 3 to spare ; how he does it I don't know.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",41
"42","34118. Would it be any advantage to you to have a lease; or are you quite satisfied as you are?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",42
"43","—No, I am not dissatisfied. I have no fear that I will be dispossessed as long as I pay my rent.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",43
"44","34119. Were your houses and offices built by the proprietor or by yourself, or by both together ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",44
"45","—The houses were built before I went there; but I believe they were built by the tenant, and that the proprietor had nothing to do with them.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",45
"46","34120. Did you pay the previous tenant anything for them?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",46
"47","—Nothing. ",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",47
"48","34121. Then if you went away you would not expect to get any compensation?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",48
"49","—I really cannot say what may happen in the future, but that has been the practice of the place.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",49
"50","34122. There are no regulations on the estate for compensation for buildings ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",50
"51","—I am not aware that there has been for small holdings like ours.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",51
"52","34123. Professor Mackinnon.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",52
"53","—Had your father a holding?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",53
"54","—Yes.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",54
"55","34124. What was his rent?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",55
"56","—£5. He lived in a different township.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",56
"57","34125. Do you remember any of your neighbours in this island at the time of the potato disease that had a large croft ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",57
"58","—No, I don't remember any that had a very large holding; an ordinary croft.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",58
"59","34126. You remember perfectly well the time that has been spoken of to-day when the people were removed and went away to America ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",59
"60","—Yes.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",60
"61","34127. Was it entirely of their own free will that those people went away ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",61
"62","—So far as I know, many of them went away of their own free will.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",62
"63","34128. Did the whole of them go of their own free will?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",63
"64","—I am not aware.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",64
"65","34129. Are you aware that many of those who emigrated were in arrear of rent when they went away ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",65
"66","—I believe some of them were in arrear. I know others went away and sold the croft. The phrase 'selling the croft' means of course selling the crops and the stock and the houses; but there is also something of the nature of goodwill that perhaps is rather difficult to explain—a sense of possession that grew. One would give more for the crops because he was to enter into possession of the land.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",66
"67","34130. You heard the things that were said to have been done under the management of the former factor?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",67
"68","—Yes, I heard, and I saw the men.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",68
"69","34131. Are you aware that there was great dissatisfaction with the management among the people ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",69
"70","—Yes, I know that there was great dissatisfaction, but whether the cause of that might be justified of course",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",70
"71","would be another matter. The people spoke of great dissatisfaction. I had no land at the time; I was young and without care, and did not take much heed of the matter.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",71
"72","34132. Were you aware of many people that were able to come well out the distress following the potato disease in Tyree ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",72
"73","—Yes.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",73
"74","34133. And are there some of those in the place yet?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",74
"75","—Yes.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",75
"76","34134. And have they bigger holdings now than they had then?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",76
"77","—There are plenty of their descendants still in the place.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",77
"78","34135. There have been a good number of large farms made since that time ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",78
"79","—They were made about that time.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",79
"80","34136. And do you think the people would have been better off  if they had got the lands of the crofters who went away instead of these lands being turned into big farms ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",80
"81","—I know that some of them would be very glad to have them anyhow, and would be able to take them. Others would not have been able to take them.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",81
"82","34137. Those who pay rent from £30 upwards like yourself, are they not in a better position than those who have the small crofts ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",82
"83","—They are in a much better position.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",83
"84","34138. In a bad year like last year those people did not require assistance?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",84
"85","—Well, they are all present here, those who asked assistance last year. Each man can answer for himself in that respect, but I neither required nor asked for assistance.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",85
"86","34139. Between those who have laud and those who have not, are those who have no land much poorer than those who have ?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",86
"87","—Some of those who have no land are quite as well off as some of those who have. Some of them in the cottar class, with a trade or the like of that, are better off than the poorer of the crofter class.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",87
"88","34140. But take them class for class?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",88
"89","—Any person can understand which class is best off; of course it is the crofter class.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",89
"90","34141. And the bigger the croft the better he is off?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",90
"91","—The small crofter invariably says so.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",91
"92","34142. But does the big crofter say the opposite?",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",92
"93","—Well, he would get the opportunity of having his choice pretty often if he did say it. It could be turned to a small croft any day if he pleased.",567,"Lachlan Mcphail","Argyll, Tyree",93
