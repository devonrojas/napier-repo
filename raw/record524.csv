"1","MURDO MACRAE, Cottar, Morvich (58)—examined.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",1
"2","31183. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",2
"3","—Have you been elected by the cottars of Morvich ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",3
"4","—I was.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",4
"5","31184. How many of them were at the meeting?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",5
"6","—Twenty, but they were not all there. I have a statement which I wish to read.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",6
"7","31185. Is that statement on behalf of the whole of the cottars?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",7
"8","—Yes, from the whole of them included in the forest",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",8
"9","—' Parish of Glenshiel, Estate of Kintail. The following delegates have been appointed to lay before the Royal Commission the case of the cottars on what was the farm of Morvich, and is now included in the deer forest of MrWinans, viz., Murdoch Macrae, Alexander Maclennan, and Duncan Macrae. They beg to submit the following statement, and are prepared to answer any questions bearing thereon or on any matters relating to their position, on which information may be desired. On this land there are nineteen houses, in seven of which there is only one inmate in each. In the remaining twelve there are families of from two to eight persons. Among all these there are less than four acres of land available for growing potatoes or other crop. For the use of such portions as they had of this land such as were able gave work to the value of £ 1 per annum to the tenants and latterly to the proprietor. Five have cows, for which £3 per annum each was paid for liberty to graze on the farm. All the lands of Morvich and Inchewe have been let to Mr AVinans, who has endeavoured to compel the proprietor to turn all the cottars out of house and home. The history of the "" Kintail Crofters "" case is so well known that it need not be further referred to. The proprietor does not seem to have made any stipulation in his agreement with Mr A Winans for their being allowed to remain on the ground, which he might easily have done. While the cottars can scarcely get a bit of land in which to grow a little food, there are many acres of excellent arable land at Morvich, which are admirably adapted for the use of crofters, and which might have been given to them without any damage to the deer forest. Of this land no use whatever is being made at present. Some of it is covered with weeds, and many acres (about 30) are under a most luxuriant crop of clover and grasses, which has been allowed to rot on the ground, and is actually offensive to the senses of people who pass along the road. Since the farm has been turned into a desert no employment of any kind is given to the cottars. Not one of them is even employed to walk over the ground and turn deer, every person employed being brought from a distance. The cottars are in great poverty, and are most anxious to have a reasonable amount of land—and some security against being turned out of the houses they have erected for themselves.'",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",9
"10","31186. Was this paper read at any meeting of the cottars at Morvich?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",10

"20","31191. In what position were you before that time?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",20
"21","—The farmer at that time sub-let £50 worth of land to ten tenants, which enabled them to keep one cow each, but when he saw fit he took this land from them.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",21
"22","31192. Who was this farmer?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",22
"23","—One Alexander Macrae, Torloisich.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",23

"25","—No, the same man who gave the land took it away.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",25

"27","—-I cannot tell that; they had it before I remember.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",27
"28","31195. What was the cause of its being taken away ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",28
"29","—I cannot give any reason for that either, only that he preferred to have it in his own hands.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",29
"30","31196. Was there ever a time when these cottars were themselves tenants of the farm of Morvich ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",30
"31","—I should think not, but our fathers were paying direct to the proprietor.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",31
"32","31197. Had your fathers the whole of the farm of Morvich ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",32

"48","—We have expressed a wish to that effect to the proprietor, Mr Mackenzie.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",48

"56","—Yes, shearing, smearing, and wintering hoggs in the low countiy.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",56
"57","31209. And since that farm has been changed into a forest you get no work at all ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",57
"58","—No.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",58

"68","—Yes, with the right to outrun for cattle.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",68
"69","31215. Don't you think it might possibly have a great effect, and could at any rate do no harm, if you were to write to Mr Winans stating that you are now in a position you never were in before, and were anxious to get a little pasture for a cow—make a written application to Mr Winans to give you these advantages ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",69
"70","—It would be of no use; he does not allow his own gamekeepers to keep a cow ; I don't believe he would give grazing for a hogg to any one.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",70
"71","31216. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",71

"81","—Yes, and he did not put us off, but he might help us still.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",81

"85","—He did.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",85
"86","31223. What did he do for you?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",86
"87","—We did not know but we might still get the land we desired; he gave us some nets and a little money and a boat.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",87
"88","31224. Was the next stage of the proceedings that you learned the place had been let for a forest ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",88
"89","—Quite so.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",89
"90","31225. Did you know at the time the first application for that land was made whether it was let for a forest or not ? ",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",90
"91","—We did not know until we heard it was to be let as a forest.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",91
"92","31226. Are you aware, or have you heard, that the proprietor entered into a lease with Mr Winans ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",92
"93","—We did not know it at the time, but we have ascertained since.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",93
"94","31227. Was the lease signed after the people made application to the proprietor ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",94
"95","—It seems it was settled before we thought; the lease was signed before we thought. ",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",95
"96","31228. Was there any reservation of the rights of the people in that lease ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",96
"97","—I don't know as to that.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",97
"98","31229. Are you aware that Mr Winans has claimed the right to turn the people all out ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",98
"99","—I know that.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",99
"100","31230. What right can Mr Winans have to turn you out unless he derives that right from the proprietor?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",100
"101","—I don't think he can expel us unless he gets the proprietor's authority.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",101
"102","31231. Would it be any damage or loss to the proprietor or to the sporting tenant to let these people have what they originally ask?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",102

"108","—Down to the middle of the glen.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",108
"109","31234. Then, in point of fact, they are making no use of the grass, which is going to nought ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",109
"110","—It is rotting on the ground there.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",110
"111","31235. Is there any fence between the farm and any part of the deer forest ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",111
"112","—Only a piece at the end of Loch Duich.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",112

"116","—Of course we would require to have a fence.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",116
"117","31238. What would the extent of it need to be?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",117
"118","—About half a mile.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",118

"120","—The arable ground.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",120
"121","31240. And for the pasture how much fencing would be required, supposing you got as much as would keep a cow or two each ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",121
"122","—They would require a mile in extent.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",122

"129","—I cannot tell how many acres; it is miles in extent.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",129
"130","31244. At that time was there deer upon the upper ground?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",130
"131","—Yes, there was deer.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",131

"133","—Yes.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",133

"139","—They were ; they have ever been there.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",139

"145","—I suppose they would be; if not it would be their own fault.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",145

"147","—They might without any harm.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",147

"149","—They would not, I believe.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",149
"150","31254. I suppose even although you got these lands you could not put the necessary stock upon them?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",150
"151","—I believe it would be very difficult for some of us.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",151
"152","31255. There are some about who could put the necessary stock upon the lands yet ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",152
"153","—I believe some of them could.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",153
"154","31256. And supposing you get all the ground you want to get, there would be sufficient room for the deer forest ?",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",154
"155","—Yes, it would not in the least spoil the deer forest.",524,"Murdo Macrae","Inverness-shire, Glenshiel, Letterfearn",155
