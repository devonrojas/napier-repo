"1","Mr ALEXANDER MACDONALD, Factor for Lord Macdonald—examined. ",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",1
"2","13.  The Chairman.",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",2
"3","—You are at liberty to speak if you desire to make any observations?",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",3
"4","—In the first place, I may say that I am surprised at this man's statement, because he is not one of our crofters at all. He is a crofter's son; he is not a crofter. That is the first thing. In the next place, I do not think that he has any reason whatever, or that any person has any reason whatever, if he tells the truth, and nothing but the truth, to fear anything. In fact, we consider it rather insulting to us to insinuate anything of the sort. We despise to do anything of the sort. We expect and trust that the men will tell the truth and nothing but the truth, and the whole truth. ",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",4
"5","14. There is something rather ambiguous in the statement which you have made. Am I to understand that you publicly state that no proceeding will be taken against any tenant or inhabitant of this place in consequence of what they state before the Commission on this occasion?",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",5
"6","—I believe not. ",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",6
"7","15. You say you believe not, but do you engage that no proceedings will be taken?",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",7
"8","—That is all I can state: on my own property certainly there will not be, and, I believe, on no property. In fact, such an idea never entered our heads; but we expect the people will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. ",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",8
"9","16. Mr Cameron.",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",9
"10","—Would you engage on behalf of the proprietors for whom you act; for all properties with which you are connected?",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",10
"11","—Most certainly; but this I would say, if we hear any man making a grossly false statement against us, which we can prove to be false, I do not think that in human nature it would be found we should like to continue that man as our tenant. If there is any statement which is made by a man thinking and believing it to be true, even though we ourselves differ from it, we would never dream of using any power that we have, but if the man tells a parcel of unfounded lies—which I do not believe any man here or elsewhere in Skye will do until I hear it—that is a different matter altogether. So far as we are concerned the people have full liberty to tell everything they have to say, without any fear. ",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",11
"12","17. The Chairman.",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",12
"13","—If you are able to do so I would rather that you availed yourself of this occasion to make a distinct declaration that whatever the people say no proceeding will ever be taken against them on that account,—that on this particular occasion whatever they may say, however mistaken you may think them, however erroneous or false, no proceeding will be attempted?",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",13
"14","—These are my own personal feelings, and certainly so far as the properties for which I am factor are concerned they will never know or hear anything about it—so far as I, as factor, am concerned. ",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",14
"15","18. Then I am authorised by you to assure this gentleman before me that nothing will ever be done to his prejudice on this occasion?",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",15
"16","—I expect that he will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and so far as I am concerned as factor, I will visit in no way anything upon him, and I believe Lord Macdonald will do nothing. ",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",16
"17","19. Mr Cameron.",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",17
"18","—You have heard what this witness has said, that except under certain conditions he refuses to give us evidence. We have been appointed by the Queen to investigate this subject thoroughly, and it is impossible that we can do so unless we get proper evidence from witnesses such as Mr Angus Stewart. Now, I am sure you would not Macdonald, wish that the evidence should fail to be recorded from any disinclination on your part to give the assurance which has been asked by the chairman ",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",18
"19","— I give him the fullest assurance. ",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",19
"20","20. And I think all we wish was contained in the observation which I formerly made, namely, that so far as concerns the estates under your management nothing shall happen to any witness in consequence of any statement which he may make, whether you consider it truthful or not, before this Commission. If you give that assurance we may at once proceed ?",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",20
"21","—Certainly we expect the man to tell the truth. ",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",21
"22","21. The Chairman.",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",22
"23","—But let us come to a point on this matter. Will you state yes or no in reply to my question,—will you authorise me to state absolutely to this man that nothing will ever be done prejudicial to his interest or that of his family in consequence of anything he may say on this occasion? ",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",23
"24","—I believe I am quite at liberty to say so. I believe I am perfectly at liberty to say so, and from the first I could have said so.",2,"Alexander Macdonald","Skye, Braes",24
