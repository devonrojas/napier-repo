"2","(See Appendix A, LXIV.)",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",2
"3","25400. Sheriff Nicolson.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",3
"4","—Were you freely elected a delegate?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",4
"5","—Yes. ",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",5
"6","25401. Was there a number of people present at your election?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",6
"7","—Yes. At a public meeting of crofters and cottars held in Dalhalvag Schoolhouse on Wednesday, 4th July 1883, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted with the view of laying them before the Royal Commission :—",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",7
"8","1st, That the people ask enlarged holdings at fair rents, and for this purpose pray for the breaking down of large sheep farms.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",8
"9","2nd, That the people ask the Government to give them security in their holdings. ",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",9
"10","3rd, That compensation for improvements be given to any tenant removing of his own accord.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",10
"11","(Signed) WILLIAM M'KENZIE, secretary and delegate, and by fifty-three crofters, crofters' sons, and",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",11
"12","cottars",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",12
"13","25402. What is the number of families liviug in the district to which you belong?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",13
"14","—Sixty-five.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",14
"15","25403. How many of these are crofters?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",15
"16","—Fifty-one and fourteen cottars.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",16
"17","25404. Are the crofts much of an average in size?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",17
"18","—No, they vary in size.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",18
"19","25405. What do the rents average?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",19
"20","—I should say they will average about £5, 10s.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",20
"21","25406. What is the highest rent you know?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",21
"22","—About £20, but I am not exactly sure.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",22
"23","25407. And the lowest?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",23
"24","—About £2, 10s. or £2, 6s.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",24
"25","25408. What stock will a man keep on a £2, 10s. croft?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",25
"26","—A very small stock indeed. He can perhaps keep a cow by buying additional provender, and two or three sheep or even half a dozen.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",26
"27","25409. Are there any of them who live upon the produce of their crofts?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",27
"28","—Yes, I believe there are.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",28
"29","25410. Do the majority of them do so?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",29
"30","—No, a small minority of them only.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",30
"31","25411. How do those whose land is not sufficient to maintain them, live?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",31
"32","—They just struggle through the world some way or another. They go to work in all quarters of the world, and gather money to support their families.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",32
"33","25412. How do the cottars live?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",33
"34","—Some of them are paupers; others live by labouring in different places, and at different kinds of work.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",34
"35","25413. Is there any work to be had in the neighbourhood?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",35
"36","—No, there is no public work in the meantime.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",36
"37","25414. What kind of houses have the crofters generally?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",37
"38","—Some of them have very good cottages and others very miserable, the worst on the estate, I believe.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",38
"39","25415. Are many of them very poor houses'?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",39
"40","—I should say about half of the houses are very bad. ",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",40
"41","Are they old houses?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",41
"42","—Yes, I believe they have been built by the grandfathers of the present crofters, or perhaps at an earlier date.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",42
"43","25416. Do the people get any encouragement to improve their houses?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",43
"44","—Yes. They get lime from his Grace the Duke of Sutherland, and timber for the roof, but nothing else, so far as I am aware.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",44
"45","25417. Do any of them keep cattle in the same houses with themselves?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",45
"46","—Yes, I know instances of cattle going in at the same door, and no partition being between the people and the cattle.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",46
"47","25418. But I suppose there are not many such?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",47
"48","—There are two or three so far as I can recollect, but only two or three.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",48
"49","25419. Do you consider the present rents too high?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",49
"50","—No, I don't consider the rent per acre too high, but I consider that the holdings are so small, that the rent would be far too high, although the men paid in fact nothing at all.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",50
"51","25420. Can you give an estimate of what it is per acre?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",51
"52","—I would say about £ 1 , or perhaps a little more for the arable land, and the hill pasture besides.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",52
"53","25421. Have you plenty of hill pasture?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",53
"54","—There is a good deal of hill pasture. The fifty-one crofts, I should say, will have about twelve square miles of hill pasture, but a great deal of that is worse than useless. It would be better under the sea.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",54
"55","25422. All moor?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",55
"56","—Yes, it is full of bogs and bad pools for drowning their sheep.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",56
"57","25423. Is there any limit to the number of sheep a man may keep?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",57
"58","—No, they are not limited; but they are limited in this respect, that a man can only keep them by being at great expense. The lot I occupy would not keep more than two-thirds of my present stock without outside keep.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",58
"59","25424. Are there any large farms near?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",59
"60","—Yes, both ends of Strath Halladale are occupied by one farmer, Mr Paterson, Bighouse.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",60
"61","25425. Is your land fenced from his?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",61
"62","—No.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",62
"63","25426. Does that lead to any disadvantage or injury to your crops?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",63
"64","—In former times it did, but now the inconvenience is quite inconsiderable.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",64
"65","25427. You don't want a fence?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",65
"66","—No, I don't hear any complaint with regard to that.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",66
"67","25428. All the crofters have at least one cow, have they not?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",67
"68","—Yes, so far as I know.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",68
"69","25429. Are the cottars able also to keep cows?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",69
"70","—I am not aware of any cottar who has a cow in Strath Halladale.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",70
"71","25430. Have the cottars been long there?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",71
"72","—Yes, some of them, and others only a short period—three or four years.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",72
"73","25431. Where have they come from?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",73
"74","—They are generally natives of the place.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",74
"75","25432. Has the number of crofters in Strath Halladale increased within the last twenty or thirty years?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",75
"76","—Very slightly. One or two lots have been subdivided since that period—one that I am aware of.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",76
"77","25433. Is subdivision allowed by the laws of the estate?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",77
"78","—No, and it is not practised in our locality.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",78
"79","25434. You are some distance from the sea?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",79
"80","—I should say the nearest tenant would be 3½  miles from the sea.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",80
"81","25435. Then I suppose there are no fishermen among you?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",81
"82","—No.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",82
"83","25436. Have you plenty of peats?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",83
"84","—Yes, but they are very difficult to get.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",84
"85","25437. Do you keep horses?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",85
"86","—We keep ponies.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",86
"87","25438. Has every crofter a pony?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",87
"88","—No, I believe there is a considerable number without them.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",88
"89","25439. Is your inconvenience with regard to the peats that they are far away?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",89
"90","—They are not far away, but Strath Halladale is a deep valley, and there are high hills on each side,- and it is very difficult to carry the peats over these high rough hills.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",90
"91","25440. Do you carry them on horses?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",91
"92","—In carts.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",92
"93","25441. The women are not obliged to carry them?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",93
"94","—A considerable part of the way they are—in the worst parts; they have to carry them on their backs.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",94
"95","25442. Do you use horses in ploughing, or do you dig with a spade?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",95
"96","—The horses plough all the crofts, so far as I am aware.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",96
"97","25443. I suppose the use of the crooked spade has gone out long ago?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",97
"98","—Yes.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",98
"99","25444. How long ago?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",99
"100","—I have never seen it.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",100
"101","25445. And the women are not employed in harrowing, as they are in some of the islands?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",101
"102","—Not now.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",102
"103","25146. Did they use to be?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",103
"104","—I have seen instances of it, but not many.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",104
"105","25447. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",105
"106","—You mention that you want enlarged crofts; the last witness from Melness stated that there would be very few people capable of taking such crofts without help—how would that be in your district?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",106
"107","— I know I could take one if I could get it at a reasonable rent.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",107
"108","25448. There are fifty-one crofters—would all those who have small crofts be able to take large ones?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",108
"109","—Not all, but I believe a considerable number of them would by getting some assistance in the way of building houses and so forth.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",109
"110","25449. Would they require assistance to stock the crofts?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",110
"111","—I believe they would manage to buy it by their credit, and some of them have friends who would lend them money and so forth. They would try a great many means to stock the ground.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",111
"112","25450. What do you consider a reasonable-sized croft? What rent would it be as rents go?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",112
"113","—The land is very bad in the district; it is generally overflowed by the river.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",113
"114","25451. You said you did not think the land over-rented if you had a sufficient quantity of i t; what do you consider would be the rent of a fair sized croft?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",114
"115","—I would consider a fair sized croft one of ten acres.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",115
"116","25452. That would be about £10; would you consider that sufficient to keep a man?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",116
"117","—It would be rather small in some cases; it would depend on the nature of the land. The land varies a great deal in different parts of the Strath.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",117
"118","25453. How many crofters are there in Strath Halladale paying less than £12 a year?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",118
"119","—I should say that all pay less than that with one exeception.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",119
"120","25454. There is only one paying £20 of rent?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",120
"121","—Yes.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",121
"122","25455. And you think the half of these would be able to take proper sized crofts?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",122
"123","—I should think they would.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",123
"124","25456. Mention was made of the Loch laws, which I presume means the regulations of the estate; do you know anything about these regulations?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",124
"125","—No, but the estate of Strath Halladale belonged to the Mackays of Bighouse down to 1830, and all the evictions in that quarter took place prior to that date. We have nothing bad to say of the house of Sutherland as a community; in fact, the house of Sutherland has benefited us. But this has been a small estate before, and the tenants had been rack-rented prior to the property coming into the hands of the Sutherland family. And besides being rack-rented they had to do a great deal of feudal service which his Grace the Duke of Sutherland did away with.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",125
"126","25457. Are you subject to annoyance from the officials on the estate?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",126
"127","—There are cases of that.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",127
"128","25458. Are there any estate regulations of which you have heard, and of which you don't really know the meaning?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",128
"129","—We are ignorant about the regulations, but some of them are rather sharply exercised amongst us. For instance, a man is is banished off the estate for killing grouse.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",129
"130","25459. Are there any printed rules?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",130
"131","—We never got our hands upon any printed rules.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",131
"132","25460. But you know if you are found shooting game you have to go?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",132
"133","—Yes, it is generally the case. [See Appendix A, LXIV]",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",133
"134","25461. Are there any other rules you complain of?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",134
"135","—We would desire security against the raising of our rent so that we cannot live.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",135
"136","25462. I mean are there any rules on the estate you complain of, besides that with reference to the shooting of game?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",136
"137","—It is a rule of the estate that the officials can fix the rent, and do anything they please, and that is considered a great grievance by many of the crofters.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",137
"138","25463. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",138
"139","—Is Strath Halladale a large district?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",139
"140","—I t is about fifteen miles long.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",140
"141","25464. You say that the crofters are in the middle of the glen, and a tenant above them, and a tenant below them?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",141
"142","—The same tenant occupies both ends.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",142
"143","25465. Were there many people removed in the time of the Mackays of Bighouse?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",143
"144","—A great many. I cannot specify the number, but it would be considerable.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",144
"145","25466. What became of them?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",145
"146","—Some of them were planted amongst those who lived in the place where the crofters are now, and that was the occasion of the overcrowding.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",146
"147","25467. And others had to leave altogether, I presume?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",147
"148","—Others left the estate altogether; some went abroad, and others went to Caithness.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",148
"149","25468. Do the people you represent, represent the whole of Strath Halladale?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",149
"150","—Yes; I was elected at a public meeting.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",150
"151","25469. Do you know the rental of the parish of Reay in this county?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",151
"152","—I should say it was something about £3000, or perhaps a little over it.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",152
"153","25470. How much of that does Mr Paterson the large tenant pay?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",153
"154","—Well nigh on £2000, I understand, including shooting.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",154
"155","25471. I suppose the people don't consider that a very fair division, do they?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",155
"156","—Far from it.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",156
"157","25472. Have your people been in the place where you are for a long time?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",157
"158","—My father and grandfather were evicted from Strathnaver about seventy years ago, and planted in Strathhalladalemore, and the lot they then got was divided between other two tenants, and my  grandfather had to labour for a time.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",158
"159","25473. You have sometimes heard it alleged, have you not, that it was for the benefit of the people that all these great clearances took place seventy years ago?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",159
"160","—Yes, but it is a great mistake.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",160
"161","25474. Are the crofters generally now upon the Sutherland estates rather poor?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",161
"162","—They are very poor in general.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",162
"163","25475. And after seventy years experience of these removals, don't you think that the system of turning them out of these glens, and putting them down by the sea shore, was a great mistake?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",163
"164","—Yes.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",164
"165","25476. Mr Cumming stated that a good number of people emigrate, because they cannot find anything to do here. Is that consistent with your observation?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",165
"166","—Yes, but the people are so poor in our place, that they seldom leave t h e country, and the population does not increase much. A few emigrants leave every year, but very few, the population is about 300.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",166
"167","25477. Does the going away of these emigrants benefit those who remain behind?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",167
"168","—In many cases they support those they leave behind.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",168
"169","25478. Does the emigration of these young men do any good to those that are left behind?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",169
"170","—No further than that they support the families at home very often, after they leave.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",170
"171","25479. By sending money?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",171
"172","—Yes, and by helping in various ways.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",172
"173","25480. Is it a common thing in your part for a croft to be actually vacant, so that the neighbours may get it?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",173
"174","—It is never heard of.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",174
"175","25481. I suppose whatever difficulties there may be in providing crofters with bigger crofts, in some places there would be no difficulty in providing your people with large crofts, because there is a big farm above you and below you ?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",175
"176","—I don't suppose there would be any difficulty.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",176
"177","25482. You would not require to move many miles'?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",177
"178","—No.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",178
"179","25483. You said that the part that is occupied by the crofters is not very good land in some cases, and is liable to flooding; is the upper part of the glen, where the people once were removed from, a sound healthy place?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",179
"180","—Yes.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",180
"181","25484. And if anybody walked up through it to the head they would find a great many remains of ruined houses, where the people once lived?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",181
"182","—A great many.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",182
"183","25485. Not now turned over by the plough at all, but lying waste under sheep?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",183
"184","—Fast going to waste at any rate.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",184
"185","25486. The Chairman.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",185
"186","—You stated that there were some houses in your place in which the entrance was through the byre or cow shed?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",186
"187","—That is so.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",187
"188","25487. You also stated that there was some, in which there was no division between the cow shed and the dwelling rooms?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",188
"189","—There is one I know, and I fancy there is another one or two.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",189
"190","25488. You mean there is no partition between the byre and the kitchen?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",190
"191","—None whatever.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",191
"192","25489. Was that the case long ago in the old Caithness and Sutherland houses?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",192
"193","—It was the case in my first recollection in the greater number of houses in Strath Halladale.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",193
"194","25490. Are those houses that still remain in that condition, the houses of crofters or cottars?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",194
"195","—Crofters' houses.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",195
"196","25491. Do you know whether any application has been made, in connection with those houses, to have new houses built?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",196
"197","—The people cannot build them, and therefore don't apply.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",197
"198","25492. But we heard that assistance was given to build new houses'?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",198
"199","—With that assistance they cannot do it. A tenant was removed on that account nine years ago from my neighbourhood.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",199
"200","25493. Why?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",200
"201","—Because he would not build a new house upon the croft his father had before him; and there was a good house already upon the place.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",201
"202","25494. Why did they want him to build a new house if there was a good one already?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",202
"203","—That is a question I cannot answer, but the fact is clear, the tenant had to leave the place on account of his not building a house.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",203
"204","25495. You said that one of the regulations on the estate was, that crofters were removed for killing a grouse. Do you mean that in the case of a first offence against the game laws, or one offence, a crofter would be removed with his family from a holding?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",204
"205","—I am aware of one case only. There have been other cases, but I cannot specify them in the meantime.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",205
"206","25496. In which for a first offence—a first act of poaching—a man was removed?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",206
"207","—Yes, so far as I know. [See Appendix A, LXIV]",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",207
"208","25497. Were they cases of single men or men with families'?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",208
"209","—It was a case of a married man assisting his father-in-law in keeping the croft in order.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",209
"210","25498. A married man assisting his father-in-law—was he properly the occupier or tenant of the croft?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",210
"211","—He was not the tenant of the croft, but likely to become so. ",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",211
"212","25499. I am rather particular upon this point, are you acquainted with any case of a man actually an occupier of a croft being removed from his holding on account of poaching or killing game at all?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",212
"213","—I cannot recollect any case from memory just now.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",213
"214","25500. Either for one offence, or more than one offence?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",214
"215","—I cannot in the meantime say; but there have been such cases in the past.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",215
"216","25501. Are offences against the game laws common or uncommon?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",216
"217","—Not common.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",217
"218","25502. What is your opinion generally, about the state of the people from what you have heard?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",218
"219","—Are the people in your place better off on the whole than they used to be,—better fed, and better clothed, or are they poorer, and worse off?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",219
"220","—I should say one-third of them are better off than the crofters I see anywhere here about. And another third of them exist someway or another, and the remaining third live in misery and poverty.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",220
"221","25503. But are they better off than the last generation—than their fathers and grandfathers, or are they worse off?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",221
"222","—They are not better off by any means.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",222
"223","25504. Do you see any improvement going on in the way of building and fencing and so on?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",223
"224","—A good deal.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",224
"225","25505. Is there any improvement in the breed of cattle —are the cattle bigger and better than they were t",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",225
"226","—His Grace the Duke of Sutherland gives a bull to the tenants which improves the breed considerably; still the animals are of an inferior breed. ,",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",226
"227","25506. And the sheep?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",227
"228","—The sheep are inferior to those upon the sheep farm in the neighbourhood, owing to the over-stocking.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",228
"229","25507. Do you think your arable and pasture ground generally is decidedly of worse quality than the arable and pasture land in the hands, of the sheep farmer; or are they much about the same?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",229
"230","—The district in which I live is much worse than any part I know, so far as pasture is concerned, for sheep or cattle.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",230
"231","25508. Do you think that the best pasture was deliberately taken for the purpose of forming the sheep farms, or was it an accident?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",231
"232","—It was deliberately taken.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",232
"233","25509. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",233
"234","—Why were a few people left, when the others were removed from up and down the glen?",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",234
"235","—The only answer I can give is that, I suppose their places were scarcely worth coveting at that",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",235
"236","time.",426,"William Mackenzie","Sutherland, Bettyhill",236
