"1","JOHN M'CORMICK, Crofter, Catchean (55), assisted by JOHN M'KINNON, Crofter, Catchean (33)—examined.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",1
"2","34532. Mr Cameron.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",2
"3","—Have you a written statement?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",3
"4","—I have.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",4
"5","—The principal of our grievances is the high rent put on us for our holdings, and the excess of stock assigned to our pasturage since the year 1850. Our township consists of twelve crofts. One holds three crofts, one two half crofts, one two crofts, four single crofts, and three half crofts each, paying a rental of from £4 to £27. The average rental before 1850 was £ 3 , 15s. A crofter holding five crofts, and paying a rental of £18, 15s., lost almost all his stock by the biting of rabid dogs, brought to the place by the gamekeeper. He was advised by the chamberlain to make his case known to his Grace, which was done after a copy was provided by himself. The crofter restocked in full; but the proprietor acknowledged his petition by a summons of removal depriving him of three crofts. A settlement was refused, and he was obliged to bring his stock of three crofts to Bunessan for sale. The auctioneer was prohibited by the factor from crying the sale, which left the alternative of selling to his own drover, at a disadvantage; and the rental of the two remaining crofts was, moreover, raised to £10. The crofts taken away were cropped by the proprietor for two years, after which they with two other vacated crofts were turned into common grassing, while the rental of the two crofts in his possession was further raised to £18, and the stock from two to four cows. Subsequently the crofts were relet to crofters at the raised rent, and increased stock. A quarry was opened about twenty years ago; in connection with it a croft was given for grassing for manager's cow, and horses required in the quarry, and the common was put to the crofters. At a later time four crofts and a strip with a portion of the common was marked off for the quarry, and still later two additional were made over to them, occupied by the crofters as sub-tenants with their rent raised, which in itself is a grievance. The quarry is the cause of much damage, and no compensation given or allowed. In 1874 or 1875 a croft was taken off our common, cutting off free access to our stock watering-place. A system for diminishing our means to pay our rent is in progress by giving sites and attaching lands for another rent. Our pasturage is now been for one-half the stock assigned to it. The harsh and cruel law of evictions, formerly used, has now given way to the more modern and refined mode of grinding away our subject, by diminishing our means, which will eventually serve the purpose of bringing us into abject poverty. The discouraging treatment to which the peasant was subject was, and is, deemed sufficient prohibition to lawful wedlock. The writer hereof is an instance. The population of this parish, including Iona quoad sacra, was in 1841, 5197; in 1871, 2461; in 1881, 1990. Notwithstanding the enormous decrease of population, the poverty of the remnant crofters is as enormously increasing. Thirty years ago eleven famdies including one cottar were all the occupants of this township, now there are twenty-two, all paying rent, and six of them only for houses. At one time unprotected patches were sown in a large piece of the common, which was the cause of two crofters dropping off our petition, for an amicable way of arranging rent was refused in 1881.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",5

"54","—We do not consider it a benefit at all; it would be some twentyfive years ago, or not so long.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",54
"55","34557. But before that time there was no wintering of hoggs? ",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",55
"56","—No none.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",56
"57","34558 Will you explain how that is no benefit ?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",57
"58","—Because our pasturage is bare enough without that.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",58
"59","34559. That might he no benefit to the man who owns the hoggs, but it is no disadvantage to you ?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",59

"62","—All the rent we got for the hogs goes to the Duke as a rise.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",62
"63","34561 But wouldn't it explain in some way the rise?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",63
"64","—But that destroys the grazing.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",64
"65","34562. But it is a clear benefit to you getting £2?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",65
"66","—Of course, in the circumstances, it is; but it is spoiling the summer grazing.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",66
"67","34563. But you are not compelled by the factor to do it ?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",67

"86","—-He was.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",86
"87","34573. You say a quarry was opened about twenty years ago, and in connection with it a croft was given for grazing the manager's cow and  horses required in the quarry, and the common was put to the crofters.

"218","—Yes; if we could get rid of the rent, we would soon get rid of them.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",218

"307","34679. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",307
"308","—I suppose you are obliged to let the wintering of the croft, because the high rent makes it necessary you should make the most money out of the croft ?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",308
"309","—That is the very reason. ",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",309
"310","34680. If your rent was less wouldn't you try still to make the most money out of it?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",310
"311","—I would endeavour to make more out of my own stock; it deteriorates our grazing.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",311
"312","34681. But whether your rent is high or low your endeavour is to make .the most money possible out of the croft ?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",312
"313","—Yes, but we make more money by raising our own stock.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",313
"314","34682. If you would make more money in that way, why do you make less money by having this wintering stock in?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",314
"315","—We were bound to take them in once, but we continue now from necessity.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",315
"316","34683. You were bound by the regulations of the property ?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",316
"317","—I am not aware; but we were bound by the factor.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",317

"326","34688. He did not let it ; he took possession of your crofts, in fact?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",326
"327","—He let it to them, and put in a stock of hoggs.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",327
"328","34689. And did that man pay any rent for it to anybody ?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",328
"329","—No, because when Mr Campbell died the crofters put in an account to the trustees, and the trustees declined to pay it, and then it was sent to Mr Wyllie.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",329
"330","34690. And Mr Wyllie knew about it ?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",330

"335","—Yes.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",335
"336","34693. How could you do that ?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",336
"337","—The old townships that have been cleared into large farms, if they were given to the people now, there would be quite sufficient for all the people of Ross.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",337
"338","34694. Reduce the large farms ?",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",338

"348","—Yes, and not only that, but the neighbour's did it too.",576,"John Mccormick, John Mckinnon","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",348
