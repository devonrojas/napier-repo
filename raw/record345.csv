"5","19209. Is that four acres?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",5

"16","—Generally about five months.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",16
"17","19215. Have you any partners with you in the fishing?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",17
"18","—There is a boat's crew.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",18
"19","19216. Does the boat belong to yourselves?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",19
"20","—Not at present.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",20
"21","19217. But you hope to buy the boat?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",21
"22","—If times would improve.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",22
"23","19218. Has the fishing been pretty good for the last few years?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",23
"24","—No, very small.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",24
"25","19219. How many boats are there in your district?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",25
"26","—Only two at the present time, but there are a good many employed in other boats.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",26
"27","19220. How many families ate there in your district?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",27
"28","—Pretty near about thirty.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",28
"29","19221. Are they nearly all employed in fishing?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",29
"30","—The most of them.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",30
"31","19222. Men and boys?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",31
"32","—Yes; of course, there are a few not.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",32
"33","19223. Do the women get any employment in gutting herring?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",33
"34","—No, there are a few of them over here, but not many.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",34
"35","19224. Do they attend to the farm work when the men are away?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",35
"36","—Yes.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",36
"37","19225. What do they do?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",37
"38","—Keep the ground clear and keep the weeds out of it, and attend to the cattle.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",38
"39","19226. How do you cultivate your farm?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",39
"40","—We dig it with spades.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",40
"41","19227. Do you harrow it?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",41
"42","—Yes.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",42
"43","19228. Do the women harrow it?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",43
"44","—Both women and men sometimes.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",44
"45","19229. Have you a sufficient amount of scathold for the crop that you can grow ?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",45
"46","—Yes, we have the full privilege of the hill pasture along with the arable ground.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",46
"47","19230. Are you as well off as you were a few years ago?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",47
"48","—Not at all; we are much aggrieved for our small boundary, and we are confined in our property. We would like a Government valuation; we think our rent too high, and we are confined in our holdings.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",48
"49","19231. What do you mean by that?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",49
"50","—Our land is lying in small. patches twenty yards square, and five or six tenants come in amongst these again, and then we have another patch, and we cannot have the benefit of it. The land is not in any one spot.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",50
"51","19232. You are talking of arable ground?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",51
"52","—Yes.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",52
"53","19233. Would it not be possible to consolidate the ground so as to give each tenant arable ground in the immediate neighbourhood of his own house?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",53
"54","—Quite possible.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",54
"55","19234. Who is your landlord?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",55
"56","—Mr Basil Hastie Robertson.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",56
"57","19235. Who is the factor?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",57
"58","—Mr Keith.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",58
"59","19236. Has any representation ever been made to them about that?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",59
"60","—Yes.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",60
"61","19237. What reply was given?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",61
"62","—The reply was that the land was to be laid out in lots, and it has been done, but we have never occupied it —we have never had the privilege of occupying it",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",62
"63","19238. You say it has been conceded to you by Mr Keith that the land should be consolidated ?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",63
"64","—Yes, and it was done; but somehow or other it belongs to two different landlords; there is a Mrs Robertson, who owns some as well Basil Sinclair.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",64
"65","19239. Is she the wife of Mr Robertson?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",65
"66","—She was the wife of the late Mr Robertson, and she has a share in the property.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",66
"67","19240. Is the property under trust?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",67
"68","—I think so.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",68
"69","19241. And the factor manages the property for the proprietor or proprietors, whoever they may be?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",69
"70","—Yes.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",70
"71","19242. Explain how it is, if you applied to the factor and he made a revaluation and redistribution of the land, why that arrangement was not carried out?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",71
"72","—That is what we cannot exactly understand, because the proprietors apparently could not agree, as the land was mixed.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",72
"73","19243. If you went to the proprietors for a reduction of rent I could understand that they might not agree, but if it were merely a question of redistribution for the convenience of the people, I don't understand why the proprietors could not agree to what the factor had already sanctioned?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",73
"74","—-Our proprietor agreed that the land should be laid out in lots for each house by itself, but the other proprietor interfered after that was done, because, in doing so they came to occupy some of his land. The houses were mixed in amongst the others, and before the land could be laid out it interfered with the other property, and he interdicted the proceedings.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",74
"75","19244. Do the properties lie adjacent to one another?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",75
"76","—They are mixed.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",76
"77","19245. In fact, the arrangement could hardly be carried out without what is called an excambion or interchange of properties to consolidate the properties, and then make an arrangement to consolidate the crofts?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",77
"78","—That is right.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",78
"79","19246. Do you know if the factor has ever represented the desirability of carrying out some arrangement?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",79
"80","—Yes.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",80
"81","19247. Could they not agree as to the terms?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",81
"82","—It appears so.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",82
"83","19248. And the tenants are the sufferers by it?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",83
"84","—Yes.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",84
"85","19249. Do you know how the properties came to be so mixed up?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",85
"86","—Partly because the late Mr Robertson purchased some property which belonged to the Earl of Zetland and other parties, and after his death his property was in the middle of the other property, and it was heired separately.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",86
"87","19250. It is a very complicated arrangement?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",87
"88","—Yes, and we have to suffer.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",88
"89","19251. Has the factor never suggested any way out of the difficulty?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",89
"90","—Yes, he has tried what he could; but it never came to any arrangement.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",90
"91","19252. Does the land you occupy belong to the one proprietor or to two?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",91
"92","—The land I am occupying belongs to one.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",92
"93","19253. And is it not all together?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",93
"94","—Not all together. I have about thirty patches of it.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",94
"95","19254. Separated from each other?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",95
"96","—Yes; I am not sure of thirty, but there are twenty at any rate.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",96
"97","19255. How do you get across to the other parts—do the people give free access?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",97
"98","—It is a difficult matter, but we must give each other access.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",98
"99","19256. Do you drive carts across the other man's arable ground?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",99
"100","—Not carts, but wheelbarrows.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",100
"101","19257. And you have to walk yourselves?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",101
"102","—Certainly. We have got a promise that it is to be arranged better in future; but we have had that promise for the last three years, and it has never taken place; and we have very bad houses as well.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",102
"103","19258. Sheriff Nicolson",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",103
"104","—You are all fishermen in West Sandwick, I suppose?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",104
"105","—Yes, mostly.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",105
"106","19259. How many men have a boat?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",106
"107","—Six, and sometimes five.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",107
"108","19260. Are any of them owners of boats?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",108
"109","—There is only one crew purchasing a boat just now.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",109
"110","19261. What is the cost of a boat with all its sails?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",110
"111","—One of these big boats costs from £240 to £250 new.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",111
"112","19262. And what will the nets cost besides ?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",112
"113","—Each net will cost about £3.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",113
"114","19263. How many nets will there be?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",114
"115","—According to the size of the boat—some forty and some fifty.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",115
"116","19264. What kind of boats are they—the same as those in Lerwick?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",116
"117","—Yes; some smack rigged and some lug sail boats.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",117
"118","19265. What is the average tonnage?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",118
"119","—25 to 30 tons of dead weight.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",119
"120","19266. Do you pursue the cod and ling fishing?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",120
"121","—Not this season; but I have done it in former years.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",121
"122","19267. Why not this season?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",122
"123","—Because the herring fishing commenced earlier.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",123
"124","19268. Have you had good herring fishing?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",124
"125","—Fairly, as yet.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",125
"126","19269. How long does it last?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",126
"127","—Up till about the latter part of September.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",127
"128","19270. What do you consider a good fishing for a boat to make?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",128
"129","—400 crans would be a fair fishing, and a good one 500 to 600 crans.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",129
"130","19271. Is there any fish-curing place at Sand wick?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",130
"131","—Yes, for ling and cod—a small place.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",131
"132","19272. Is it a good harbour?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",132
"133","—A fine harbour, only it is small. Heavy vessels could not very well come into it.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",133
"134","19273. Have you sufficient accommodation for your present boats?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",134
"135","—Yes.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",135
"136","19274. A good pier?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",136
"137","—Well, the pier is very simple just now; we can get into the pier at high water, but only then. It would be easy to have a pier there, and it would not be costly.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",137
"138","19275. A pier of stone and wood?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",138
"139","—Yes; the piers here are always made of stone and wood.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",139
"140","19276. Have you a sufficient supply of sea-ware for manure?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",140
"141","—Some seasons we get a good deal and some seasons none.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",141
"142","19277. Have you none except the drift sea-weed?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",142
"143","—None.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",143
"144","19278. None growing on the shores?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",144
"145","—A few houses have the benefit of a little, but only a few.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",145
"146","19279. What do you do for manure?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",146
"147","—We get turf.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",147
"148","19280. Is not that forbidden; is it not considered bad for the ground?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",148
"149","—No, not at all, where the ground is deep.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",149
"150","19281. Does the grass grow freely again?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",150
"151","—I lay down the surface, and take from underneath that",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",151
"152","19282. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",152
"153","—How many crofters besides yourself are concerned in getting matters adjusted betwixt the two proprietors?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",153
"154","—I could not exactly say. I suppose there are about fourteen or fifteen situated in the same way.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",154
"155","19283. What is the relationship between the two proprietors?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",155
"156","—The late proprietor who died was the half brother, I think, of the mother of the present proprietor.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",156
"157","19284. But they are relations?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",157
"158","—Yes, very distant relations.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",158
"159","19285. Did you and other people join in the remonstrance to have the matter settled?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",159
"160","—Yes, several of us tried.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",160
"161","19286. Did the whole of you join and sign a paper?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",161
"162","—Yes.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",162
"163","19287. And that was of no use?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",163
"164","—We got a promise that it was to be done, and in fact, it was done; but we never got the benefit. It was marked off how it was to be done.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",164
"165","19288. But have you remonstrated as a body, against the delay in carrying the thing out?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",165
"166","—No; we did once, at the commencement. ",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",166
"167","19289. Don't you think it would be wise to meet and put in another remonstrance against delay ?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",167
"168","—We have given notice through Mr Keith, the factor, and he has applied for us.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",168
"169","19290. Do you know whether one of the proprietors has only recently come of age, and that that is the reason he could not settle the matter legally?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",169
"170","—He is not of age yet, and won't be for some years.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",170
"171","—[A Voice.—The main cause is that it is in the hands of the lawyers.]",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",171
"172","—[Witness]. And the poor tenants suffer for it. The houses are most miserable too.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",172
"173","19291. The Chairman.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",173
"174","—Are there any of these houses in which the family and cattle are together?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",174
"175","—No, the cattle are by themselves.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",175
"176","19292. When you enter the house, do you enter by an independent door, or by the byre?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",176
"177","—By an independent door outside.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",177
"178","19293. Have you ever seen any houses in this country where the cattle and the family are under the same roof?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",178
"179","—Yes, I have heard of it, but I have never seen it.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",179
"180","19294. In this house of which you speak, are there any windows in the wall or only panes of glass?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",180
"181","—No, we have two small windows in the walls; but there is a portion of the present house which was handed down to me as being 140 years old, and nothing has been done to it since.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",181
"182","19295. Have your family been so long there?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",182
"183","—No, I have only been three years in my present house.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",183
"184","19296. But were your forefathers there?",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",184
"185","—They resided there, not in the present houses, but close by.",345,"Basil Sinclair","Mid Yell, Raefirth",185
