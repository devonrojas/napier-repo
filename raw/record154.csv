"1","JOHN MUNRO, Missionary, West Coast Mission (68)—examined.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",1
"2","8116. The Chairman.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",2
"3","—Is your mission connected with the Free Church?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",3
"4","—It is unsectarian.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",4
"5","8117. Are you a native of this part of the country?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",5
"6","—A native of Skye.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",6
"7","8118. What has your employment been during your life?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",7
"8","—I was for thirty-two years in Glasgow. It is six years since I came to Raasay. I was working at different employments in Glasgow.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",8
"9","8119. Were you employed in connection with persons of your own country—with Highlanders? ",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",9
"10","— A great deal.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",10
"11","8120. So if you were a long time in Glasgow, you had experience of your own countrymen?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",11
"12","—Very much. I held a piece of land before I went to Glasgow, in the parish of Snizort.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",12
"13","8121. Were you a teacher in Glasgow?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",13
"14","—No.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",14
"15","8122. Were you engaged in any trade, or always connected with religion!",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",15
"16","—Not entirely. I was for some time an agent selling fish, eggs, and all these things, that were sent from the Highlands to Glasgow.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",16
"17","8123. You have heard today, in the course of their examination, the people express a great reluctance in regard to emigration?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",17
"18","—I did.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",18
"19","8124. We know there have been times when the people in Skye and elsewhere were willing to go away, and we know there are many parts of Scotland from which the people desire to emigrate, and do emigrate with advantage. To what do you attribute this great reluctance the people express here?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",19
"20","—There may be several causes, but I find in many instances that they are inclined to remain in the country of their birth. I find that, I believe it is natural to the brute beast.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",20
"21","8125. Shall we say, natural to man?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",21
"22","—Natural to man, but I won't say that is in all cases a reason for a man to stay where he cannot  support himself.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",22
"23","8126. Do you think that if there was some encouragement given to the people to get better holdings here, and to make their life easier, that would incline others to emigrate? Is it a sort of stubbornness and discontent that makes them refuse to entertain the idea of emigrating?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",23
"24","—I don't believe that that is the case with many of them. At least, in this place where I am at present, they have this disadvantage, they have had no education, and uneducated people never read nor learn for themselves the advantages that might accrue from emigrating.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",24
"25","8127. But don't they sometimes hear? Don't they have letters from relatives in the colonies, or letters from other Scotsmen who have gone there?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",25
"26","—In many cases they are not very encouraging. I have had two brothers in Australia. One of them wrote me three or four times, and the other never wrote me. The first one went when I was in Glasgow. He reared a family of nine. He is now dead and gone; and I believe he was a very industrious good man when he lived, and he died by an accident, and his family are left quite poor. The other one is going about working the best way he can, but he never got a right settlement. Well, these brothers never could send me very encouraging letters to induce me to go. Others may be quite the same, though I have known many who have made what people term a fortune. I have known them.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",26
"27","8128. They generally acquire land of their own?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",27
"28","—Generally. Well, in that case I don't wonder so much that poor people, and especially, as I have said, uneducated people, don't see the general run of things in the colonies.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",28
"29","8129. They all express a desire to have more land in a better position in this island. Do you think that, if the proprietor was inclined to make some new crofter settlements upon his sheep farms, of the proper size, the people would go there and build their houses, and be capable of stocking the crofts, and living better than they do now, and pay rent? ",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",29
"30","—I don't believe there are any in Rona at present —at least, I don't know any—there may be one who would be able to stock a farm which would be likely to support a family. They are reduced into  poverty, and I don't wonder at it. Since I came to Rona I never saw a place like it. They toil away all spring —men, women, and children—and sometimes I am grieved to see the women, and perhaps I should not speak about some things I took notice of here in public. It might be very unsatisfactory to some minds to see in the public prints that a woman carrying sea-ware might be working at that to-day, and in child-bed to-morrow.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",30
"31","8130. Do you think that the women suffer in their health, and contract maladies in consequence of their severe physical labour?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",31
"32","—I have no doubt of it. I have no doubt in some cases they do.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",32
"33","8131. Lose their health altogether?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",33
"34","—Lose their health, with the disadvantage (as was brought out to-day) of the doctor being so far away. I have noticed several things in connection with that which were very disagreeable. I believe in Rona even, though the people there would get the whole of Rona gratis, they could not support their families. They would be almost as bad as they are.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",34
"35","8132. If you say the people of Rona cannot make a living in that island, and if you say they are not capable of stocking a croft on the mainland, and if you say they will not emigrate, what can they do?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",35
"36","—I don't know, unless Government looks after them. They have been reduced to poverty by the laws that made the people so long grind them down, and I think the Government should help them out of their difficulties, and they would work like other men. They are willing to work, and if they got the chance, I think they would do it. The people are a good people, willing to pay everybody their own.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",36
"37","8133. If every one of them had a good croft, and got a stock put on that croft for them, would they certainly pay the interest of that money? Have you any knowledge that in any country even the most benevolent Government has ever advanced money to purchase live stock for the people?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",37
"38","—I am not aware. I know some proprietors in Skye have advanced money on stock, and they did well.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",38
"39","8134. But you are speaking of the Government?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",39
"40","—I am not aware what Government did. I don't know what they did with the Irish people last year",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",40
"41","—whether they gave them money in advance or not —but I think they did.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",41
"42","8135. They have given them money to pay arrears of rent, but I don't know that they have ever given money for the purchase of live stock?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",42
"43","—Perhaps not.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",43
"44","8136. Have you anything else to state in the way of suggestion besides help from Government and the proprietor to stock the lands?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",44
"45","—I have no suggestion to make but what has been already stated, that there are too many people in Rona, and the land is poor, and they say themselves that it is dear. ",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",45
"46","8137. If the proprietor was, for instance, to give them land—new crofts—at what we call an improving rent —at a very small rent at first, increasing gradually—do you think the people would be able gradually to acquire stock?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",46
"47","—I believe that would be a very good plan.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",47
"48","8138. Is there any doctor in Raasay?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",48
"49","—No.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",49
"50","8139. Have you ever heard it was the intention of the proprietor to settle a doctor here for the benefit of the islands? ",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",50
"51","— He has been doing a great deal in that way. He has been keeping doctors in the mansionhouse, for years, and these doctors were very useful to the Rona and Raasay people.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",51
"52","8140. Did you hear them say there might be a bridge between Raasay and Fladda?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",52
"53","—Yes.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",53
"54","8141. Do you think that should be done?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",54
"55","—Oh, it could be done. It needs it very much. But there may be a difficulty in the case. There must be a passage left, for it is a channel for boats.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",55
"56","8142. But it is not necessary for ships with high masts?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",56
"57","—No, just small boats.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",57
"58","8143. Sheriff  Nicolson.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",58
"59","—You have been only six years here?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",59
"60","—Yes.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",60
"61","8144. Where were you before?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",61
"62","—I came from Glasgow.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",62
"63","8145. Then you have not much knowledge of the former state of the Rona people?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",63
"64","—No.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",64
"65","8146. You say they have been very ill-educated?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",65
"66","—Certainly.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",66
"67","8147. But they have had a school in Rona for a long time?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",67
"68","—-There was not a regular school at Rona; there was a schoolmaster coming now and again.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",68
"69","8148. Are there many of the adults that cannot read and write?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",69
"70","—A good many.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",70
"71","8149. I suppose none of them speak English except those who have been for some time in the south?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",71
"72","—Very few.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",72
"73","8150. Do you think they are desirous to get their children educated?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",73
"74","—Very much so.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",74
"75","8151. Do they speak of the school rates as being any grievous burden?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",75
"76","—No , I never heard. The only grievance is the want of roads from the south end to the schoolhouse.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",76
"77","8152. There is no road except a track among the rocks and bogs?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",77
"78","—No road.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",78
"79","8153. Are your avocations con6ned to Rona?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",79
"80","—And Kyle-Rona.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",80
"81","8154. I suppose the inhabitants are quiet, well-behaved people?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",81
"82","—A quiet, well-behaved people; very industrious.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",82
"83","8155. Is there a policeman at Raasay?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",83
"84","—None.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",84
"85","8156. And never was?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",85
"86","—Not that I know of.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",86
"87","8157. They have never had any occasion for one to come here?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",87
"88","—Well, there has never been any occasion for one since I came here at least.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",88
"89","8158. Has there been any crime of any seriousness?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",89
"90","—No, none.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",90
"91","8159. Neither in Raasay nor in Rona?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",91
"92","—Not that I am aware of, and now they have mostly given up strong drink, and that is a very great",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",92
"93","deal.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",93
"94","8160. Are they regular teetotalers, or have they just ceased from drink ?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",94
"95","—Some of them are, but most of them gave up drink voluntarily.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",95
"96","8161. They used to smuggle in this quarter?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",96
"97","—So I believe.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",97
"98","8162. They had great conveniences in the way of caves?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",98
"99","—They were showing me some of their stills.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",99
"100","8163. After your long residence in Glasgow, and coming back to Snizort, and Skye generally, did you find much change in the state of things and life and manners of the people?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",100
"101","—Not much.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",101
"102","8164. Did you think they were better or worse?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",102
"103","—In one respect their condition was worse, especially with respect to their poverty.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",103
"104","8165. There is some improvement in their houses?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",104
"105","—In Rona there is a very great improvement.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",105
"106","8166. I suppose they are very attentive to religious duties? ",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",106
"107","—Very attentive indeed.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",107
"108","8167. We have heard, in one or two other places, something as to the entire cessation from the ancient custom they had of singing songs and playing pipes. Do you know anything about the present as  compared with the past in the island?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",108
"109","—There is far less of that than has been.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",109
"110","8168. I suppose they very seldom have any singing of songs'?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",110
"111","—Very seldom indeed.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",111
"112","8169. They used to meet in the evenings, what was called a ceilidh, and tell stories and sing songs?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",112
"113","—I recollect that.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",113
"114","8170. Was it not a pleasant way of spending the evening?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",114
"115","—It was pleasant to those who liked it, but there was a great deal of nonsense.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",115
"116","8171. But that is very much given up?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",116
"117","—Very much given up.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",117
"118","8172. Then piping also has been very much given up in this quarter as elsewhere?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",118
"119","—Oh, yes. We seldom hear a pipe at all.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",119
"120","8173. Is there a piper in Raasay?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",120
"121","—There may be, but I do not know any.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",121
"122","8174. People allege that the Free Church ministers have exercised a depressing influence upon the people in that respect. Is there any truth in it?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",122
"123","—Perhaps there may be. It was leading to folly.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",123
"124","8175. Do you think the food of the people is worse than it used to be?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",124
"125","—I cannot say that. I cannot say it is. I know this, that they have less milk than they used to have, and we feel that loss.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",125
"126","8176. Have you sometimes difficulty in getting milk?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",126
"127","—Very much. In other respects the people are poor, and have vast difficulty in getting meal for their families. Still they live on meal mostly —at least, this whole year we have had so few potatoes, that I have heard some of them stating that they just had meal and fish. Now that is not so wholesome as potatoes and fish.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",127
"128","8177. How have they been off for herrings this winter?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",128
"129","—The herrings were very scarce.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",129
"130","8178. I suppose they would not think themselves badly off if they had porridge and milk for breakfast and potatoes and herring for dinner?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",130
"131","—They would not; but, as I say, potatoes are scarce, and there is very little milk to get.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",131
"132","8179. As to their clothes, do you think their clothing is better or worse than it used to be?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",132
"133","—It is not better in one respect. The Rona and Raasay people, when I recollect them first, used to be clothed all in homemade clothing, but now you seldom see any with home-made clothing. The home-made clothing was substantial.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",133
"134","8180. They made their own blankets in those days?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",134
"135","—They did, and I believe some of them do yet —most of them.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",135
"136","8181. Are there any native weavers in Rona and Raasay?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",136
"137","—There are. I think there is one in Rona.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",137
"138","8182. A woman, I suppose?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",138
"139","—Yes.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",139
"140","8183. Does she get regular employment?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",140
"141","—Well, she would get more than she was able to do. She was not constant at it, not being very healthy.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",141
"142","8184. As to their shoes, are they better shod or worse than they used to be?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",142
"143","—They are just much about it.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",143
"144","8185. Do any of them make their own shoes, as they did formerly?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",144
"145","—None. ",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",145
"146","8186. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",146
"147","—You said, in answer to Lord Napier, very few, perhaps only one, of the people of Rona, could stock the new lands that were proposed, without assistance. Suppose they got help from friends or outsiders, and if they knew they would not be disturbed in their new holdings, would they soon put themselves in a good position?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",147
"148","—-I am perfectly sure that they would.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",148
"149","8187. Now, they may not have much capital; but if I look around this room, I see a great number of strong men, and are not their hands a great deal of capital? ",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",149
"150","— A very great deal, if they just got proper encouragement and employment.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",150
"151","8188. Do you suppose, now, that some of those men going and reoccupying some of the crofts which Rainy cleared, would have to labour a bit harder than if they went to Australia or Canada?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",151
"152","—I believe they would labour harder.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",152
"153","8189. I mean, would it be necessary for them to labour harder than if they went abroad?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",153
"154","—It might, and I believe they would be more willing to do it.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",154
"155","8190. I don't think you take up my question. My question is, would it be necessary for these men to work harder on these lands here than it would be necessary to do if they went abroad?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",155
"156","—I do not see it would. There would not be any necessity for working harder, and I believe they would work willingly here. I have known several people who went to New Zealand and Australia. One that had been with me in Glasgow went there, and he was complaining very much of the hard labour he had to undergo abroad. Now, I do not see that they would have to labour anything harder here than they would in Australia or New Zealand.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",156
"157","8191. From the great anxiety you have seen displayed this day by the delegates and others about being sent to those places, don't you think that that would nerve and encourage them to work even more than might be necessary, for the purpose of repaying any advances that might be made to them at the outset?",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",157
"158","—I believe it would nerve them.",154,"John Munro","Raasay, Torran",158
