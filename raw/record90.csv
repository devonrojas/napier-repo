"1","MALCOLM M'INNES, Crofter and Fisherman, Heaste (35)—examined. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",1
"2","4899. The Chairman.",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected to be a delegate?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",3
"4","—Yes. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",4
"5","4900. Have you any statement to make on the part of those who have elected you ?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",5
"6","—Yes; the lots which we have are too small, and we have spoiled them owing to the frequency of our cultivation of them. I myself remember getting crops very much better than we can get to-day out of them, and the reason for that is that our holdings are so small (see Appendix A. XIII) that we leave to cultivate them entirely every year, and if we don't do that the crop will not feed our summing of stock, and even after all the crop is not sufficient for that purpose. We are out of pocket £6 or £7 for feeding for our stock in addition to what the lot grows. Besides that, none of us can get as much seed from our corn as will sow our land. We had no potatoes at all last year. We had to buy them all. We had to buy seed oats last year also. Other years we might not be as ill off as that. Again, we are at the back of the country, and we have no roadway. We are four miles from this place, and this is the nearest place from which we can get our supplies. This is the nearest place at which steamers call. Drainage money was laid upon us—I don't remember how far back. Those drains then burst, and I had then to lift them and relay them, or the ground would be worthless. But I got no compensation for that, and I myself am paying the drainage interest which was originally laid upon me. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",6
"7","4901. The Chairman.",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",7
"8","—How many years is it since the drainage was effected ?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",8
"9","—Before my time. I believe it was thirty-five years ago. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",9
"10","4902. Was the ground benefited by the trenches?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",10
"11","—Yes, at first; but then they burst, and they were useless until I re-opened them. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",11
"12","4903. You did re-open them. Is the ground still the better for the trenching executed at that time?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",12
"13","—Yes, it is the better for it to the present day, as long as the outflow is kept clear. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",13
"14","4904. What do you desire in order to improve your condition ?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",14
"15","—Though the land is dear, we have to complain we have not got enough of it. We have to keep a pair of horses, and we have not got enough work for our horses to do on these lots, and we have to keep them all the same. We cannot work a cart or any other wheeled conveyance until we get a roadway. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",15
"16","4905. Have you any hill pasture ?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",16
"17","—Yes. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",17
"18","4906. How many crofters are there ?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",18
"19","—Thirteen crofts. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",19
"20","4907. What is the summing?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",20
"21","—Five cows, twenty-four sheep, and a pair of horses. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",21
"22","4908. How much is the rent?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",22
"23","—£10, 16s. besides rates. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",23
"24","4909. Do you consider that too high a rent?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",24
"25","—Yes, because of the badness of the soil, owing to the frequency of its cultivation. I have no doubt the land at first would yield sufficient to feed the stock. We have to buy all the meal that our families require.(see Appendix A. XIII) ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",25
"26","4910. Do you make no meal for your family off your croft at all ?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",26
"27","—No, we cannot even get as much seed oats as will sow our land. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",27
"28","4911. What is the extent of the arable ground?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",28
"29","—I believe six acres. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",29
"30","4912. Professor Mackinnon.",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",30
"31","—I suppose you heard the evidence that was given by the smaller crofters here during the whole of the day?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",31
"32","—Yes. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",32
"33","4913. Their idea was that a croft of this size would be about a reasonable-sized croft. Don't you think you could manage to let a part of your six acres rest every year, and cultivate the rest, and that that would be a better way, leaving out, say, two acres every year?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",33
"34","—We would have nothing then to feed our stock with. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",34
"35","4914. Could you not keep more sheep then, and one horse ?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",35
"36","—The cows are better for the ground than sheep. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",36
"37","4915. What would you consider a reasonable-sized croft?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",37
"38","—We would require double as much as we have to keep our pair of horses in work. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",38
"39","4916. That would be twelve acres ?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",39
"40","—Yes. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",40
"41","4917. Ten cows ?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",41
"42","—Yes. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",42
"43","4918. Forty-eight sheep ?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",43
"44","—Yes. ",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",44
"45","4919. Do you think that croft would be worth twice the rent you pay just now?",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",45
"46","—I would prefer to give double the rent for such a croft than to be dealing with such a croft as I have, for I could then leave out a part of it. We have to complain also of the deer.",90,"Malcolm Mcinnes","Skye, Broadford",46
