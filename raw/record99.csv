"1","ALLAN CAMPBELL, Crofter and Labourer, Teangue (55)—examined.",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",1
"2","5207. The Chairman.",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected by the people of Teangue ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",3
"4","—Yes. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",4
"5","5208. Were there a number of the people present ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",5
"6","—All but two. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",6
"7","5209. The statement submitted for the people of Teangue is as follows:",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",7
"8","—' The case of Teangue was first taken up, and the people present from that township were asked to state their opinions as to their circumstances generally. The great complaint seems to be the smallness of their holdings, one man stating that he remembers when eight families resided on the same ground where there are now seventeen. That the gross rent, moreover, is now considerably more than it was when the families held it. That would be about thirty years ago. At present only two tenants hold entire lots, and these two only have the full complement of stock, the others having less, and some one cow, and others none at all About twelve years ago an increase of rent of lis. on some of the lots was  imposed. On one particular lot there were no fewer than four tenants and one cottar. It will be apparent, from these facts, that, as is actually the case, the men have to seek employment in the south and elsewhere. It was proposed and agreed to that Mr Allan Campbell and Alexander Buchanan be appointed delegates from Teangue.' ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",8
"9","Have you any statement to make on behalf of the people of Teangue in addition to this ? ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",9
"10","—Only the poverty of the people and the scantiness of their land. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",10
"11","5210. Professor Mackinnon.",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",11
"12","—Are you able to state what is the amount of stock held upon a lot I",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",12
"13","—Six cows and a horse was what was in use to be the case. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",13
"14","5211. And sheep?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",14
"15","—Eight sheep. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",15
"16","5212. And there are only two men who hold a single lot and these are the only two who have the proper stock I",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",16
"17","—Yes. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",17
"18","5213. Is the croft quite able to support that amount of stock ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",18
"19","—No. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",19
"20","5214. How much stock could they keep?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",20

"22","5215. You have no horse ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",22
"23","—Yes, a horse and four sheep. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",23

"27","5217. Professor Mackinnon.",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",27
"28","—How much could the whole croft keep well I",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",28
"29","—It would be enough to do to feed four cows and a horse and eight sheep. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",29
"30","5218. What is the rent of the full croft ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",30
"31","—-The rents vary. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",31
"32","5219. There are only two full crofts altogether. What are the rents of these two?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",32
"33","—-£7, 10s. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",33
"34","5220. Without taxes ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",34

"36","5221. Do you consider that croft reasonably big enough?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",36
"37","—It is small enough. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",37
"38","5222. There are seventeen families, but there are only eight lots. If you were to remove the other nine, how would you propose to deal with them ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",38
"39","—Give them land somewhere else. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",39
"40","5223. Where is there such land to suit them?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",40

"42","5224. Is there land in this parish and on this estate ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",42

"44","5225. Where?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",44
"45","—All up and down about here. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",45
"46","5226. Would you name the farms?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",46
"47","—Knock, Ord, Armadale, Ostaig, Tormore, Gillen; plenty land there under big sheep. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",47
"48","5227. Who occupies Knock?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",48
"49","—Mr Kennedy. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",49
"50","5228. If that place were to let, would the people be willing to take it ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",50
"51","—They would take a share of it. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",51
"52","5229. Would they be prepared to pay a reasonable rent for it?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",52
"53","—If they would get it in a way they could live on it. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",53
"54","5230. Would they be able to stock it?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",54
"55","—If they would get enough land that they would take their living out of it, they could stock it in time. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",55
"56","5231. It is stated here that there are some of them that have not stockfor the small places they have?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",56
"57","—They cannot feed them.",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",57
"58","5232. That is the reason. It is not because they cannot buy the stock, but because the place cannot keep the stock ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",58
"59","—Yes, the place is so small when there are four families on a lot that they cannot keep stock.",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",59
"60","5233. But you think if they got a larger place they would be able to put stock upon it ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",60
"61","—Yes, if they would get it at a reasonable rent. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",61
"62","5234. And they would be quite able to pay a reasonable rent for it1?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",62
"63","— Yes. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",63
"64","5235. What do you mean by a reasonable rent ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",64
"65","—Rent that we could pay, and for land out of which we could extract a living. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",65
"66","5236. Your complaint is rather that the crofts are too small, not that the present rents are too high ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",66
"67","—We have not much to say about the rent. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",67
"68","5237. It seems reasonable ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",68
"69","—It seems reasonable, if the ground were in the way we could make a living out of it. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",69
"70","5238. Mr Fraser-Macintosh.",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",70
"71","—Are you well acquainted with this parish of Sleat ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",71

"73","5239. Are you aware that a great deal of land that was once occupied by crofters is now in possession of tacksmen ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",73
"74","—Yes. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",74
"75","5240. Supposing that all the crofters in Sleat were to receive the enlarged crofts you desiderate, would there be- still sufficient land remaining for a good-sized tack ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",75
"76","—I think so. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",76
"77","5241. Can you mention the number of large tacksmen there are in Sleat ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",77
"78","—Yes: Mr Macdonald, Ord; Mr Macdonald, Tormore,—he has Ostaig; Duncan M'Innes, Gillen; Mr Kennedy, Knock. Ferrindonald I may include in the number of tacks; it is in the hands of Mr Macpherson. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",78
"79","5242. Are these all the big tacks? There is Kinloch ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",79
"80","—Kinloch is not in this parish. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",80
"81","5243. You have mentioned a Mr Kennedy as a tenant of Kinloch. Is he the man who keeps the shop here ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",81
"82","—Yes. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",82
"83","5244. Have you any complaint to make, or is there any dissatisfaction in the country about there being no other place where you could get articles to buy except at this one shop ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",83
"84","—It is the only shop in the district. Doubtless, if there were four or five or six other shops in the district, it would be easier for people to get goods, and cheaper. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",84
"85","5245. Can you read writing ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",85
"86","—No. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",86

"89","5247. Did you ever see or hear of a written document connected with a penalty for going to provision shops, which was put up at the inn here ? ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",89
"90","—No, I did not hear. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",90
"91","5248. Or any other place ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",91
"92","—No, it might be without my knowing it; should I see it, I could not read it. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",92
"93","5249. Did you hear of such a thing?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",93
"94","—No, I never heard anything about it. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",94
"95","5250. Mr Cameron.",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",95
"96","—How did the seventeen families get on to the land where there were only nine crofts ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",96
"97","—There is one lot which is subdivided into four shares—these being subdivided to the sons of the family. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",97
"98","5251. Do you think, if the crofters got larger crofts upon these lands you have mentioned, their holdings would likely be subdivided in the course of years, as those places have been ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",98
"99","—Possibly they might come to be subdivided in time. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",99
"100","5252. Are the people very poor in your township ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",100
"101","—Yes, very poor. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",101

"104","5254. And some of them have not ?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",104
"105","—Some of them have not. Very few have money in the bank. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",105
"106","5255. How would they be able to purchase the stock to take these larger holdings?",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",106
"107","— Earning it by working for others. ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",107
"108","5256. But to make a start ",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",108
"109","—If we would get the land we would be trying to stock it.",99,"Allan Campbell","Skye, Isle Ornsay",109
