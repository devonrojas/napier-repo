"1","ALEXANDER WALKER, Merchant, Mid Yell (28)—examined.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",1
"2","19394. The Chairman.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",2
"3","—How long have you been settled here ",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",3
"4","—Nearly four years.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",4
"5","19395. Were you brought up to this description of trade?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",5
"6","—No.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",6
"7","19396. What was your father?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",7
"8","—My father was a gardener.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",8
"9","19397. You are a young man to have become a trader. Were you anywhere else before being here?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",9
"10","—South Shields.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",10
"11","19398. How did you come to establish yourself in Shetland?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",11
"12","—My wife is a Shetlander, and I came with her and her brother to Shetland, and we started business together in West Sandwick, and then removed from there to here, and dissolved partnership.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",12
"13","19399. You have been here only four years?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",13
"14","—Yes, since 1880.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",14
"15","19400. Since you have established yourself here, have you found your business improving?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",15
"16","—Yes, but there were a great many drawbacks that kept us back.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",16
"17","19401. Still you say there has been some improvement?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",17
"18","—Certainly.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",18
"19","19402. What do you deal in besides fish-curing?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",19
"20","—General goods of all kinds.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",20
"21","19403. Do you find that the people make more purchases than when you first came?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",21
"22","—-They do.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",22
"23","19404. Do they pay as well as they did?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",23
"24","—They pay better.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",24
"25","19405. They buy more and pay better'?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",25
"26","—They do.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",26
"27","19406. Do you think the condition of the people has improved within the last four years?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",27
"28","—It has.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",28
"29","19407. You said that there were drawbacks to the improvement of your trade; what are these drawbacks?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",29
"30","—Since I came to Shetland this is my second removal from a yearly tenancy. At Martinmas 1881, I",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",30
"31","was removed from this place, after offering £50 for the place. I paid £35 before. I was the sitting tenant, and I offered the same rent and the same security as the man who came after me, but I had to be removed.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",31
"32","19408. But still you continued in Mid Yell?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",32
"33","—I had to build a shop for myself, and lie out of business on account of these removals. It almost ruined me. I furnished the place. I had an hotel licence, and my furniture was lying in the manse after I was in the place a year.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",33
"34","19409. Why didn't you apply for a lease?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",34
"35","—I did that, but they would not give it.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",35
"36","19410. When you opened shop and established yourself, how did you get ground upon which to build your shop?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",36
"37","—I got it from Mr George Hay of Lerwick, a different proprietor.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",37
"38","19411. And have you a lease now?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",38
"39","—No, I was promised a lease once the shop was built, and the shop was built for a little more than £100, and he charged me £16 more than the place paid before, for the £100 of outlay.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",39
"40","19412. You have laid out this money without a lease?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",40
"41","—They built the shop; I paid for the building, but they afterwards paid me.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",41
"42","19413. Did they pay you back in full?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",42
"43","—In full.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",43
"44","19414. Then you now sit as tenant at will?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",44
"45","—Tenant at will, and six-monthly rent.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",45
"46","19415. What is their great objection to giving a lease?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",46
"47","—I cannot tell. I was certainly promised a lease from Mr Hay, but he has not fulfilled that promise, and there are a great many drawbacks. I have no pier, and I am agent for the Earl of Zetland and for the Steam Navigation Co. I have to wade into the sea in carrying out my duties as agent for the steamer, while, if I had had a lease, I would have improved the place, and built a pier for myself. But how could I do so, and be turned out perhaps at the end of the year.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",47
"48","19416. What other drawbacks are there?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",48
"49","—The drawback is this, that if we do improve, we have no certainty of getting anything for improving; and we are tenants at will which is a very wrong thing. In addition, last year I had £700 worth of goods, and what was I to do with forty days’ notice in a place like Shetland? I have three fishing boats and men to supply, and it won't do for me to be without stock, especially here where we only get the steamer once a week.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",49
"50","19417. Have you the facilities of postal communication and telegraph?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",50
"51","—We have; but we have not got accommodation where we can telegraph for an article and have it in the shop by the next train. Perhaps the steamer leaving Lerwick may miss the south steamer's goods, and in that way one may miss his stuff. I cannot get goods the same as in the north of Scotland or England. The summer before last we had only two posts in the week, and in winter only one. I think in summer now there are three.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",51
"52","19418. Sheriff Nicolson.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",52
"53","—Do you deal largely with the people hereabout?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",53
"54","—I do.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",54
"55","19419. Do you find them good customers ?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",55
"56","—I do.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",56
"57","19420. Are they generally able to pay fairly well?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",57
"58","—Yes, if we keep away from the poorer classes; plenty of them are not able to earn anything.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",58
"59","19421. Are there many of them not able to earn anything?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",59
"60","—There are a great many feeble old people.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",60
"61","19422. Do you give them long credit?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",61
"62","—Commonly we have to give it from year to year; we cannot help it, although it is safe enough. Crofters are not like people getting in money every day. They cannot sell stock more than once a year. They cannot get money unless they sell stock, and if you push them for money they have to sell their stock at a disadvantage perhaps.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",62
"63","19423. What sort of goods do you chiefly sell to them?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",63
"64","—General goods and drapery and groceries, and I buy hosiery.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",64
"65","19424. Do you sell meal ?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",65
"66","—Meal and all.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",66
"67","19425. Do you take fish from them?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",67
"68","—Yes.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",68
"69","19426. What is the system on which you take the fish,—do you pay money or goods?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",69
"70","—Those who require money are paid in money; some require goods, and some will take part goods and part money. That is the way commonly; but mostly now it is cash.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",70
"71","19427. Has there been any change in that respect within the last few years?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",71
"72","—No material change since I came here.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",72
"73","19428. Didn't there use to be more of a system of paying by goods?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",73
"74","—I believe so; but that was before my time.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",74
"75","19429. Do the people here know when the fish is taken from them what the price is to be?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",75
"76","—Yes, the price is the first thing asked for.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",76
"77","19430. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",77
"78","—You have been here most of the day?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",78
"79","—I have.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",79
"80","19431. You have heard the evidence given by the other -witnesses?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",80
"81","—Yes.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",81
"82","19432. Do you agree with them, from your own observation and your conversation with the people about their complaints, that no encouragement is given by the proprietors in the neighbourhood, and that very little progress is going on?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",82
"83","—I believe that is so. There is little encouragement given by the proprietors.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",83
"84","19433. And consequently there is not the progress there might be?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",84
"85","—Not half.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",85
"86","19434. You were paying when you came here first £35, 0s. 5d. of rent ?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",86
"87","—Yes.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",87
"88","19435. And you were willing to give £50?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",88
"89","—I offered £50 when the place was advertised.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",89
"90","19436. What additional accommodation or buildings were given by the proprietor or included in that enlarged rent?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",90
"91","—None given, but a great deal taken away. I had a farm here, and it was taken from the property altogether.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",91
"92","19437. And there was a rise of rent?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",92
"93","—Yes, and a reduction of the farm.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",93
"94","19438. Do you consider, therefore, that these proceedings have had the effect of harassing you in business?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",94
"95","—I am all but alive. It has almost been my death, and nearly ruined me besides. There were six months I lay in a small place of 12 or 11 feet long and 12 feet wide, by being thrown out, and having no place to go to with my wife and children. And we had to take in £600 worth of shop goods with us.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",95
"96","19439. When you came here from Sandwick did you come with the purpose of developing the resources of the place, and do good to yourself?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",96
"97","—I did.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",97
"98","19440. Is there only one proprietor all along here? ",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",98
"99","—Yes, the whole way, unless the small piece of property I am on, belonging to Mr Hay.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",99
"100","19441. What is the name of the proprietor, and the person upon whose land you were formerly?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",100
"101","—It belonged to the Spences—Mr Robert Niven Spence; but he died before I came here. It was sold then to Richmond & Co., or Mr John Harrison, the present proprietor.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",101
"102","19442. Who occupies the store and place you had formerly?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",102
"103","—Mr Alexander Sandison.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",103
"104","19143. Does he live there?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",104
"105","—He does.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",105
"106","19144. l)ocs he carry on the same occupation as yourself?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",106
"107","—Not exactly; he is not interested in fishing personally. Perhaps he is interested for the proprietor for all I know.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",107
"108","19445. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",108
"109","—Has he a business?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",109
"110","—Yes, the same as I had.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",110
"111","19446. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",111
"112","—Is that the only licensed house here?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",112
"113","—It is.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",113
"114","19447. We were told that in other places that, when fishing population is about, the licence is suspended; why is that not done here?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",114
"115","—I don't know : I believe it would have been in our favour if it had.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",115
"116","19448. You personally would not be against it if you held the licence?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",116
"117","—I know for a fact it would keep many a shilling in my drawer which I have to pay out. I have sixteen or eighteen fishermen in my boats, and when they come ashore they want money to get drink, and let the fishing be good or bad I have to give it to them, and it comes to be a drain upon me.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",117
"118","19449. What rent are you now paying?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",118
"119","—£20, with taxes.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",119
"120","19450. Mr Cameron.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",120
"121","—The shilling would be carried to their credit?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",121
"122","—I pay it to them.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",122
"123","19451. You would have to pay it later on; but you are not a gainer?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",123
"124","—No, I am not a loser, if I am certain of it at the end of the season.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",124
"125","19452. You take the shilling into consideration when you settle with the fishermen?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",125
"126","—Yes.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",126
"127","19453. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",127
"128","—What have you for the £20?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",128
"129","—Not so much as I could stand upon outside my door. The house was formerly 4, and I was to have a lease; the rent was put down at £4 for the house and £16 for the shop. The cost of the shop was a little over £100.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",129
"130","19454. What do you pay for milk and supplies?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",130
"131","—I pay for grass, and keep one cow for the sake of my children only. Otherwise I would not keep a cow at all; I have no place for it.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",131
"132","19455. The Chairman.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",132
"133","—What do you pay for the grazing of the cow?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",133
"134","—Twenty shillings a year.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",134
"135","19456. What do you pay in winter?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",135
"136","—I have to purchase stuff.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",136
"137","19457. How much does it cost you?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",137
"138","—Perhaps about £2; I paid it last year.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",138
"139","19458. Does the cow run out in winter?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",139
"140","—I have the use of the hill during the whole year, but there is scarcely any grass in winter. The cow goes to get the air.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",140
"141","19459. The cow on the hill costs about £3 a year?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",141
"142","—It does.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",142
"143","19460. For which you get the milk?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",143
"144","—Yes.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",144
"145","19461. And that suits you better than to buy milk?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",145
"146","—I could not get it to buy.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",146
"147","19462. Sheriff Nicolson.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",147
"148","—Is milk so scarce?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",148
"149","—It is.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",149
"150","19463. Do the people need it all for their own families?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",150
"151","—-Yes, and more if they could get it. Sometimes they have no milk at all. There are some large families, and sometimes it is late before the cow calves.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",151
"152","19464. What do they give their children?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",152
"153","—They purchase syrup in spring; sometime in the spring of the year the cattle are not able to rise",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",153
"154","owing to want of food.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",154
"155","19465. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",155
"156","—Is it customary to go round the hill and lift them?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",156
"157","—No, they are in the byres.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",157
"158","19466. But they have to be lifted ?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",158
"159","—Yes, a thing which is unknown where I belong to, as the cattle are better fed. I belong to Deeside, ",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",159
"160","Aberdeenshire. ",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",160
"161","19467. Professor Mackinnon.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",161
"162","—How long had you a licence?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",162
"163","—Only one year.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",163
"164","19468. Was the licence suspended during the fishing season that year?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",164
"165","—No, but the fishing season then was not like what it is now. There was only one curer then, and latterly there have been two.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",165
"166","19469. By your arrangement with the fishermen, are you bound to supply them with money for drink?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",166
"167","—I am bound to a certain extent; if the men have been out at the ling fishing for two or three nights it is necessary that they should have something when they come in, and many a time at herring fishing the same thing occurs. But at the same time, I will not say that it is necessary just now, in the herring fishing season.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",167
"168","19470. Would it not be necessary to have a licence in that case?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",168
"169","—Not so much now as in the dead of winter.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",169
"170","19471. Are you bound to supply them with money to get drink?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",170
"171","—No.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",171
"172","19472. Why do you do it?-",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",172
"173","—For the convenience of the men.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",173
"174","19473. Do you consider it wrong?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",174
"175","—Many a time I do, but still I cannot help it.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",175
"176","19474. But your complaint against the proprietor is that he preferred to have another tenant?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",176
"177","—Yes, that is the late proprietor. He told me my offer would be as good as that of any one else, but I found it was not.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",177
"178","19475. He gave the place to the other tenant at the same rent as you offered?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",178
"179","—Yes, but the farm was taken away.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",179
"180","19476. You offered £50 for the place you had, including the farm?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",180
"181","—I t was put up that way, and I offered £50, as it was advertised.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",181
"182","19477. And the proprietor got £50 for the place, less the farm?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",182
"183","—Yes, but it was less the farm that I offered.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",183
"184","19478. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",184
"185","—Was the place advertised without their making you an offer?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",185
"186","—It was.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",186
"187","19479. Professor Mackinnon.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",187
"188","—And it was given to one who only made the same offer as you?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",188
"189","—Yes.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",189
"190","19480. The Chairman.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",190
"191","—And you were put to the expense and inconvenience of shifting the goods, and having no place to shift them to?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",191
"192","—Yes.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",192
"193","19481. Professor Mackinnon.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",193
"194","—What remedy would you provide for the like of that?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",194
"195","—To give a lease would be the best remedy, and then, when a man's lease expired, he would know it was his duty to renew it, or look out for some other place.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",195
"196","19482. Would you deprive the proprietor of the right to choose his tenant?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",196
"197","—No, but I think the sitting tenant, if his character is good, ought to have the preference.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",197
"198","19483. Would you make that a matter of law?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",198
"199","—I cannot say that; I think it ought to have been a matter of law in this case. Forty days' warning is not sufficient for a merchant in business.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",199
"200","19481. The Chairman.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",200
"201","—Would you make a proper length of warning a matter of law?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",201
"202","—Yes, I should say that in cases of yearly tenure one year's notice should be given.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",202
"203","19485. Mr Cameron.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",203
"204","—Would you apply that to all places in England and Scotland?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",204
"205","—No, but there I would have got a store for my goods.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",205
"206","19486. Would you make it the law elsewhere than in Mid Yell?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",206
"207","—I would make it a law in any country place, in the case of a tenant at will, especially in the case of a country merchant, when he is liable to be turned out at forty days' notice it is a very silly affair.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",207
"208","19487. Is he more silly in Mid Yell than he would be in London or Manchester?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",208
"209","—Yes, what would I do with my goods in Mid Yell?—I would have to charter a schooner to take my goods out of the country. There is no store to put one's goods into.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",209
"210","19488. Don't you think if business people had this enormous advantage under the law that there might be very considerable competition amongst them, and that they would come to Mid Yell?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",210
"211","—No, I don't think that. The best way to prevent that is to give leases.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",211
"212","19489. But there might be competition for the lease?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",212
"213","—Just so.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",213
"214","19490. Professor Mackinnon.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",214
"215","—Would you apply it to the merchant as well as the proprietor?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",215
"216","—I would have it fair on both sides.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",216
"217","19491. That the merchant should be bound to give notice too?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",217
"218","—Yes, I should say so. The present notice of forty days' is too short.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",218
"219","19492. And the merchant would be bound to give security for a year's advance of rent?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",219
"220","—That would be a simple matter.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",220
"221","19493. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",221
"222","—You applied for a lease at £35, 0s. 5d.?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",222
"223","—Yes.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",223
"224","19494. And you consider that the landlord, having refused to give you the lease, had no right then to put you out in favour of a stranger, you being willing to give the same increase of rent?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",224
"225","—That is so; I might even have given £10 or £20 more rather than be removed I would suggest in addition to what I have stated, that a workhouse should be erected in Lerwick or elsewhere. There are more paupers in the parish than ought to be getting a supply, and that is at our expense entirely; whereas in the workhouse, women who can do any kind of work, might bring in something which could be applied to the support of the institution.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",225
"226","19495. Are there poor here on the rolls who ought to be supported by their relatives?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",226
"227","—There are some, I think, but there are a great many on the poor roll who would be able to do something if they were energetic enough.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",227
"228","19496. And who would not go into the poorhouse?",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",228
"229","—I am certain they would not. One workhouse would be sufficient for the whole of the islands. Under the present system, there is also the expense of keeping inspectors, which would be avoided if a workhouse were erected. We don't have any satisfaction under the present system at all.",347,"Alexander Walker","Mid Yell, Raefirth",229
