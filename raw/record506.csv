"1","JOHN M'LENNAN, Crofter, Cuaig (63)—examined.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",1
"2","29911. The Chairman.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",2
"3","—Have you anything to say ?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",3
"4","—No.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",4
"5","29912. Why did you come here?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",5
"6","—To see what you were doing.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",6
"7","29913. Are you satisfied?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",7
"8","—Well, the deer come and eat our crops. It is a hard thing for a man of my age to watch out every second night to preserve my crops, and after all that the crops should be eaten up.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",8
"9","29911. Have you any one at home to assist you ?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",9
"10","—I have only two sons and they are at the east coast fishing to provide food for us.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",10
"11","29915. How many crofters are there in your place ?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",11
"12","—Eight.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",12
"13","29916. Do they all suffer from the deer?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",13
"14","—Yes, in the same way.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",14
"15","29917. Do you appoint a watcher at night amongst yourselves?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",15
"16","—Four every night.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",16
"17","29918. Does the proprietor pay them?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",17
"18","—We never asked him to pay.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",18
"19","29919. Does the proprietor ever help you or pay you any compensation for the damage done by the deer ?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",19
"20","—We never asked the proprietor anything.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",20
"21","29950. Is it true that the deer really do you much harm ?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",21
"22","—Of course, quite certainly; how can it be otherwise ? Although I could take my watch one night it would be very difficult for my wife, who might perhaps be nursing, to watch the next night. One might keep watch, but the other might not; and so the crops are lost.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",22
"23","29951. Have you asked the proprietor to put up a fence?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",23
"24","—Yes, we spoke to him about a fence, and he said if we would put the stone ourselves he would put the iron.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",24
"25","29952. What do you mean by putting the stone? How high would you have to build the stone dyke ?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",25
"26","—Three feet high, all the stone wall.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",26
"27","29953. And how long would it be ?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",27
"28","—Over a mile.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",28
"29","29954. Are there many stones about the ground ?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",29
"30","—In some places there are plenty stones along the course of the dyke; in others not.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",30
"31","29955. Would you not do well to take the proprietor's offer and help him to lay the stones down ?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",31
"32","—Perhaps it would; I believe we would be better off than we are if we did; I am certain of it. But we thought that the proprietor might perhaps help in building the stone wall if we gathered the stones.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",32
"33","29956. Would you gather the stones if the proprietor would employ skilled labour to build the dyke?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",33
"34","—I can only speak for myself; I would have been glad of that for many a long day; but the others are away at the east coast fishing and I cannot speak for them on that subject.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",34
"35","29957. Perhaps when they come back you will speak to them about that and make an offer to the proprietor?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",35
"36","—Perhaps so.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",36
"37","29958. How far are you from the place where the ironwork could be got. Could it be brought to your place by sea?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",37
"38","—Yes.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",38
"39","29959. Would you help to carry it up to the ground?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",39
"40","—Everything we could; we would give assistance in every shape.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",40
"41","29960. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",41
"42","—-How many heads of families did you say there are at Cuaig?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",42
"43","—There are eight lots and three families that live upon the township in addition.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",43
"44","29961. Are all these families except two, yourself and the other man, away earning wages ?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",44
"45","—Every one of them except myself and my neighbour here. There is just one other man, and he is too old to come here —he is lame.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",45
"46","29962. Your crofts even at the best do not support you, far less when you are troubled with the deer ?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",46
"47","—No, they would not support us although there were no deer ; we never look to that. They would help us; they would assist us; and they often assist us, although the deer are injuring us; but if fences were set up they would assist us very much.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",47
"48","29963. Were you deprived of anything when the forest was made a forest ?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",48
"49","—No, we have plenty of hill pasture. That is all our complaint.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",49
"50","29964. Are the deer increasing in number?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",50
"51","—Yes, in our place anyway.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",51
"52","29965. Is there any township within some miles of you ?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",52
"53","—Yes, and that township the crofters themselves fenced.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",53
"54","29966. How many miles is it from you ?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",54
"55","—About a mile, or a little more. There is another township, Fearnmore, where the deer never came.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",55
"56","29967. Are you aware that the forest has been let for some years past ?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",56
"57","—I cannot tell; I know nothing about it.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",57
"58","29968. Are you not aware that the proprietor himself has not been sporting for some years?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",58
"59","—I know the proprietor does not stop there; others do; I don't know whether it is a tenant or not.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",59
"60","29969. Although you might not wish to trouble your landlord at the same time, since the place is let to a tenant, why don't you come down upon the tenant for damage?",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",60
"61","—We did not know that we could do that, but evidently we know it now.",506,"John Mclennan","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",61
