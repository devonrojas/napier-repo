"1","NORMAN M'KENZIE, Crofter, Uigshader—examined. ",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",1
"2","1152. The Chairman.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",2
"3","—How long have you had your croft?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",3
"4","—I have not had a croft long, but it is thirteen years since my father got it.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",4
"5","1153. Is your father alive?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",5
"6","—He is not alive.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",6
"7","1154. Have you been a fisherman as well as a crofter?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",7
"8","—I have not been a fisherman. We are too far from the sea.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",8
"9","1155. Have you heard what has been stated by previous witnesses?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",9
"10","— Part of it.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",10
"11","1156. You understood what was said?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",11
"12","—Yes.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",12
"13","1157. Will you be so good as to add any remarks you wish to make?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",13
"14","—What I have to say is, that I do not think, should Lord Macdonald give them the whole land they have from him free gratis, it would not free them from their present state of poverty.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",14
"15","1158. What matter are you speaking of?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",15
"16","—I speak of the people of the district in which I reside. I mean the district comprising the seventeen families among whom I live; and the cause of that is this that the years have come to be so poor, and they have run out of their effects through having to buy food for themselves and their families and their stock. I believe that the people are seven times worse than if they had nothing— are empty—if every thing were put in its place. If the people paid their debts, they would be seven times worse than nothing. The people have come to be so poor that they are not able to work the land as it ought to be worked; and again they have so little of the land. We don't blame the landlord for their poverty, but there are no works going on in the place. They must needs go elsewhere to work, and they cannot attend to their crofts; and when they go elsewhere and are not able to attend properly to their crofts, they have to buy food for themselves and their stock elsewhere; and though they are trying to keep stock, not a head of the stock belongs to themselves, but to their creditors and to the landlord. When that is so, the people cannot but be poor. They are occupying land which has not been manured for twenty-five years, though they must needs cultivate this land for the very poor return of the little corn and weeds that it yields. They pay equal to their rent in money for the wintering of their stock besides what the land yields. When Mr Martin came to be our tacksman, we were paying the multures ; we were paying the equivalent in money, along with our rent, so much on each croft; and when we became tenants of Lord Macdonald, Tormore was the factor, and that payment continued, and it is included in the rent still,—these old multures,—and should any of us have to use the mill for grinding our meal we have to pay multure all the same, so that we have to pay double.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",16
"17","1159. Sheriff Nicolson",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",17
"18","—Where is the mill?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",18
"19","—At Tote.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",19
"20","1160. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",20
"21","—What are the miller's dues?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",21
"22","—So much on each boll.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",22
"23","1161. How much?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",23
"24","—The miller is here present, and will speak for that.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",24
"25","1162. Do you never take corn to the mill?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",25
"26","—I have taken corn to the mill, but I could not tell the quantity the miller took out. I do not know the capacity of his measure.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",26
"27","1163. What amount of corn ought to make a boll of meal?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",27
"28","—We have not more than half a boll with the sort of oats that we have. The worst kind of our oats would not yield more than three stones to the boll. In a good year, and with oats from a strong ground, a boll of oats might possibly yield seven stones on the average.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",28
"29","1164. Professor Mackinnon.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",29
"30","—That is after potatoes ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",30
"31","—Yes.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",31
"32","1165. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",32
"33","—Does it come better out after potatoes than after grass ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",33
"34","—We have no fences, and have no experience.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",34
"35","1166. The Chairman.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",35
"36","—You stated that the crofters on your township originally paid their rent to the tacksman ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",36
"37","—Yes.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",37
"38","1167. And that they now pay their rent direct to the propretor?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",38
"39","— Yes.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",39
"40","1168. Are there many crofters still paying their rent direct to tacksmen ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",40
"41","—Not in my district.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",41
"42","1169. When they paid their rent to the tacksmen, were they better or worse off than they are since they paid their rent to the proprietor ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",42
"43","—No, we are not better off now. We are becoming poorer each year. We are worse off now than we were then.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",43
"44","1170. Do they generally consider in the country that it is better to pay the rent to the tacksman or to the proprietor direct?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",44
"45","—We consider it better to be paying the rent to the proprietor direct. When we pay to the proprietor direct we have only to make money payment, but when we had to pay the rent to the tacksman we had other duties laid upon us as well as the money obligation. The services which we used to render to the tacksman, in addition to the money payment, are now included in the rent which we pay to the landlord.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",45
"46","1171. What was the nature of the services rendered to the tacksman?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",46
"47","—We used to give him in spring a day's harrowing, and in autumn two days' reaping his corn. So we and the crofters would be cutting the tacksman's peats also, and those of whom no service was required had to give compensation to the tacksman in the shape of the value of a lamb. Then the value of the lamb at first was stated at 2s. 6d., and as the price of sheep was increasing it came to be 5s., and that is included now in the rent which we pay. ",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",47
"48","1172. Sheriff Nicolson.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",48
"49","—The 5s. ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",49
"50","—Yes, the 5s. is included.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",50
"51","1173. The Chairman.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",51
"52","—Are there still crofters paying rent to tacksmen and rendering those duties and services?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",52
"53","—Unless such are in M'Leod's country, there are none of them in this part of the country. We are complaining also of the smallness of our holdings. I believe that even should they get enlarged holdings, they are so much sunk in poverty, that unless the Government would assist the people to stock the enlarged holdings, they would be as badly off as ever.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",53
"54","1174. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",54
"55","—If they have difficulty in getting stock for their holdings, would any of them be willing to emigrate to another country, where there are more openings ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",55
"56","—I cannot say that, but there is plenty of land in this country itself which could be apportioned to them, and which would support the whole of them.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",56
"57","1175. But if they cannot stock this land without Government help, or the help of charitable people; if they are not in a position to avail themselves of this other land, even if it were given to them, would they be willing to go to another country where they could benefit themselves by the land ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",57
"58","—I cannot answer that question for the others, but I know the greater part of them would not be able to stock the land unless they would get assistance.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",58
"59","1176. Sheriff Nicolson.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",59
"60","—Cau you speak for yourself?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",60
"61","—For my own part, should I get an enlarged holding, I would be able to stock it.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",61
"62","1177. Where do you send your children to school?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",62
"63","—I am not putting them to any school. We have no road to the school, and we are far from the school.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",63
"64","1178. Do any of the Uigshader people send their children to school?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",64
"65","—None of them who are on the upper side of the watershed.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",65
"66","1179. How far are you from the nearest school ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",66
"67","—The school of Borve is the nearest. I believe it is about 3 miles from some of us. How can you expect weakly children to travel 3 miles in the dead of winter, without a road and without any sheltering place intervening?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",67
"68","1180. Is there no road between you and Borve?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",68
"69","—No.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",69
"70","1181. How far are you from Glenmore school ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",70
"71","—There are mountains between us and the Glenmore school.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",71
"72","1182. How far are you from the nearest church?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",72
"73","—This church in which we are met is the nearest to it.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",73
"74","1183. Is there a road from you to the church?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",74
"75","—No, and we pay road money, and yet all that we carry to our townships we have to curry on our backs.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",75
"76","1184. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",76
"77","—Of school age, how many children are there in your district ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",77
"78","—Upwards of fifty children, if not above fifty.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",78
"79","1185. How long is it since any of them have been at school ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",79
"80","—At times an odd child might be coming for a week or two to school; but they had a little school among themselves, some years ago, and they used to attend that school regularly.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",80
"81","1186. Mr Cameron.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",81
"82","—Is there any compulsory officer?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",82
"83","—Yes.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",83
"84","1187. Sheriff Nicolson.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",84
"85","—Does he ever visit you?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",85
"86","—He frequently visits us.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",86
"87","1188. Have any of you ever been summoned before the sheriff for not sending the children to school ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",87
"88","—I cannot say that; I do not know that; but I think none of us have been summoned before the sheriff.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",88
"89","1189. Are the children getting taught at home?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",89
"90","—No ; no education at home.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",90
"91","1190. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",91
"92","— The children, do they go to church?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",92
"93","— No, not out of our township ; none of them ever go to church.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",93
"94","1191. Does a catochist come round?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",94
"95","—Yes, a catechist comes once a fortnight to hold a meeting. The minister sends him once a fortnight.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",95
"96","1192. Professor Mackinnon.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",96
"97","—Though the children do not go in the dead of winter, could they not go in the spring and summer months, especially the older ones ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",97
"98","—Yes.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",98
"99","1193. Why don't they go ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",99
"100","—I cannot tell. They are in want of shoes and clothes, and they cannot go naked to school. Very few of them can go to school in comparison with the number who cannot.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",100
"101","1194. Mr Cameron.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",101
"102","—Can none of them read or write at all ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",102
"103","—Some of them can read and write, who learn in this school.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",103
"104","1195. The Chairman.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",104
"105","—Is there anything further you wish to say before you retire ?",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",105
"106","—No more.",18,"Norman Mckenzie","Skye, Skeabost",106
