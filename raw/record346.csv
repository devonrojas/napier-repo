"28","—Some of them have.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",28
"29","19310. Do you think that if the Government were to send a training ship to this country, to show the people how the boys are brought up, they would be more inclined to enlist in the navy?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",29
"30","—I think they would.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",30
"31","19311. Have you ever seen a training ship?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",31
"32","—Yes, and I would have been glad to have been put into any of them at ten or twelve years of age.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",32
"33","19312. You think that, if the people saw how the boys were treated, they would be encouraged to enlist ?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",33

"37","19314. Is it generally known among the fishing people and poor people of the country ?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",37

"39","19315. But still you say a great number of people are going to sea?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",39
"40","—Yes, but those at home are kept very ignorant of what is doing; they are not allowed to know how they could better themselves, and they are taxed in all possible forms and ways.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",40
"41","19316. Are you now living by land or sea?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",41
"42","—By land, and on the money I saved up before. I cannot live on the croft, it cannot keep me; it is on what I saved up before that I am trying to keep my brother's family. But if I got security I might live on property. My brother had a lease, and I am holding it on at the present time.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",42
"43","19317. How long has the lease still to run ?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",43

"51","19321. What sort of drains?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",51
"52","—Open drains. I drained the property, and places which were growing weeds when I came home, are now growing white oats.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",52
"53","19322. Have you any fencing?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",53
"54","—No, I would be glad if I could get a fence on my property, to keep it from other people's cattle.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",54
"55","19323. If your proprietor would pay for half the fence, would you pay for the other half ?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",55

"58","—A wire fence.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",58
"59","19325. Is it soft ground?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",59
"60","—Not so extra soft, but what a fence would stand.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",60
"61","19326. Is it rocky ground?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",61

"71","19331. What sort of a house is there on it ?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",71

"74","—I have a small business. My brother had it before.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",74
"75","19333. Do you cure fish ?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",75
"76","—A little, but it is not much that I can get to cure.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",76
"77","19334. Are there many competitions for curing?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",77
"78","—No, there is no one but myself, but there is not much to get.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",78
"79","19335. Was your brother bound by his lease to make improvements?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",79
"80","—No.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",80

"84","—Mr Ogilvie Robertson, and now it is Mr Hastie.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",84
"85","19338. Have you and the proprietor had any differences?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",85
"86","—No, only I cannot get the house repaired, and it is becoming spoiled. If I repair it ho won't pay me for it, and if I leave it he won't give me any demurrage.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",86
"87","19339. If the roof is felt, won't you keep it water-tight?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",87
"88","—Yes, if they put the walls in repair, but the water is coming in through the walls.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",88
"89","19340. It was not repaired when your brother took it?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",89
"90","—No, and by the lease he was bound to repair it. Word was sent by the factor that I would have to put repairs on it. They will give the lime, but I don't see I am bound to do the work.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",90
"91","19341. Is there any dissatisfaction among the people in the country near you?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",91
"92","—Yes, there is a great many of them in the same position, the same as I am. If they could get leases of their property they would improve it. That is what they want",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",92
"93","19342. They want long leases?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",93
"94","—Yes, about twenty-one years.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",94
"95","19343. And then they would keep the thing going themselves?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",95
"96","—Yes, the property is going to waste as it is.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",96
"97","19344. That is the chief cause of complaint at this place?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",97
"98","—Yes, want of leases.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",98
"99","19345. Professor Mackinnon.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",99
"100","—If they had that long lease would they improve their houses too?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",100
"101","—I don't see how they could if thev pay heavy rents. I think the factor should improve the houses and repair them. That was the arrangement when the leases were made.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",101
"102","19346. You don't consider the rent too high if the proprietor did what you wish?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",102
"103","—It is rather too high, because I cannot keep cattle enough to pay the rent. If I could keep cattle enough to graze on my property and pay the rent, I would not consider it too high.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",103
"104","19347. Is it higher than the rent of the crofters about you?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",104
"105","—Yes, there is none about me paying above £5 of rent.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",105
"106","19348. Although they have a croft as big as yours?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",106
"107","—Yes.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",107
"108","19349. How do you account for yours being so high?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",108
"109","—I don't know.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",109
"110","19350. Is it because of the shop and fish-curing ?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",110
"111","—I suppose so.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",111
"112","19351. And the lease?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",112
"113","—Yes, I expect so.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",113
"114","19352. The others have not leases?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",114
"115","—No, I cannot account how the rent was raised. My brother's predecessors paid only £8 for the place.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",115
"116","19353. But they had not a shop and curing estabhshment?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",116
"117","—Yes, they had.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",117
"118","19354. You would not be inclined to enter into a new arrangement of that kind yourself. You don't think it is a good thing? ",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",118
"119","—No, I do not consider it is. But on account of keeping a family, who are all quite young, I went into it. There are eight of a family.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",119
"120","19355. You would not have taken it for yourself?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",120
"121","—No, I would not at the rent.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",121
"122","19356. Even suppose the proprietor had fulfilled the terms of the lease by putting the house in order?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",122
"123","—No, I should not have liked to take it for myself.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",123
"124","19357. Have you made any representation to the proprietor or the factor about putting the house in order?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",124
"125","—Yes.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",125
"126","19358. Who is the factor?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",126
"127","—Mr Keith.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",127
"128","19359. And did he not consider your proposal reasonable?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",128
"129","—Yes, providing he could get the sanction of the landlord, but he cannot",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",129
"130","19360. What would it cost?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",130
"131","—About £10 or £12 would put it in repair.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",131
"132","19361. The ground of dissatisfaction which the people of the district have, is that they have not leases?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",132
"133","—Yes, that they don't have leases, so far as I know.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",133
"134","19362. They don't fish much. Is that because there is no special fishing ground?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",134
"135","—There is ground, but the harbour is bad; there is not a safe harbour to come into.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",135
"136","19363. Could a harbour be easily made?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",136
"137","—I do not know if it could, because it is an open bay.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",137
"138","19364. How far are they from a suitable harbour?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",138
"139","—Mid Yell.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",139
"140","19365. How far is Mid Yell?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",140
"141","—Six or seven miles.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",141
"142","19366. And where do the young people of the place go to?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",142
"143","—They generally go to the fishing, and others go to sea.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",143
"144","19367. Are they better or worse off than in Vidian ?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",144
"145","—A good deal. worse off than where I was brought up.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",145
"146","19368. In what respect?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",146
"147","—Because their farms don't pay them, and the fishing is not so good.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",147
"148","19369. Were the farms better in Delting?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",148
"149","—Yes, and the farms were producing more; they are not producing half of what they used to do. The people are forced to leave because they cannot make a living; the young people are going away, and the old people are not fit to work or improve.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",149
"150","19370. Do you think the farm3 are big enough to keep the people without assistance from the fishing?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",150
"151","—No, the one needs to be assisted by the other—part fishing and part farming.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",151
"152","19371. Some of the family remain at the farm and some go to the fishing ?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",152
"153","—Yes.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",153
"154","19372. And that is the way they live about you?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",154
"155","—Yes. But if they had the farms more improved they could take more out of them. They have no chance; they have no demurrage for improving the farms, and they leave them worse, and don't believe in working on them. But I think, if I could work upon it, it would pay me. I would have benefit by it. The more improvements the crofter makes the greater is the benefit to himself.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",155
"156","19373. But you don't make improvements?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",156
"157","—I have made improvements in the three years I have been there; I have improved well on to three acres.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",157
"158","19374. Is the value of it increasing?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",158
"159","—Yes, I see them increasing it to me, and that is why I won't improve more. If I could have it fenced, and got it to myself, it would be different.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",159
"160","19375. Perhaps by the time the lease is out it won't be too highly rented?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",160
"161","—I do not see why they should increase it on me. If I improve ground I think the rent should not be increased, but lowered, so that I should get the value of my work.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",161
"162","19376. How do you think that could best be brought about ?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",162
"163","—I do not know exactly. I think it could be brought about very easily by looking at the value of the property when I took it, and when I leave it after my improvements.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",163
"164","19377. You would wish the law to be such that you could get the value of your improvements?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",164
"165","—Yes, from the time I commence until I leave it.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",165
"166","19378. Of course, the law is that the proprietors as well as yourself should abide by the terms of the lease?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",166
"167","—Yes, but they won't do that. They want to place you so that you cannot make them do that.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",167
"168","19379. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",168
"169","—How long have you been looking after this place?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",169
"170","—Three years and six months.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",170
"171","19380. What family were you obliged to take up?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",171
"172","—Nine of them—eight children and my brother's wife.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",172
"173","19381. Were your parents dead?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",173
"174","—My father died when I was a child. My mother is alive, and I have to support her.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",174
"175","19382. Are you spending some of your own earnings?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",175
"176","—I am spending my own earnings all the time—ever since I started here.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",176
"177","19383. What you want is encouragement from the proprietor—permanency in your holding?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",177
"178","—Yes.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",178
"179","19384. In regard to these fences, you say you would pay half the fence?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",179
"180","—Yes.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",180
"181","19385. You used the expression that the people in Shetland were kept in ignorance, what did you mean by that ?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",181
"182","—Because they don't get to know where they could get a better living. I consider I could make a better living in another country than I can do in Shetland. ",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",182
"183","19386. Are there any newspapers published in Shetland?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",183
"184","—Only the Shetland Times, and it is very small; it is not of much account. The only thing we get in it is an account of the fishing, and if we did not get a paper out of the south we should be almost entirely out of the world.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",184
"185","19387. Mr Cameron.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",185
"186","—Why don't you get a paper?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",186
"187","—I always send for one. I generally have the Scotsman or the Liverpool Mercury.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",187
"188","19388. Yet you said you did not know what was going on?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",188
"189","—Plenty don't. You might be in town yourself a century, and not know what was going on, if you had not a newspaper.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",189
"190","19389. But if you buy a paper, you have the same information as other people?",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",190

We should like to have our own pasture for which we pay, and let them keep on theirs.",346,"Hugh Hughson","Mid Yell, Raefirth",200
