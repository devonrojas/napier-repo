"11","43384. Were yon elected at a meeting?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",11
"12","—We had not a special meeting.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",12
"13","43385. How have you been chosen a delegate?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",13
"14","—Because there was no other one that would come to speak. They were afraid, or something of that sort. ",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",14
"15","43386. I only wish to understand by what process you were elected. Were you nominated by other people, or have you come forward spontaneously as the representative of other people?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",15
"16","—I came as the representative of a few of them, not the whole of them, because we had not a special meeting, but I came to represent a few of them.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",16
"17","43387. You have been privately asked to come?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",17
"18","—Yes.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",18
"19","43388. By various persons?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",19
"20","—Yes.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",20
"21","43389. Then what statement do your friends wish you to make?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",21
"22","—That we cannot live in the place—that the place is too dear for us to live in. The place is put out to carry so many sheep and so many cattle, and the place will not keep that number of sheep or cattle.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",22
"23","43390. What is Strone; is it a township?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",23
"24","—Yes, it is a township.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",24
"25","43391. How many holdings are there?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",25
"26","—There are eleven holdings.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",26
"27","43392. Has it got a common outrun or common pasture?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",27
"28","—Yes, it has a common pasture, and we are in common with two large sheep farms, and they get the better of us there.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",28
"29","43393. Do you mean you run your sheep out upon the same ground which is also pastured by sheep farmers?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",29
"30","—Yes.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",30
"31","43394. So that the stock of the sheep farmers and that of the crofters go together ?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",31
"32","—Yes.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",32
"33","43395. Ought they to go together by rights, or is it merely because there is no fence?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",33
"34","—Yes, they ought to go all together by rights; but we wish that ours should be separated, and that we should be fenced from the big farmers.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",34
"35","43396. Have you asked for a fence?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",35
"36","—No, we did not ask for a fence.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",36
"37","43397. Supposing the proprietor would put up a wire fence, would the crofters assist him in carrying the materials and help to put it up?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",37
"38","—Undoubtedly they would, but in the way we are just now it is taking the last thing out.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",38
"39","43398. Have you got leases?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",39
"40","—I got a lease last year upon condition that I would build a house and steading upon the ground. I have not got that lease. They charged me £ 3 , 10s., and I think that an enormous price to pay for a lease.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",40
"41","43399. But, speaking at present rather for the others than for yourself, have the other crofters in the township got leases?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",41
"42","—No, the only one who has a lease is myself.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",42
"43","43400. What area of arable has each crofter, on an average?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",43
"44","—The croft I have is between myself and my brother, and there are eighteen acres of it, and the rest have from seven to nine acres.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",44
"45","43401. Of arable land?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",45
"46","—Of arable land.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",46
"47","43402. Is the arable divided by a fence from the pasture?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",47
"48","—It has been done this year by the proprietor. He has divided it.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",48
"49","43403. What sort of fence is it?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",49
"50","—A wire fence.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",50
"51","43404. Do the people keep sheep upon the common pasture, or only cattle?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",51
"52","—Sheep.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",52
"53","43405. Supposing a man has eight or nine acres of arable, how many sheep will he have?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",53
"54","—There are 1000 sheep put out for the whole of our township.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",54
"55","43406. Then a man who has eight acres of arable would usually have how many sheep?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",55
"56","—One hundred and ten, if he had nine acres.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",56
"57","43407. Nine acres of arable and one hundred and ten sheep; what cattle does he keep generally?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",57
"58","—Four cows and one stirk.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",58
"59","43408. Any horses?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",59
"60","—One horse.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",60
"61","43409. What is his rent?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",61
"62","—£21, 5s.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",62
"63","43410. Has your township been deprived of any hill pasture?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",63
"64","—It has been deprived of the low pasture, and that is what makes us suffer altogether. It has been planted, all except our arable ground.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",64
"65","43411. The lower part of the hill pasture has been planted?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",65
"66","—Yes.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",66
"67","43412. When it was planted, were the rents of the crofts reduced?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",67
"68","—No, they were not, but they were put up at that time. The whole township was put up £50 at that time.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",68
"69","43413. How old is the plantation now?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",69
"70","—Either seven or eight years.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",70
"71","43414. Was it the best part of the hill pasture which was planted?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",71
"72","—It was, undoubtedly.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",72
"73","43415. When this good piece of hill pasture was taken away did the proprietor give the crofters any other compensation or benefit?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",73
"74","—We got a small thing on the other side of the Spey, but the water is between us, and it does us very little good.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",74
"75","43416. Was it for cutting hay upon?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",75
"76","—No, for feeding the cows.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",76
"77","43417. How do the cows get over the water?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",77
"78","—It is very bad for them to cross the water. They lose more by going over there than they gain by it, and they cannot get there but very seldom.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",78
"79","43418. There is no bridge near hand?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",79
"80","—There is no bridge at all.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",80
"81","43419. However, the people have not given up the piece of pasture—they have not surrendered it?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",81
"82","—No.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",82
"83","43420. They keep it?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",83
"84","—They keep the pasture.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",84
"85","43421. So it looks as if it was of some value?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",85
"86","—Yes, undoubtedly it is of some value. There is another thing. We are taxed for a road, and we don't get anything done in our township for the road. Our neighbours in Glen Banchor get their road repaired every year, and there are only two or three townships there, but in our township there is nothing done at all. It was repaired for four or five years at the time Mr Macpherson of the British Linen Bank was taking sheep from our fank, and every time he was there the road was repaired; but since then there has been no word of it.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",86
"87","43422. Am I to understand generally that the complaint is that the rent is too high?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",87
"88","—Yes, and that there is no feeding for the stock we have on the ground, and that we don't want to be iu common with the big farmers.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",88
"89","43423. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",89
"90","—What are the farms with which you have grazing in common?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",90
"91","—One is in the proprietor's own hands, and the other is Glen Banchor, now in the possession of a large farmer.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",91
"92","43424. What stock is there in Glen Banchor?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",92
"93","—One thousand sheep.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",93
"94","43425. And on the farm in the proprietor's hands?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",94
"95","—Eight hundred.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",95
"96","43426. What stock is your crofter township entitled to keep?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",96
"97","—A thousand sheep; but there is another township which is in common too, and there are about 700 in that township.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",97
"98","43427. Does your township keep 1000 sheep?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",98
"99","—Yes, or very near it.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",99
"100","43428. Have those 1000 sheep worse grazing than the sheep belonging to the other farms that have a right to the common pasture?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",100
"101","—The other farms have very low ground. They have it fenced, and our sheep when they are in common with them are not fenced, and their sheep will come into our ground at this time of the year when they don't get into their own ground. They have good arable ground when they come into it, and plenty of meat, and when our sheep come into it there is nothing.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",101
"102","43429. I understand that was so in former years, but now your low ground is fenced?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",102
"103","—It is fenced between the arable land and the low pasture ground. There is ground put out which is not in common, for use in the latter end of the year, and that ground is not fenced.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",103
"104","43430. And if that ground were fenced it would give you what you want?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",104
"105","—Yes, it would give us what we want j and to value our ground for what stock it would keep, and to pay for them. ",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",105
"106","43431. Do you mean you are paying more highly for your stock on the common pasture than the tenants on the other farms are paying?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",106
"107","—I don't mean to say that, because I don't know whether we are or not, but I mean to say there are a good many more sheep in common than are able to live upon it, and then our sheep have not feeding in the winter time the same as the others have, and it is from that we suffer most.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",107
"108","43432. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",108
"109","—Does the proprietor live in the neighbourhood?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",109
"110","—Yes.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",110
"111","43433. And I suppose he is accessible to all his tenants?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",111
"112","—Yes, he is. He is very easy to speak to.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",112
"113","43434. Why have you not gone to him and made a representation either in a body or by a deputation to represent your case?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",113
"114","—Because we think it is useless.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",114
"115","43435. There is a large population about Clunes and Newtonmore, on the same estate?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",115
"116","—Yes.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",116
"117","43436. And there are some fine glens there",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",117
"118","—Glen Balloch and Glen Banchor?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",118
"119","—Yes.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",119
"120","43437. Who has got them just now?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",120
"121","—Mr Macarthur.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",121
"122","43438. Is there plenty room for all the Clunes people up there?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",122
"123","—In Glen Banchor they may go there, but there are enough already.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",123
"124","43439. I don't mean to put them there, but suppose this farmer gave up the place, or it came into the proprietor's hands, would there be plenty of room there?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",124
"125","—Plenty room there.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",125
"126","43440. Do your people belong to the estate? Have you been there for some time?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",126
"127","—Yes.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",127
"128","43441. I suppose all the Strone people are old residenters?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",128
"129","—Yes, they have been on the estate for generations past",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",129
"130","43442. And probably they expect the proprietor would be kinder to them than to a stranger?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",130
"131","—Yes, they do expect that, but they don't think it is the case. Of course this present proprietor is very good to his tenants. He gives them almost everything that is wanted. If it were stated right to him what was wanted, I don't think but what he would give it.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",131
"132","43443. But he has heard the story to-day?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",132
"133","—Yes, I think he has heard it to-day.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",133
"134","43444. Mr Cameron.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",134
"135","—How many of the eleven tenants asked you to come here and speak for them?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",135
"136","—Four of them.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",136
"137","43445. What did the other seven say?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",137
"138","—I was not personally speaking to the other seven. We have all the same tale in all our gatherings —how we are used, and how our sheep are in a mesh; and next year we shall be much worse, as The Mackintosh of Mackintosh is to make a forest on the other side of the hill where our sheep go just now, and it is in every gathering where two or three meet together —' What is to become of our sheep if that is made a forest of —whether they are to be driven further away or whether he is to fence it?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",138
"139","43446. That refers to the future, but as to the existing state of things these four people asked you to speak for them?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",139
"140","—Yes.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",140
"141","43447. And the seven did not?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",141
"142","—Yes.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",142
"143","43448. Do you know if any of the other crofters ever asked about this fence?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",143
"144","—I don't think they have.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",144
"145","43449. How long would it require to be in order to be of use?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",145
"146","—If we got the fencing the same as the other farms have, I think it would require to be three miles, if we got our half hill fenced the same as the other farms have it, but there are about twenty crofters on the length of three miles; for there is another township of crofters, and I don't think there is any delegate to speak for them here. Of course, we crofters will agree better in common than we do with the large farmers.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",146
"147","43450. The Chairman.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",147
"148","—Speaking of the amount of rent, you said there were four cows and one stirk. I want to know whether the crofters in your township are obliged to buy in fodder for the cows in winter, or can they keep the cows on the stuff grown on the ground?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",148
"149","—They are obliged to buy in stuff for winter; and as to the feeding they have in the summer time, it will be half the year, because there is not proper feeding in the summer time.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",149
"150","43151. How are your houses built?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",150
"151","—It was the reason I got a lease that I took in hand to build a slated house, and the proprietor was to",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",151
"152","supply me with all the materials, but I was to pay for the carting of the material myself. That was the reason why I got a lease, or why I shall get it if I pay £3, 10s. for it.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",152
"153","43452. Generally speaking, what kind of houses are they; are they old black houses or good houses?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",153
"154","—They are mostly the old black houses.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",154
"155","43453. Sheriff Nicolson.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",155
"156","—What would you consider a fair rent instead of the £21, 5s. which you are paying just now?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",156
"157","—Well, I don't consider anything fair till we would have just a proper grazing for our beasts.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",157
"158","43454. How many pounds instead of £21 would you think a reasonable rent?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",158
"159","—The last rise that was put on the place was £ 3 on every £12. But there were one hundred more sheep put upon our township at that time, and all the rest were added to greatly, and ever since that time every one has enough to do to eke out a living.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",159
"160","43455. But you have not answered my question. What do you think you should be paying instead of the £21? Do you think it should be £15 or anything like that?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",160
"161","—I should think that would be quite sufficient. I think if one-third of all the sheep on the hill were put off and one-third of the cattle, and the rent reduced greatly, we could live.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",161
"162","43456. When was the rent last raised?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",162
"163","—About nine or ten years ago.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",163
"164","43457. By £ 3?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",164
"165","—£3 for every £12.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",165
"166","43458. How many sheep are you able to keep instead of 110 which is your summing?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",166
"167","—I have that number.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",167
"168","43459. If it is a fair question, how much did you get out of these 110 sheep last year?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",168
"169","—For instance, I bought in fifty-three young wedder hogs last Whitsunday, and all I was able to send away this year was forty. All the rest died, and I thought it was the want of feeding that was the cause of it.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",169
"170","43460. Are you not able to make a good comfortable living off your croft?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",170
"171","—No, the way we are just now, it is impossible for us to make a good living.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",171
"172","43461. Have you not corn or potatoes enough out of your ground to support you?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",172
"173","—Yes, there are plenty for us, but to pay the rent and everything that follows it we are not able to pay our way.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",173
"174","43462. Do you mean that you are in debt?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",174
"175","—Yes, I mean to say I am losing money.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",175
"176","43463. And do you think your neighbours are so too?",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",176
"177","—Yes, I think so. Some of them are more lucky than others in getting jobs out by.",705,"Alexander Stewart","Inverness-shire, Kingussie",177
