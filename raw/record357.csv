"35","—Yes, far more.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",35
"36","20158. Does you landlord live in the island?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",36
"37","—No, in Yell.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",37
"38","20159. Have you ever remonstrated with him against this rise?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",38

"43","—I don't know.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",43
"44","20162. And you don't want to pay the increased rent?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",44
"45","—It has been paid in time past.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",45

"64","20172. But, formerly, did you use to leave some of it fallow?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",64
"65","—No, I cropped it.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",65

"80","—I don't know; they are leaving and going into big boats. ",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",80

"94","—When they come to fourteen they are not caring whether they go to school or not.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",94
"95","20187. I thought they cared to go to school?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",95
"96","—But the schoolmasters are not caring; the children are desired to go to school when they are not fit; and when they are fit, the schoolmaster don't care whether they go or not",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",96
"97","20188. What do you think would be a suitable age for them to go to school to begin with?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",97
"98","—I think they are not fit for much schooling before they are seven or eight years old.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",98
"99","20189. And then they should be kept at school until they are fourteen or fifteen, would that be the proper age?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",99
"100","—Yes; for they are not fit, when they are so young, to travel through the snow without roads. There are places where there is no road at all; nothing but wild moors.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",100
"101","20190. Where do you get your stores.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",101
"102","—We have to get them from Balta Sound.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",102

"106","—Some have them, but a great many have none.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",106
"107","20193. But those who have them use them?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",107
"108","—Yes; but there are no ponies in our place except two belonging to one man.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",108
"109","20194 Do they use the ponies, where they have them, to plough land ?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",109
"110","—Yes, those who have big farms.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",110
"111","20195. How do they till the land in your place?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",111
"112","—We delve it all with a spade,",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",112
"113","20196. Suppose you had your croft at the old rent, is it big enough to support your family?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",113
"114","—No.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",114
"115","20197. You must, therefore, depend for your living upon the sea?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",115
"116","—Generally. Only the proprietor has split every farm in two to increase it for fishermen, and that has made the holdings far too small.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",116
"117","20198. Is he a curer himself?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",117
"118","—He did cure, but he has given it up now.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",118
"119","20199. When did he give it up?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",119
"120","—About ten years ago.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",120
"121","20200. Has the rent been raised since that time?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",121
"122","—No; but it was raised before that.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",122
"123","20201. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",123
"124","—Did you ever sell the wool of your sheep?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",124
"125","—Yes, several times.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",125
"126","20202. What did you get for it?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",126
"127","—I have had to buy for some time;",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",127
"128","but when I was selling it, I got 8d. and 10d. and Is. a pound.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",128
"129","20203. What do you pay now?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",129
"130","—Last year we were paying Is. 6d. and 2s. for good wool.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",130
"131","20204. That is for Shetland wool?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",131
"132","—No, for Cheviot wool.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",132
"133","20205. And what would you pay for the old Shetland wool?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",133
"134","—I know it has been sold for Is. 2d.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",134
"135","20206. At the same time you were paying Is. 6d. for the wool of the big sheep. Then the wool of Shetland sheep is cheaper than that of the big sheep?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",135
"136","—It was cheaper.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",136
"137","20207. Was it cheaper last year?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",137
"138","—Yes; but this year I don't know what it is.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",138
"139","20208. From whom do you buy your wool?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",139
"140","—I bought some from Mr Hamilton this year,—blackfaced wool.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",140
"141","20209. And you paid Is. 6d.?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",141
"142","—No, not blackfaced wool. Cheviot wool is cheaper this year; Mr Edmonston has been selling it at Is.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",142
"143","20210. Mr Cameron.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",143
"144","—What do you do with the Cheviot wool when you get it?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",144
"145","—I never bought any of it.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",145
"146","20211. What did you do with the blackfaced?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",146
"147","—I sent it South and got stuff made with it.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",147
"148","20212. Has Mr Hamilton got a stock of blackfaced sheep?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",148
"149","—Yes.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",149
"150","20213. What did you pay for the blackfaced wool?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",150
"151","—I could not say; I have not settled for it",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",151
"152","20214. Do you know what you will have to pay for it?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",152
"153","—-I could not tell; he is here.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",153
"154","20215. But haven't you some idea of the price?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",154
"155","—Well, Mr Edmonston sold some Cheviot wool this year for Is.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",155
"156","20216. But I am talking of what you have bought, —have you no idea of what you will have to pay?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",156
"157","—I think it will be about 7d. per lb. for blackfaced wool.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",157
"158","20217. The sheep which you keep are small Shetland sheep?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",158
"159","—Yes.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",159
"160","20218. Would your land keep a better class of sheep—bigger sheep? ",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",160
"161","—No, it is not adopted for that, it is heathery hills.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",161
"162","20219. Is there any land in your neighbourhood adopted for that?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",162
"163","—No.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",163
"164","20220. Not even blackfaced sheep?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",164
"165","—Yes; but Shetland sheep are the hardiest.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",165
"166","20221. At what age do you sell Shetland sheep?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",166
"167","—They are generally kept until we cannot keep them longer.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",167
"168","20222. You allow them to die of old age?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",168
"169","—The greater part of them died of old age some time back we keep them until they are eight or ten or twelve years ago.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",169
"170","20223. Is not that a rather primitive mode of farming?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",170
"171","—They were always kept for their lambs and their wool.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",171
"172","20224. When they sold them at all, what price did they get for them, and to whom did they sell them?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",172
"173","—Just one neighbour to the other.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",173
"174","20225. What price did they get?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",174
"175","—7s. for a Shetland ewe—they thought that a good price—and 5s. and 2s. 6d. for a lamb.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",175
"176","20226. And for a wether sheep?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",176
"177","—They could be somewhat dearer.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",177
"178","20227. How much?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",178
"179","—I have seen them sold at 8s. and 9s.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",179
"180","20228. Have you no idea what the value of a blackfaced sheep would be?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",180
"181","—No.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",181
"182","20229. Did you ever inquire as to whether it would not be more profitable to keep a breed of blackfaced sheep?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",182
"183","—No.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",183
"184","20230. Supposing you were told that a blackfaced wether, after keeping it so long, would sell for about £2, would you think that a profitable bargain?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",184
"185","—I do not know, I am sure; blackfaced sheep are things we are not much used to; we have always had the old Shetland sheep.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",185
"186","20231. But, apparently, Mr Hamilton has a breed of blackfaced sheep?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",186
"187","—Yes.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",187
"188","20232. Is his land much better than the land you have?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",188
"189","—His is a farm laid down for sheep.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",189
"190","20233. Are you aware that in Scotland crofters who hold the same quantity of land, as you do, keep a breed of blackfaced sheep and sell. them at the market prices, whatever they may be?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",190
"191","—I don't know.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",191
"192","20234. Don't you think it would be worth while to inquire whether you could not raise sheep, and which would sell for £2 rather than 7s.?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",192
"193","—It would be, if we had only the property to raise them on.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",193
"194","20235. Does anybody in the island keep blackfaced sheep except Mr Hamilton?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",194
"195","—Yes, Mr Edmonston.",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",195
"196","20236. Do they seem to answer?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",196
"197","—They are hardy animals. ",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",197
"198","20237. Do you see any reason why they should not be introduced into Shetland ?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",198
"199","—Because the wool of them is awful coarse. ",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",199
"200","20238. But if you can make as much as I have stated off the carcase would not that compensate for the inferior quality of the wool?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",200
"201","—Yes; I  should say the one would pay up what the other wanted. ",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",201
"202","20239. You said your wife had died and that you had to give up some of the land; what did you mean by that?",357,"Thomas Abernethy","Unst, Baltasound",202
