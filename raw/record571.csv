"1","RONALD MACDONALD, Cottar, Heanish (46)—examined.",571,"Ronald Macdonald","Argyll, Tyree",1
"2","34252. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",571,"Ronald Macdonald","Argyll, Tyree",2
"3","—You have a paper?",571,"Ronald Macdonald","Argyll, Tyree",3
"4","—Yes.",571,"Ronald Macdonald","Argyll, Tyree",4
"5","—' To the Honourable the Royal Commissioners appointed to inquire into the Condition of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. The Statement of Ronald M' Donald (46), cottar and cattle dealer, Heanish, for Heanish and Baugh cottars—Humbly sheweth, That many of the cottars of Heanish and Baugh were deprived of their holdings, either directly or indirectly, to make room for tacks, as in the case of one party who was deprived of his holding at Baugh, then partly cleared to make an addition to the tack of Reef, and same party again was evicted from his croft at Heanish to make room for a blind man and his family from Hylipool, then a crofter township, but which was at this time converted into a tack. This party never received a penny for his outlay in house erection, but had to build  another house at his own expense down at the sea-shore; and ejectments were served upon us during our occupancy of the crofts for being one day behind in ploughing our turnip ground, and fines imposed for fictitious faults, and had to be paid on rent day, for such as if any of our horses should break in accidentally from one part of our common to another part, both which was our own by right. The sums paid for each collectively amounts to £17. The late John Campbell, Esq., was factor for his Grace the Duke of Argyll. Cases could be cited where the crofters were evicted to make room for factor's servants and favourites. The result is that many are reduced to poverty; their only employment in winter is gathering tangles for the British Sea-weed Company, and making kelp in spring for the same company whenever they get the chance of doing so, those of them who do not go to the fishing. What we desire is a few acres arable land and as much grazing as will be a sufficient keep for a cow or two.'",571,"Ronald Macdonald","Argyll, Tyree",5
"6","—' Also Scaranish cottars' statement by Duncan M'Kinuon, crofter formerly, but now labourer, age fifty-five. My father and grandfather occupied the croft or holding from time immemorial and paid the rent, yet evicted to make room for sheep. My father was seventy-five years of age when we were evicted. The croft was about eight acres, giving plenty of work : and returns to keep us comfortably.",571,"Ronald Macdonald","Argyll, Tyree",6
"7","—' Also Archibald M'Kinnon, shoemaker, crofter's son, age forty-three, deprived of the place for which his father paid £50 for the goodwill of it in Scaranish, and never received a penny for our loss there. There was a large family of us thrown out.",571,"Ronald Macdonald","Argyll, Tyree",7
"8","—Also the whole of Scaranish crofters, numbering twenty-two families, were badly used; twelve families went to America, and a number of them died on the passage through want of proper food and allowance. The rest were allowed to remain and got their lots increased, but subsequently all of them were evicted and reduced to poverty. ""We humbly pray that our crofts shall be restored to us again, for which we are willing  to pay fair rent with fixity of tenure.",571,"Ronald Macdonald","Argyll, Tyree",8
