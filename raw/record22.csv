"1","HUGH McNab, Kildonan, Lynedale—examined. ",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",1
"2","1291. The Chairman.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",2
"3","—What is your occupation ?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",3
"4","—My son is a crofter, and I am in my son's place. Will I begin my story with the previous landlord or with the present landlord?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",4
"5","1292. How far back with the previous landlord?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",5
"6","—Thirty-four years ago.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",6
"7","1293. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",7
"8","—We will take the present landlord?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",8
"9","—The present landlord raised our rent 31s. and I am in the land in which I was settled by Mr M'Leman; and others of the crofters have had their rents raised £2, 5s. and some £2. £4, 43. at first was the rent of my croft, and there was a rise of 3ls. upon that £4, 4s. of rent. One or two paid the original rent for one or two years after the present landlord entered, and then it was raised. The rent was raised on others from £2 to £2, 2s. ",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",9
"10","He took the sheep from the poor tenants. Our present landlord took our sheep and lambs from us at 4s. 6d.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",10
"11","1294. The Chairman.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",11
"12","—Will you state the amount of stock which your own croft keeps ? How many cows, stirks, and so on ?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",12
"13","—In summer and autumn we could keep two cows and a stirk if we had them; but in winter, owing to the bad crofts we have, we can only winter one cow. We have no sheep and no horse.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",13
"14","1295. Sheriff Nicolson.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",14
"15","—When were the sheep taken from you?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",15
"16","—The landlord took the sheep stock from us a few years after his entry into the property, and we were obliged to sell them to him at 4s. 6d. the ewe and lamb.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",16
"17","1296. The Chairman.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",17
"18","—When the sheep were taken away was the rent reduced, or did they continue to pay the same rent as they did before the sheep were taken away ?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",18
"19","—The rent was raised. Then he took the hill pasture from us as well as that, and left us with only a little bit you could call a pin-fold.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",19
"20","1297. Why did the proprietor take the hill pasture away?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",20
"21","—His own will.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",21
"22","1298. Sheriff Nicolson.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",22
"23","—Did he take it into his own hands?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",23
"24","—He took it into his own hands, and stocked it himself, and let it to the others for rent. He treated the Brebost tenants in the same way.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",24
"25","1299. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",25
"26","—To whom did he let part of the land?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",26
"27","—To his own nephew—Peter Campbell. The proprietor himself has it now stocked with sheep, and as to the pin-fold left with us he took a bit of it from us again, and settled two other tenants upon it at a rental of £11. One of these tenants is dead, and the remainder is in possession of the other; and we have only a very small bit of pasturage. We are continually trespassed upon by the propietor's sheep. In winter his sheep are constantly trespassing upon us, and eating up our crops—corn and everything; and I have often had to rise up at night and cover myself with my bed coverlet in winter to drive the sheep away. But, by the Queen's authority, I have a dog this year, and with the assistance of the dog I am keeping the lands cleared now. We are making our living by fishing. I never could get a boll of meal out of my crops, for every boll of meal I could take out of my land I had to replace it in seed time. If I make a boll of meal I have to replace it with a boll of seed.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",27
"28","1300. The Chairman.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",28
"29","—If the proprietor could be induced to give back the hill pasture, or some other corresponding piece of pasture, would the crofters be satisfied?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",29
"30","—We would be satisfied if we could get grazing on which we could keep a stock of sheep and cattle, and arable land which we would work with the cas-chrom. There are seven cottars between our townships and Flashader. Three of these cottars are on our ground and four on the ground of Flashader.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",30
"31","1301. Do the cottars pay rent to the crofters?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",31
"32","—No, nothing.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",32
"33","1302. Do they pay rent to the landlord?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",33
"34","—No.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",34
"35","1303. Instead of rent, do they work at harvest time or render any other service to the crofters ?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",35
"36","—No service whatever.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",36
"37","1304. How do they live ?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",37
"38","—Some of them are on the poors roll.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",38
"39","1305. Who gave them leave to settle upon the croft?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",39
"40","—The proprietor.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",40
"41","1306. Have you anything more to say?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",41
"42","—We used to be cutting peats for the landlord at first at 7s. 6d. an iron. The last year we performed this service he sent bis grieve to measure our work and he instructed the grieve to double the measurement, and in that way he lost one iron's work. We were working five years cutting his peats, for which he gave us nothing.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",42
"43","1307. The Chairman.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",43
"44","—What do you mean by an iron?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",44
"45","—120 yards in length, 2 peats in depth, and 6 peats broad in the lower and 7 in the upper row. We want pasture for stock and ground in which we can plant crops; a place in which we can keep sheep and cattle, and a horse. We would be the better of it. We have no shore, and the proprietor takes payment from us for the sea-weed. We had no means of planting this ground this year had it not been for Dr Fraser. He gave us a boll of the seed oats each. My own son and another young lad were getting plenty of fish in Loch Grishornish with the hand line. They went to get mussels, and Mr Robertson summoned them to Portree, I cannot get fishing because of Mr Robertson of Grishornish.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",45
"46","1308. Do you say you are prevented gathering mussels on the shore for bait by Mr Robertson of Grishornish?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",46
"47","—Yes.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",47
"48","1309. Does Mr Robertson allow you to get the mussels for payment, or does he prevent it altogether ?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",48
"49","—I do not know. We are not going the way of his shore now; but before Mr Robertson ever came to the country I was getting as many mussels as I liked without let or hindrance there.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",49
"50","1310. How far are you from the shore?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",50
"51","—The shore is below me.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",51
"52","1311. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",52
"53","—How far are you from Mr Robertson's shore?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",53
"54","—Mr Robertson lives on the other side of Loch Grishornish.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",54
"55","1312. The Chairman",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",55
"56","—How far are you from the place where you used to gather the mussels ?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",56
"57","—Ten minutes' sail by boat. The beach is two and a half miles from me.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",57
"58","1313. But there is an oyster bed upon that shore?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",58
"59","—Yes.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",59
"60","1314. And Mr Robertson has got the right to those oysters?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",60
"61","—I do not know.",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",61
"62","1315. That is why he prohibits people from getting mussels?",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",62
"63","—I did not know that. Mr Robertson has got oyster beds there, but if he has a light to the shore, he ought to put up public notices that we might know his marks. It is plenty of land that we want, on which we can rear a crop and sheep, as the Gaelic proverb says—It is time about that the bellows 'are worked'",22,"Hugh Mcnab","Skye, Skeabost",63
