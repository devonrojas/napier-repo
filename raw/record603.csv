"1","WILLIAM HENDERSON HARDIE, Managing Trustee on Lochaline Estate (51)—examined.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",1
"2","36491. The Chairman.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",2
"3","—Have you any statement you wish to make connected with anything that has occurred here to-day?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",3
"4","—Yes, I would like to make some explanations. With regard to the statement that was read on behalf of the crofters, I am perfectly certain it was worded in a way that no crofter in Morven would understand, and I take it for granted it must have been the production of Mr Macdonald who gave evidence last. He stated in connection with the property I have charge of that the people were summarily evicted. Now, I can give my testimony to the contrary. The people got notice that they would require to leave their holdings in March of 1865, but an arrangement was made with them that they would be allowed to retain their holdings not only till Whitsunday but to the year following, that they might have an opportunity of seeing what they could turn their attention to. Intimation was made in March 1865, and they were allowed to remain until 1866. With regard to stating that they got no compensation, their sheep stock was taken over by the proprietor at a valuation. The houses belonged to the proprietor, and it was understood that when one tenant entered a house it was valued for him, and any depreciation upon the house he had to make good; the house belonged altogether to the proprietor, so (hat they could not expect any compensation. One statement was made that the proprietor deprived them of the privilege of cutting peat. That, I am happy to state, I can deny. What was put a stop to, and what every proprietor would put a stop to, was the cutting of turf on the surface of the rock, baring the rock. But to this day they can cut peat to their heart's content, although certainly we will prohibit them cutting the turf and baring the ground. It was also stated—I do not know whether I heard correctly or not —but the impression was conveyed, as has been conveyed in letters which have appeared in the country newspapers —that the proprietor by the use of the crowbar and faggot turned people out of their houses, which is quite contrary to the fact. It was also stated that the ground now, compared with what it was when the crofters sat upon it, is comparatively useless; whereas if you turn to the valuation roll when the property was bought and the valuation roll as it now stands, it is now paying a taxation on several hundred pounds more. With regard to stating that the people are in poverty in this parish and badly off,' for this part of it I can say there is no district in Scotland where any man who is able to work is better off with regard to wages; and I think even if Mr Macdonald was here, if he was jimp of milk at his birth, he would get more than he had then. I may say that, after Mrs Paterson got possession of the property, she rebuilt workmen's houses and slated them; whereas formerly the most of the houses were dry-stone houses with turf roofs —thatched roofs. And since the property came into the possession of the trustees by Government order we have been able to build a pier at an expense of £3000, and a roadway which has cost above £700. We have also opened up a freestone quarry, and are offering feus to the public; and if there is anything which the Commissioners can recommend that the trustees can carry out we shall only be too glad.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",4
"5","36492. You first stated that the people were not summarily removed. I did not understand the expression of the word summarily to mean that they were instantly removed, or at the end of forty days, but that they were removed altogether against their will; however, whatever meaning the expression has, I understand the people were allowed upwards of one year to prepare themselves for the removal ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",5
"6","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",6
"7","36493. How many persons were removed with this warning of one year—how many heads of families ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",7
"8","—I cannot say. I take for granted that what they say is correct.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",8
"9","36494. Were you acquainted with the country at that time yourself?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",9
"10","—No.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",10
"11","36495. Suppose there were about twenty heads of families, what was the object of this wholesale clearance of the people?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",11
"12","—So far as I can understand it was a disadvantage to a sheep farm to have little bits of corn expand where the sheep were all going round.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",12
"13","36496. Did it ever suggest itself to the minds of the managers or proprietors at that time that a fence might have been put up ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",13
"14","—It might have been, but the buildings themselves were of so little value—none of those crofters' buildings were valued above £ 8 or £10.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",14
"15","36497. The reason of their removal was that their presence was inconvenient to the neighbouring sheep farmer ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",15
"16","—Not only that, but they were not employing themselves in any occupation, such as fishing or that, to bring them in a livelihood.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",16
"17","36498. They were removed from their little farms in order that they might obtain profitable employment for themselves ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",17
"18","—Those were not little farms, but crofts.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",18
"19","36499. What sort of average value do you suppose they were ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",19
"20","—Between £3 and £4, I suppose, except one part of the property where there was a sort of club farm.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",20
"21","36500. Had they any hill pasture attached to them, those small crofts ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",21
"22","—Not the small crofts. The club farm had the whole arable and hill ground too.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",22
"23","36501. You state that it was an erroneous statement to say they were removed without compensation, and the form of compensation which you say was given to them was that their stock was taken over at a valuation?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",23
"24","—I said that no compensation could be expected for the houses when they belonged to the proprietors.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",24
"25","36502. But you did state, as an advantage which was given to them, that their stock was taken over at a valuation ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",25
"26","—The crofters had no stock except their cows.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",26
"27","36503. And it was taken over ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",27
"28","—No, but I sold the sheep stock.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",28
"29","36504. But you do not state that as any form of compensation?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",29
"30","—No.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",30
"31","36505. Had they liberty to sell the sheep stock in any form they pleased ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",31
"32","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",32
"33","36506. You said they had no claim of compensation on account of the houses, but you also said that they were bound to make good to the proprietor any depreciation in the value of the houses which might occur during their tenure; did they on leaving their houses pay to the proprietor any compensation for injury to their houses?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",33
"34","—On looking over the comprisement book, I did not come upon any cases where the houses had been improved.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",34
"35","36507. I understood you to say that they were bound to pay the proprietor compensation for any depreciation of value the houses incurred while they were there ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",35
"36","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",36
"37","36508. Did they on leaving the place pay the proprietor any compensation on account of depreciation ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",37
"38","—I say I did not see, in looking over the comprisement book, any improvement they made upon their houses.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",38
"39","36509. Did the proprietor build the houses originally?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",39
"40","—The houses belonged to the proprietor. I cannot say how they were originally built.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",40
"41","36510. You do not know whether it was by the proprietor or tenant?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",41
"42","—From any books I have seen that belonged to the former proprietor, I should say he gave money for them to build houses.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",42
"43","36511. But you did not find any evidence that the people who left paid the proprietor any indemnity or compensation for their own removal ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",43
"44","—No.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",44
"45","36512. As I understand your statement, the people were removed for the benefit of the sheep farm, and you may say for the benefit of the estate ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",45
"46","—And for the benefit of themselves.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",46
"47","36513. But the people were not made the judges of their own benefit?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",47
"48","—They were not asked in the first place.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",48
"49","36514. What I want to arrive at is this, the people were virtually and substantially removed for the benefit of the estate, in order that this sheep farm, or some other part of the estate, might be more profitably administered and held ; in removing the people did the proprietor, in consideration of their number and poverty, and the difficulty of obtaining other places, make them any allowance or gratuity ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",49
"50","—Not to my knowledge.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",50
"51","36515. Do you know what became of them at all ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",51
"52","—Some of them removed to Glasgow and other centres of industry, and some of them removed to the village here.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",52
"53","36516. You say the people were partly removed for their own benefit, in order that they might become more industrious, or have a profitable employment m the future, did the proprietor pursue these people with any",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",53
"54","care in order to assist them in their future amelioration ? ",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",54
"55","—I am not aware.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",55
"56","36517. Those that settled here in the village, how were they dealt with ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",56
"57","—There was abundance of employment for them.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",57
"58","36518. What was the nature of the employment given them at that time?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",58
"59","—I understand Mr Smith, Ardtornish, employed every man he could get in the neighbourhood.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",59
"60","36519. They wars maintained by the assistance of a neighbouring proprietor ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",60
"61","—They were getting work from him, if they did not get it upon the property.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",61
"62","36520. With reference to the peat, it is stated, I have no doubt correctly, that they were not prevented cutting peats, but prevented cutting sods and spoiling the surface of the ground; have the people now convenient access to the fuel here ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",62
"63","—Yes, as much as they ever had.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",63
"64","36521. Do they make any payment, or do they cut them freely?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",64
"65","—They make no payment, but there is very little peat used now.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",65
"66","36522. It is stated that workmen's houses have been rebuilt upon the place. We heard to-day something of the rents paid for houses here. What are these new houses which were rebuilt, do they belong to the class of thatched houses or are they slated ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",66
"67","—These are not houses in the village, but houses used by shepherds and ploughman living on the property.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",67
"68","36523. The houses which have been rebuilt here were not rebuilt for the benefit of the class of persons evicted, but for the benefit of the dependants of the sheep farmers ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",68
"69","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",69
"70","36524. Bat there are a good number of cottages here, and some decent cottages ; have they not been rebuilt of late years ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",70
"71","—No, there has been no house built in the village for several years.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",71
"72","36525-6. Are you acquainted with the rents which are taken in the village here on the part of the proprietor or feuars ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",72
"73","—From 25s. in the village, to £3, I think.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",73
"74","36527. A pretty good cottage with two rooms and closet we were told would be rented for about £3, that would be a superior class ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",74
"75","—There is no superior class in the village.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",75
"76","36528. You mean there is no superior class of cottage in the village ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",76
"77","—No.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",77
"78","36529. But if there is a good substantial house with two rooms and closet, compared with the cottages we have been in the habit of seeing, that might be called almost a superior house ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",78
"79","—The most of the thatched houses in the village are just one apartment, and are rented at 25s. to 30s. a year.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",79
"80","36530. By one apartment do you mean really one room or a room divided by some sort of partition Ì",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",80
"81","—Just one room.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",81
"82","36531. Are there many families living in a house really of one room ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",82
"83","—One family.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",83
"84","36532. But is it a common thing?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",84
"85","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",85
"86","36533. Without a loft over the room ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",86
"87","—Without a loft.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",87
"88","36534. It was also stated to-day that there were in some houses single rooms let to families; are you aware of any house in which there is more than one family living in a room?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",88
"89","—No; I know some of the villagers at present have lodgers.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",89
"90","36535. They take in lodgers ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",90
"91","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",91
"92","36536. Would they take in lodgers in a single room ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",92
"93","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",93
"94","36537. You mean that a family occupying a single room take in lodgers besides ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",94
"95","—I believe some of them do.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",95
"96","36538. Have you any idea what they charge ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",96
"97","—No, I never needed to inquire.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",97
"98","36539. These are not, I suppose, houses belonging to the estate?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",98
"99","—Yes, but we have nothing to do with them doing that.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",99
"100","36540. Is there any supervision or estate regulation about taking in lodgers ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",100
"101","—No.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",101
"102","36541. We heard to-day that as much as £ 3 was given per annum for a single room ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",102
"103","—In one of the slated houses.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",103
"104","36542. But that was not stated to be on the estate?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",104
"105","—The trustees bought it ; it was in the market, and the trustees bought it.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",105
"106","36543. And hold it ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",106
"107","— Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",107
"108","36544. Without any control as to the number of persons or families occupying it ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",108
"109","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",109
"110","36545. Turning to a more agreeable subject; would you tell us about the pier which has been constructed at an expense of £3000? Constructed by the proprietor?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",110
"111","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",111
"112","36546. And, with reference to the class of persons employed in building, it gave, I suppose, employment to the local people ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",112
"113","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",113
"114","36547. As well as to skilled labour ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",114
"115","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",115
"116","36548. With what view was this large outlay particularly made—what trade is it to serve ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",116
"117","—It was a great disadvantage shipping the stock of this district. It had to be travelled to Corran.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",117
"118","36549. Then it has reference to general trade, export and import, not particularly to fishing ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",118
"119","—There are no fishermen living here ; the people never devoted any of their attention to fishing.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",119
"120","36550. There are charges taken at the pier?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",120
"121","—Yes, by sanction of the Board of Trade.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",121
"122","36551. Is there any hope that there will be a remunerative return for this large outlay ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",122
"123","—We look to that in the way of developing the estate, and if feus are taken up it will help to give a return for the money. The pier has been let for three years, and it gives about 2 per cent, of a return.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",123
"124","36552. And with the hope of a better return ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",124
"125","—I should hope so.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",125
"126","36553. What is chiefly exported from here—did you say stock?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",126
"127","—Stock and wool.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",127
"128","36554. Cattle ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",128
"129","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",129
"130","36555.  And increasing ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",130
"131","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",131
"132","36556. You mentioned roads; have there been roads created in the vicinity and on the estate at the expense of the proprietor ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",132
"133","—Yes, there was a road made to the pier at an expense of about £700.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",133
"134","36557. Available for the general use of the people?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",134
"135","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",135
"136","36558. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",136
"137","—You mentioned a comprisement book in which there was entered the value of the houses occupied by the crofters who were leaving ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",137
"138","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",138
"139","36559. Was that value entered in the view of giving them compensation if they improved their houses as well as of making them keep them up to the point ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",139
"140","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",140
"141","36560. Do you know if they ever got any compensation for improving their houses—do the books show it ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",141
"142","—The books show that very rarely, if ever. I do not recollect of an addition to the value of a place which had",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",142
"143","been made during the holding —to the house; a few shillings generally for a broken window or injured door.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",143
"144","36561. Were the houses valued when the people went away?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",144
"145","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",145
"146","36562. And the value compared with the entries in the comprisement book ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",146
"147","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",147
"148","36563. Do you know how they stood ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",148
"149","—The comprisement book was in the management of the former proprietor.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",149
"150","36564. And how did the valuations stand when the parties went away—were they less or more?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",150
"151","—They averaged from £7 to £10.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",151
"152","36565. But compared with the entries in the comprisement book, did the valuations vary at all at the time when the people were removed ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",152
"153","—I said they averaged from £7 to £ 10 in the comprisement book.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",153
"154","36566. Is that the old value taken over from the old proprietor or the entry made at the time of the removal ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",154
"155","—The old proprietor.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",155
"156","36567. They were valued at the time of the people's removal again?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",156
"157","—No such system was carried out by the present proprietor. But that was to show that the houses entirely belonged to the proprietor, even in the time of the firmer proprietor. There is another thing I wish to state,",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",157
"158","that wherever there is labour required for a property, crofter labour is of less value than the labour of parties living solely by week's wages, for this reason, that at the time their services are of the most value to the ",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",158
"159","employer they require to leave to go to attend to their own crofts ; it makes an immense difference to an employer of labour that he can command the labour at the time when it is of most value for his purposes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",159
"160","And another thing, within the last twenty or thirty years there has been so much improvement made in working land with regard to even cutting hay or corn, or gathering it in, with horse rakes and so on, that the great advantage is to economise hand labour and make use of implements to lessen the cost as far as possible of working the land.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",160
"161","36568. Professor Mackinnon.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",161
"162","—How long was the estate in the hands of the present family before these clearances were made ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",162
"163","—It was bought in 1863, and they left in 1866.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",163
"164","36569. And even although the people remained on the estate, there was no work carried on by the proprietor at the time to occupy them ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",164
"165","—I cannot speak of what work was carried on.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",165
"166","36570. Has your statement that the labour of a common labourer is of more value than the labour of a crofter, any point with reference to the administration of the estate ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",166
"167","—I am stating what I find in my experience :n working here and the labour I employ.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",167
"168","36571. I wanted to know whether it had reference to the past?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",168
"169","—No.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",169
"170","36572. It did not enter as part of the theory of clearing the crofters out?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",170
"171","—I am not concerned with that, and cannot state anything connected with it.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",171
"172","36573. But as matter of fact, there was.little or no work to employ these men ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",172
"173","—They could not have been in want of work, for there is no party who has lived in that village for, I may say, thirty years that ever needs to lose a day's work.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",173
"174","36574. From the proprietor of the estate?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",174
"175","—Of this estate or the adjoining estate. You perhaps may not understand sufficiently that there are no houses except a few that were built by Mr Smith from which he could get his labour except from this side of the loch.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",175
"176","36575. The people who were removed from this estate, those of them that remained in this place,—was there after they were removed, in the years immediately succeeding, work provided for them on the estate itself?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",176
"177","—I cannot state anything about that.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",177
"178","36576. Do you know the amount of work which was being carried on on the estate at the time ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",178
"179","—I cannot say; I was not acquainted with the estate.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",179
"180","36577. So far as you know then, they might or might not be employed upon the estate ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",180
"181","—They might.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",181
"182","36578. You stated that the places from which they were removed are paying hundreds of pounds of rent now more than they were before; are you able to give us the rents of the dispossessed crofters ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",182
"183","—You will find it in the valuation roll for 1865.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",183
"184","36579. You are not able to give it ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",184
"185","—I could get it from the valuation roll.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",185
"186","36580. And was it after making a comparison between that and the actual rent paid by this ground now that you made the statement ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",186
"187","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",187
"188","36581. It is paying now hundreds of pounds more?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",188
"189","—Yes, about £300.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",189
"190","36582. Have you any idea of the rent paid before?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",190
"191","—About £2130. ",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",191
"192","36583. And it is paying now £300 more?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",192
"193","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",193
"194","36584. That is 27 per cent, or so in seventeen years; do you think the rents of the large farms has not increased above 26 or 27 per cent. ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",194
"195","—Perhaps they may, and perhaps they have increased to an extent that they have not been paying the occupants, as I know has been too often the case within the last ten or twelve years.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",195
"196","36585. Do you think it would be unreasonable that, had the place been under crofters for the last seventeen years, the £300 additional might not have been realised from them ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",196
"197","—I cannot say what improvements they might have made upon it within that time that would have raised it. It is merely a supposition one could make.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",197
"198","36586. You have no idea of the amount of money spent upon the ground, with buildings and everything else, within the last seventeen years?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",198
"199","—No.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",199
"200","36587. And you are not able to form an opinion whether, if the same amount of money was spent upon the ground, and if left in the hands of the crofters, it might not fairly have been expected to yield £300 more rent than seventeen years ago ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",200
"201","—No, I cannot say. There is one thing I can say, the stock is of much more value now than it was then.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",201
"202","36588. Supposing that the same amount of money was spent upon it under a crofter population as was spent upon it within the last seventeen years, buildings, drains, and everything else, would it have been unreasonable to look for £300 of rise on a rent of £1100?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",202
"203","—I cannot form an opinion upon that.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",203
"204","36589. What was your reason for saying that the ground now was worth £300 more ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",204
"205","—The statement said that the ground was in a worse state now than then.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",205
"206","36590. You don't know the general rise of rent in that number of years ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",206
"207","—No.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",207
"208","36591. Of the one-roomed houses in the village some belonged to the estate and some to feuars ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",208
"209","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",209
"210","36592. And houses of one apartment are let by the estate and by feuars ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",210
"211","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",211
"212","36593. And in some of those let by the estate, a family who has only one apartment is allowed to sublet to a lodger ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",212
"213","—No restriction.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",213
"214","36594. Is there any great competition for those one-roomed houses when one of them becomes vacant ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",214
"215","—I think there is a demand for rooms in a slated house much more than in a thatched house. Parties always ask whether they can get a room in a slated house.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",215
"216","36595. With respect to houses which the crofters possessed, you stated that in the comprisement book they were entered at from £7 to £10 when the estate was bought ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",216
"217","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",217
"218","36596. I suppose the estate was throughout in the hands of the proprietor between this time and the dispossession —that there was no change of tenant in auy of these places ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",218
"219","—I cannot say as to that.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",219
"220","36597. You don't know of a second value being put upon a house?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",220
"221","—No.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",221
"222","36598. Was the tenant taken bound to keep up the house always ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",222
"223","—Yes, he had to leave it in the same condition that he got it—pay the depreciation of it.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",223
"224","36599. Of that thatched house?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",224
"225","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",225
"226","36600. Built without lime ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",226
"227","—I am talking about the things conducted by the former proprietor, not under the present management.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",227
"228","36601. But were these arrangements practicable?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",228
"229","—Their houses are very difficult to keep up.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",229
"230","36602. Could a man keep up without depreciation a thatched house of dry stone walls ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",230
"231","—It is quite possible to keep it up, if he bestowed enough of labour upon it.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",231
"232","36603. So that it would never grow old or fall ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",232
"233","—Well, if he required wood for the support of it they would require to renew it. ",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",233
"234","36604 Would it not require sometimes to be rebuilt ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",234
"235","—I never heard of them having been rebuilt. ",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",235
"236","36605. Perhaps because you had experience for only three years?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",236
"237","—I never heard of them being rebuilt when in the hands of the former proprietor, and I have looked over the comprisement book for thirty or forty years.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",237
"238","36606. Do you think it would have been entered ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",238
"239","—Yes, he was a very particular man—even a broken window was entered.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",239
"240","36607. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",240
"241","—Would you tell us how long the estate is to remain in trust ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",241
"242","—I think that is a question no person has anything to do with",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",242
"243","36608. My object is with regard to a resident proprietor; that is more advantageous than for it to be in the hand of trustees ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",243
"244","—The proprietor is resident—the principal proprietrix is resident. We are managing the estate for the beneficiaries, and they live here.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",244
"245","36609. The proprietrix is living here?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",245
"246","—One of the proprietresses.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",246
"247","36610. It does not appear who she is, that is why I ask?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",247
"248","—The trustees are the proprietors.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",248
"249","36611. You do not feel at liberty to mention how long it will be under trust ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",249
"250","—How can I tell the thing I don't know, and no one in the world knows ? It depends upon contingencies.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",250
"251","36612. You have given us a full and frank statement about the estate so far as you know it; have you ever heard the statement made with regard to property, ' I can do what I like with my own’ ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",251
"252","—Yes, but I don't believe that.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",252
"253","36613. Have you heard the other statement that property has its duties as well as its rights?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",253
"254","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",254
"255","36614. And which of these do you go upon?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",255
"256","—Property has its duties as well as its rights.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",256
"257","36615. I may take it for granted in this case that the rights of property were exercised when these people were put away?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",257
"258","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",258
"259","36616. Take the alternative now; what in the nature of duty was done by the estate for those people?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",259
"260","—I tell you I can give no information about it further than I have done.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",260
"261","36617. Is there any use in beating about the bush; is it not the fact that those people were removed solely and entirely because they were in the way of sheep ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",261
"262","—Certainly not.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",262
"263","36618. If not, what other reason was there?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",263
"264","—It would have entailed very considerable expenditure upon the proprietor to have built houses and put up fencing to have carried out any system of farming.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",264
"265","36619. That is what I say, the people were in the way. The proprietrix did not choose to spend that money, and therefore they must go and make room for the sheep; is not that so ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",265
"266","—I have given you all the facts I can.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",266
"267","36620. You stated, in answer to his Lordship in the chair, that it was to some extent for the benefit of the people themselves, that they might be more regular and more industrious in their work ; might I ask you what particular occupation in the world was pointed at by those in charge of the estate at the time that those people should turn their attention to ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",267
"268","—I cannot give you information that I do not possess myself.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",268
"269","36621. If the estate wished to benefit them and turn them into fishermen, did they provide them with any accommodation to pursue that calling, or did they give them anything to do whereby they could exist",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",269
"270","upon the estate ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",270
"271","—I do not understand how you are continually putting questions to me which I cannot answer. I do not possess the information.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",271
"272","36622. I do not wish to press you unduly, but you yourself have volunteered to come forward and give explanations ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",272
"273","—And I have given you all the explanations I possibly can.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",273
"274","36623. But I am afraid you must answer some questions. If you cannot answer them that is enough. Practically, was not the effect of the removal of those people off the estate to relieve the estate of their support and maintenance in all time coming?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",274
"275","—It would not have been a burden upon the estate any more than upon the rest of the parish.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",275
"276","36624. Is that your answer to my question ? If you find a person go on some years following a certain profession, the pursuit of agriculture in their own way, and you of a sudden put a stop to that which they have been accustomed to, what is the result with these people ; can they at one moment turn their attention to another profession? ",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",276
"277","—I was not aware those crofters had a profession.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",277
"278","36625. Had not they the profession of agriculture ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",278
"279","—I was not aware they had land in their possession except a garden and a cow's grass. I don't know what profession you call that.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",279
"280","36626. They said themselves they were happy and contented with their lot and made a living ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",280
"281","—They were always that, and yet periodically they were in great destitution, and every now and again, as Dr Macleod told me himself, subscriptions had to be got up to assist them.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",281
"282","36627. And that being the case, the estate thought the best thing for them would be to deprive them of what they had ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",282
"283","—I cannot say what the proprietor then thought. I am merely giving you the information I have. I cannot state what the proprietor thought when I was not made aware of it.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",283
"284","36628. The rental of the estate has increased, has it not ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",284
"285","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",285
"286","36629. The people have been swept away, is that not so ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",286
"287","—I hear.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",287
"288","36630. The people have been swept away ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",288
"289","—There is some of them in existence yet; you have seen them.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",289
"290","36631. They have been swept off the estate?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",290
"291","—There are some of them hailing from Lochaline village yet. You have had delegates here living in that village ; they are there yet.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",291
"292","36632. Living in that village?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",292
"293","—I don't know where you have swept them away to, but there are some of them there still.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",293
"294","36633. Was it for the benefit of the crofter people that the pier was built ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",294
"295","—It is for the benefit of the whole district. It was urgently called for.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",295
"296","36634. By the owners of sheep and cattle?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",296
"297","—By any party who had to land in a small boat.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",297
"298","36635. Was not it in reality just a mere pecuniary speculation for the estate ; you thought you might get feus let, and draw dues ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",298
"299","—If you think it a good speculation, 2 per cent, for some years, I don't know, but I believe that ultimately it will be advantageous both for the estate and district.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",299
"300","36636. Have you been getting any feus taken off?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",300
"301","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",301
"302","36637. What rate do you charge ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",302
"303","—Various rates.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",303
"304","36638. Is it per acre or foot ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",304
"305","—There is no sum stated ; no hard and fast line.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",305
"306","36639. You have heard some of the delegates state that they would like to get some of the land back ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",306
"307","—Every one does that.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",307
"308","36640. Have you thought of the propriety of indulging them in any way in that light ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",308
"309","—So far as I have got the management of the property, I have to carry out the system that is being carried out.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",309
"310","36641. That is, matters must be carried out on the policy previously laid down ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",310
"311","—I could not think of encumbering the estate by raising money that might not prove remunerative, and for which trustees might be called in question. Trustees cannot act in the same way as an individual proprietor.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",311
"312","36642. That is exactly why I wanted to know how long the trust might subsist ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",312
"313","—Well, if you or any other gentleman were to offer a good price for the property, we might bring the trust to a termination before long.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",313
"314","36643. It can be sold?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",314
"315","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",315
"316","36644. You stated you had some conversation with the late Dr Macleod, minister of the parish, in regard to the people ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",316
"317","—Yes.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",317
"318","36645. How long is it since you have been resident here ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",318
"319","—Two years ; but I have been acquainted with the district for a good many years.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",319
"320","36646. Did Dr Macleod ever remonstrate or express any regret that the people generally in this parish had been removed ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",320
"321","—All ministers must take an interest in keeping their flocks together.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",321
"322","36647. I am afraid the flocks you look after are not men ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",322
"323","—I think I take as much interest in my workpeople as airy farmer or proprietor has ever done.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",323
"324","36648. Are the quarries likely to give steady employment to the workpeople?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",324
"325","—They certainly are, and I hope they will be developed and give employment to a great many more.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",325
"326","36649. How long are these open ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",326
"327","—This season.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",327
"328","36650. Do they look as if they were to carry out well ?",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",328
"329","—Yes ; it is the best and only stone in the district.",603,"William Henderson Hardie","Argyll, Lochaline",329
