"1","SAMUEL ANDERSON, Crofter formerly Fisherman, Croagreen, Ollabcrry, (63)—examined.",369,"Samuel Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",1
"2","21013. The Chairman.",369,"Samuel Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",2
"3","—What statement have you to make?",369,"Samuel Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",3
"4","—About seventy years ago my father enclosed a piece of hill pasture about ten acres called the Croagreen, on the Ollaberry estate. He built a house on it, and cultivated a part of it, and paid a yearly rent of £2, 10s. up to about 1850, when the property was bought by Mr Gideon Anderson. Since then I have built new dykes, enclosing about two acres more of hill pasture. I cultivated more land, and repaired the house. My rent was then raised to £1 , 15s. This is what I have to complain of; instead of being paid for improvements, I get to pay for my own outlay.",369,"Samuel Anderson","Shetland, Hillswick",4
