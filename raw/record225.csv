"1","JOHN MACDONALD, Newton, Factor on the Estate of North Uist (56)—examined",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",1
"2","12743. The Chairman.—Have you a farm ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",2
"3","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",3
"4","12744. Professor Mackinnon.—How long have you had charge of this property as factor ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",4
"5","—Since Sir John Orde purchased it at Whitsunday 1855.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",5
"6","12745. That is twenty-eight years ago ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",6
"7","—Yes, but I was only sub-factor at first.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",7
"8","12746. But you have been upon this property continuously since that time ?—I was born and brought up on the estate. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",8
"9","12747. You were born here ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",9
"10","—Yes, on this side of the island.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",10
"11","12748. What is the total rent of the island?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",11
"12","—£4872, 16s. 10d.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",12
"13","12749. Do you think you would be able to say iu a rough way to what extent that rental is made up from large holdings, from crofters, and from cottars?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",13
"14","—To the best of my recollection, the crofters pay £1900 of the rent.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",14
"15","12750. Of course the rents of these crofters vary considerably among themselves ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",15
"16","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",16
"17","12751. How high do some of them go ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",17
"18","—There are very few as high as £10.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",18
"19","12752. And some of them go as low as what ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",19
"20","—£1 or 25s. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",20
"21","12753. Then there is a large number of cottars who don't pay any rent?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",21
"22","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",22
"23","12754. Do they pay to the proprietor, or are they charged any rent ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",23
"24","—They have been charged rent, aud a few of them pay, but not many. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",24
"25","12755. Does that rent cover any stock they may have?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",25
"26","—No; it is merely for the stance of the house, and for the privilege of fuel.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",26
"27","12756. You heard the complaint of the crofters to-day, that not merely were those cottars squatted there, but that they had some stock for which they paid nothing to them, which the crofters consider a hardship and a grievance. Is there any regulation upon the estate to prevent such a practice as that ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",27
"28","—We do not tolerate it when we can prevent it, but it is the doing of the tenants themselves and not of the proprietor.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",28
"29","12757. Taking the small holdings upon the average, you have heard the statements of the people to-day, that while the rents were on the whole higher than they could have wished, still their chief complaint was not so much the rent as the smallness of the croft. From your well-known knowledge of what rents for crofts ought to be in such a place as this, do you consider the crofts upon this estate over-rented as compared with other estates more or less similar?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",29
"30","—I believe they are lower.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",30
"31","12758. You would agree in the main, however, with the statements of the crofters that it would be greatly to their advantage if their crofts were larger than they are ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",31
"32","—Yes, it would be to the thrifty crofters.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",32
"33","12759. There was a very important statement made to us, and I should like to know in your experience whether those who are in arrear are chiefly from the smaller class of crofters or from those who have better",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",33
"34","crofts and pay higher rents?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",34
"35","—They are principally from the smaller holdings.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",35
"36","12760. I suppose if it could be conveniently done you would be very glad to see the crofts of the thrifty crofters enlarged ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",36
"37","—I would.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",37
"38","12761. Then in a township with enlarged crofts of that sort you would of course fence off the whole pasture from the arable ground ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",38
"39","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",39
"40","12762. Would you have the stock managed accordiug to the club system upon the hill pasture, or each one looking after his own ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",40
"41","—The club system would answer better if they could winter their hoggs, but the custom on this island is to winter the hoggs in their houses, and the club system would not suit very well.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",41
"42","12763. Then, as to the arable ground, would you consider it an advantage that each separate croft should be fenced off if the crofts were a little larger than they are ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",42
"43","—That would depend upon whose expense it was to be done at.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",43
"44","12764. Apart from that, would it be an advantage ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",44
"45","—It would be an advantage to have a ring fence round each township.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",45
"46","12765. Would you not think it necessary that there should be a separate fence round the arable ground on each croft ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",46
"47","—No doubt, every fence is au advantage.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",47
"48","12766. At present I suppose the arable ground is free to the stock of the whole place during the winter? —Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",48
"49","12767. And in that way it is not so easy to put any portion of it under grass ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",49
"50","—No. That is partly the reason why grass seeds are not sown by the crofters.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",50
"51","12768. That is the chief reason?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",51
"52","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",52
"53","12769. But the great difficulty of putting up fences would be the expenses?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",53
"54","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",54
"55","12770. I think it was stated upon your authority that there were two or three townships in which not only the whole of the pasture but the arable land was on the club system ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",55
"56","—Yes, run-rig.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",56
"57","12771. It was stated as one advantage of that system that there was not the same tendency to overcrowding, but rather that the neighbours would prevent overcrowding if possible. Is there any disadvantage, however in the way of cultivation?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",57
"58","—There is no disadvantage in the way of cultivation ; but there is this disadvantage in the case of squatting, that if you wanted to turn out a squatter you would have to summon the whole tenants of the farm, because you don't know who owns the grouud on which he squats.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",58
"59","12772. As matter of fact, are those places that are cultivated in that way, where one has the ground for a year and his neighbour has it for another year, and so on, as weU cultivated as where every one has his own?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",59
"60","—I believe they are better. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",60
"61","12773. It is good for the lazy man, but is it good for the thrifty man ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",61
"62","—Yes, the thrifty man carries the lazy man with him.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",62
"63","12774. Then you think it would be an advantage ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",63
"64","—In a small township, but not in a large township. If you have only six you can get these pieces equally divided, but if you divide it among twenty you can hardly get them of equal value.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",64
"65","12775. And when the holdings are very small, you would consider it better the other way ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",65
"66","—They are the most tidy we have on the estate.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",66
"67","12776. And part of that you attribute to the mode of cultivation ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",67
"68","—Yes, I think so. There are various other causes, of course; the farms are moderately rented.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",68
"69","12777. Having been born and brought up on this estate, I suppose you had and always have had plenty opportunity of knowing not only about the condition of the people, but about their ways, habits, and mode of life. Do you agree generally with the statements they make themselves that they were more comfortably off before the potato disease than they are now ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",69
"70","—I concur with Mr Macrae's statement.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",70
"71","12778. His statement was that they now live less substantially, but more extravagantly—and that perhaps there was more of rude comfort and less finery formerly ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",71
"72","—There was not the facility which there is now of sending their produce away to market, which is a great inducement to send away things that were useful to them in those days. For instance, they could not send sheep away in those days. There was no steam communication. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",72
"73","12779. And you are quite certain that the crofting population of North Uist in those days actually ate more mutton than they do now ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",73
"74","—Yes, that is my belief.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",74
"75","12780. Of course, there was more milk and less tea ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",75
"76","—Less tea, no doubt.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",76
"77","12781. They were less finely clothed, but were they comfortably clothed in those days ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",77
"78","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",78
"79","12782. About as comfortably as now-a-days, but less expensively ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",79
"80","—Yes, they were clothed in clothes of their own making.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",80
"81","12783. With respect to their general habits now and then, are the people as hearty and cheerful as they were then ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",81
"82","—I am sure that I see no difference. Of course, this is not a cheerful year, but previous to this year I could see no difference.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",82
"83","12784. At gatherings and merry makings, is there as much singing and amusement as ever there was ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",83
"84","—No, I do not suppose there is.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",84
"85","12785. Is there any special cause for that ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",85
"86","—Well, the evidence which you have been taking in other places would bear the same way here.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",86
"87","12786. It was stated in some places that some of the clergy discouraged amusements of that sort ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",87
"88","—I believe it is the case.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",88
"89","12787. Have you any local bards of note now ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",89
"90","—No. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",90
"91","12788. Have you been a member of the school board since the introduction of the new Act ?—Yes",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",91
"92","12789. And you were perfectly acquainted with the education of the people long before that ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",92
"93","—Yes. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",93
"94","12790. I suppose there is no doubt that the common school education of the people of the place has improved very much within the last forty years ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",94
"95","—Yes, very much improved indeed.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",95
"96","12791. And within the last ten years it has still more improved?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",96
"97","—Still more improved.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",97
"98","12792. I suppose, were it not for this voluntary school first kept up by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, and now by the committee of the Free Church, at Boreray, you would feel almost bound to erect a school at Boreray ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",98
"99","—Yes, I must confess it was an error of the school board that we mentioned another place instead of Boreray. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",99
"100","12793. There was a statement made by some of the people here with respect to teaching the children Gaelic. Has the school board any educational views on that question? Other things being equal, would they",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",100
"101","consider that an advantage in the education of the children1?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",101
"102","—I do not think they would.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",102
"103","12794. The great object is to endeavour to get as much English as possible ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",103
"104","—As much English as possible.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",104
"105","12795. And the belief of the board is that anything done in the way of teaching the children Gaelic rather stands in the way of teaching English ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",105
"106","—Well, if the teacher had plenty of time it would not do the children any harm to be taught their native language.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",106
"107","12796. Is there any complaint of late years, and under the new system that clever boys are not able to make their way so well as they used to do, when perhaps the teacher gave them more time than he gave to the rest of the children of the school ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",107
"108","—The teachers cannot devote as much time to technical subjects now as they could before, because when I",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",108
"109","attended school there were no small children at all. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",109
"110","12797. And of course the big boys, especially if clever, got all the time ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",110
"111","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",111
"112","12798. And there was a large number of clever boys who went from Uist and made their way in the world? —Yes, a great many. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",112
"113","12799. Of course, you would consider that a great advantage to the general community as well as to Uist? —Of course it was.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",113
"114","12800. Do you think of late years the supply of good scholars who go away from the country has been kept up, or is it going back under the new system ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",114
"115","—Under the new system they are not so far advanced, but we have as many clever boys who can earn bursaries. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",115
"116","12801. But they are not able to get the same amount of attention in school, because of the strain upon the teachers in supplying common school education to the whole people ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",116
"117","—That is what I say.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",117
"118","12802. Would you consider it a very great advantage if both could be kept up ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",118
"119","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",119
"120","12803. Mr Cameron.—It was stated by a previous witness, and also referred to by Mr Macrae, that turnips were not sown here for fear of people stealing them. Have you had any experience of that, or do you share in the apprehension of that delegate ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",120
"121","—Foolish boys may take a turnip, but the complaint of the crofters used to be that if I compelled every crofter in the township to sow turnips it would be an advantage, and then if anybody lost everybody would lose. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",121
"122","12804. Is it not the custom of the crofters to sow turnips?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",122
"123","—No.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",123
"124","12805. Very few of them do that ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",124
"125","—Very few.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",125
"126","12806. But you would endeavour to encourage them to do so as much as possible?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",126
"127","—Certainly.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",127
"128","12807. Do all the crofters on this estate have sheep more or less?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",128
"129","—I am not aware of any that have not sheep.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",129
"130","12808. What class of sheep are they ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",130
"131","—Principally ewes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",131
"132","12809. Of the blackfaced breed?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",132
"133","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",133
"134","12810. Do they sell their wedder lambs?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",134
"135","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",135
"136","12811 And keep there ewe lambs?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",136
"137","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",137
"138","12812. Do they sell their slack ewes?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",138
"139","—Yes; they send them away, principally to Glasgow.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",139
"140","12813. How do they winter their young sheep?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",140
"141","—Most of their hoggs are wintered in the houses.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",141
"142","12814. Turnips then would be of considerable advantage to them in wintering those sheep if they grew a few? —Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",142
"143","12815. Have there been any cases lately of sheep stealing in the island ? ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",143
"144","—I cannot bring any case to my mind. There has not been a conviction for a great many years.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",144
"145","12816. You can corroborate the statement made by Mr Macrae that sheep stealing is of very rare occurrence?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",145
"146","—Very rare indeed.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",146
"147","12817. What hill pasture do the crofters of this estate possess?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",147
"148","—I cannot state it in acres, because I have only the Ordnance map on the 25 inch scale.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",148
"149","12818. Is it very considerable ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",149
"150","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",150
"151","12819. Does it lie adjacent to each township, or is there a great deal of it together in one patch ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",151
"152","—They do not keep their stock separate. This island is a roundish island, and their common is very much in the middle part of the island, and the whole tenantry have liberty to send their sheep in there.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",152
"153","12820. Do the crofts surround this common hill?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",153
"154","—On the one side.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",154
"155","12821. Where is the hill grazing of the other crofters who are not on the side of the hill ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",155
"156","—They extend all over the island from one end to the other.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",156
"157","12822. Is each hill grazing adjacent to the township whose sheep it pastures?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",157
"158","—Yes, I believe every tenant on the estate has grazing for twelve sheep.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",158
"159","12823. It has been stated that in former times the people did not require to buy food from the south, but now they do. Can you account for that at all ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",159
"160","—I remember when there was none brought into the country—when there was no meal sold except the produce of the country. In a great measure, I think it is due to the change of the seasons—the winter or spring weather goes so far into summer and the autumn weather goes into the winter.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",160
"161","12824. Does it not possibly happen that it pays the people better to rear more cattle and sheep, and with the produce of these cattle and sheep to buy meal in the south, rather than to grow it in a climate like this ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",161
"162","—It is principally grown now to provide fodder for cattle and horses, and they keep more cattle than they did in former times",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",162
"163","12825. And you agree with what was said, that the price of cattle is very much above what it was in former times ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",163
"164","—Very much indeed.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",164
"165","12826. Do you find it pays better to raise cattle, and with the produce of those cattle to buy meal in the south? ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",165
"166","—Yes, that is the general practice in the island.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",166
"167","12827. In the observation you made on the subject of the climate, do you attribute the fact that less corn is grown more to the change in climate than to the exhaustion of the soil ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",167
"168","—The produce is less.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",168
"169","12828. But we have heard a good deal about the soil being supposed to be exhausted by frequent cropping. Is that your belief and experience ? ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",169
"170","—Well, I can hardly speak on that subject, because there are some here whose grandfathers have been cultivating a piece of ground, and their great-grandfathers, and still in a good season I do not see any difference on the crop. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",170
"171","12829. Is the arable ground of the crofters sufficently large to enable them to give part of their land a rest occasionally?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",171
"172","—On most of the farms it is.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",172
"173","12830. You said they did not give it that rest in the shape of taking turnips. Do they do so in the shape of  laying down grass for two or three years ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",173
"174","—They do not lay down any grass seeds.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",174
"175","12831. Would that not be desirable ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",175
"176","—Very desirable indeed.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",176
"177","12832. It would require more fencing?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",177
"178","—It would require a great deal more fencing",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",178
"179","12833. Have you had any application on the part of the crofters that you should erect fences, and that they should pay interest ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",179
"180","—Yes, there is one application iu the meantime.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",180
"181","12834. Is the proprietor inclined to favour such applications?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",181
"182","—He is.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",182
"183","12835. And you would be inclined to recommend that fences should be erected at the proprietor's expense, if the tenant would pay the interest on the cost?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",183
"184","—Well, they prefer building them themselves to paying interest.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",184
"185","12836. Will you state the amount of school rates, poor rates, and road money payable in this island? —School rate, 3s.; parochial, rate, 2s. 7d.; road money, 7d.—making a total of 6s. 2d., divisible between landlord and tenant",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",185
"186","12837. I suppose those rates have increased very little of late?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",186
"187","—Yes, very little.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",187
"188","12838. You stated it was in contemplation to build a school on Boreray, and instead of that you built it on another island ?—Yes; it was a mistake on the part of the school board. They mentioned the one island instead of the other at the time of applying for the grant.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",188
"189","12839. Which island is it?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",189
"190","—Heiskar.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",190
"191","12840. Was there a ladies' school there?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",191
"192","—A Gaelic ladies' school.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",192
"193","12841. That was done away with?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",193
"194","—We have given them the use of the house, and they keep a teacher.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",194
"195","12842. How do you manage to keep a school in the island of Boreray? Was the teacher not withdrawn when the Education Act was passed ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",195
"196","—They have not withdrawn that yet.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",196
"197","12843. It was stated by Mr Macdonald, the factor in South Uist, that he attributed the want of milk which the people experienced now to their keeping fewer cows, in consequence of keeping too many horses. Is it your experience that the people here keep too many horses ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",197
"198","—When they exceed two horses they have too many, but they all require two horses. They have a long way to carry sea-weed, and again in spring they plough with a pair of ponies.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",198
"199","12844. Do they make much profit by selling young horses ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",199
"200","—They do now.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",200
"201","12845. What do they get for a young colt?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",201
"202","—Prices are low at present. I have seen a year-old fetch £17.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",202
"203","12846. Is there a good supply of stallions in the country?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",203
"204","—Sir John used to supply us. He sent us three.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",204
"205","12847. I suppose there are none of the old Highland ponies?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",205
"206","—They are dying out fast. The last I got was a Welsh pony, which I took from the Duke of Sutherland.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",206
"207","12848. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.—What will the average crofter be able to sell off his croft in a year—say a man who is paying £ 5 ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",207
"208","—The produce of his cattle, and if he keeps two mares instead of horses he must sell a colt every year.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",208
"209","12849. Of the value of £171",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",209
"210","—No; at the present time I should say that for a year-old a good average price would bo between £7 and £8. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",210
"211","12850. Could he sell one young animal—a stirk?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",211
"212","—Any crofter having four cows ought to be able to sell two every year. Some have four stirks, others have none, in a year.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",212
"213","12851. But could an average croftor sell two in a year?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",213
"214","—Yes, I think he could.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",214
"215","12852. What would be the value of them ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",215
"216","—Up to £7 each, the best of them—generally from £ 5 to £6.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",216
"217","12853. Then that is all he really could sell, because the corn produced is nothing at all ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",217
"218","—In favourable seasons they could sell more—that is, in the next year after a favourable season, because all their cows are in calf; but a season like this puts them back very much indeed.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",218
"219","12854. You said something which I considsr very heterodox about Gaelic. You speak Gaelic yourself? —Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",219
"220","12855. And have done so all your life?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",220
"221","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",221
"222","12856. You read it?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",222
"223","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",223
"224","12857. And write it ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",224
"225","—I cannot say I can write it well",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",225
"226","12858. You would not wish that you never had Gaelic?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",226
"227","—No, I would not.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",227
"228","12859. Then why is it that you discourage the teaching of it in schools, and therefore prevent Gaelic scholars from having that proper knowledge of the language which could be so easily given ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",228
"229","—Without an additional staff of teachers, it could not be done. It would take up too muchof their time.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",229
"230","12860. It is only a question of expense ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",230
"231","—It is only a question of expense.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",231
"232","12861. You would not go to the length of saying that Gaelic is of no importance in the Highlands ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",232
"233","—I believe the importance is getting less every day.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",233
"234","12862. You have stated that in your younger days no meal was brought into the country. You know that? —Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",234
"235","12863. And now a great deal is brought in ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",235
"236","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",236
"237","12864. How do you account for that? You have mentioned the weather, to some extent?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",237
"238","—The ground in some cases may be getting exhausted, but it is remarkable that ground which is not in grass produces the best crop of potatoes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",238
"239","12865. Will you say it is not to some extent in consequence of a great deal of land which was once under cultivation being now out of cultivation and under permanent pasture ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",239
"240","—I cannot say that, because all the holdings are of the same size as when I first remember. I myself am now obliged to give a six-course shift. I found that with a five-course shift the crops were not so good as they used to be, and I gave it up.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",240
"241","12866. For instance, in Sollas, you don't see so much land cultivated as there used to be ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",241
"242","—Oh, no.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",242
"243","12867. Then would you not attribute the greater necessity there is now to bring meal from the south to the fact that a good deal of land, which was once under cultivation by crofters at some period or other, is now under sheep ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",243
"244","—I cannot agree with that.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",244
"245","12868. How many acres do you suppose there are in North Uist that are under sheep and not crop?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",245
"246","—I cannot say. There are 75,000 acres in the whole island, but I cannot say how many are under sheep.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",246
"247","12869. Would there be 10,000 acres that were once under cultivation and are now out of cultivation, taking the most fertile parts of the north ? ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",247
"248","—No. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",248
"249","12270. Not so much as that?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",249
"250","—No, because the cultivated part bears but a small proportion to the grazing part of the land.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",250
"251","12871. But still you say that in your younger days, when the people were as numerous as they are now, they did not import corn, and it must have been grown on the island ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",251
"252","—But they have the same holdings that they had then, except the Loch Eport tenants. No grazing has been taken from them, and no part of their tillage land has been taken from them. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",252
"253","12872. Since when?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",253
"254","—Since 1855.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",254
"255","12873. But I am going back fifty years ago?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",255
"256","—I cannot speak of fifty years ago.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",256
"257","12874. I will put the question again. You said that when you were a young man there was no meal then imported into the island, and you have also stated that now a great deal of meal is imported into the island. Is it not one of the probable causes why meal is necessary to be imported into the country that a deal of land that in your younger days was turned over by the plough regularly is not now turned over by the plough ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",257
"258","—I attribute it to the seasons having changed, and to the ground being in some places exhausted. I do not see the bearing of the question at all, because the people have the same quantity of land now that they had then.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",258
"259","12875. Is there at this moment over the whole of North Uist as much land turned over by the plough every year as there was fifty years ago ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",259
"260","—No; since these clearances took place there could not be.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",260
"261","12876. How much was thrown out of cultivation by these clearances ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",261
"262","— I cannot say in acres.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",262
"263","12877. But there is a great deal ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",263
"264","—Yes.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",264
"265","12878. That being the case, surely if so many acres have been thrown out of cultivation, must it not follow that the produce of grain has decreased ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",265
"266","—No, not from that cause. A crofter who was a crofter fifty years ago has the same holding to-day. There has been nothing taken from that croft. His father and grandfather had it at the same size. He had plenty of grain in the days you speak of. He has the same amount of land to-day, but he has not the grain. ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",266
"267","12879. But I don't think we have found any man who is in the same spot and in the same circumstances as his father and grandfather ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",267
"268","—There are a great many here.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",268
"269","12880. The Chairman.—Since you have been in the management'of this estate have there been any evictions except on account of non-payment of rent ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",269
"270","—None at all. There has been no eviction in my time.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",270
"271","12881. Since the management came into your hands, has there been any diminution of the hill pasture of the small tenants ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",271
"272","—Not one foot; more has been added to it.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",272
"273","12882. Has there been any increase of rent in reference to the small tenants ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",273
"274","—Not one sixpence.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",274
"275","12883. Has there been any diminution of the same ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",275
"276","—No. Of course, burdens have largely increased in that time.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",276
"277","12884. Could there be in many cases land added to the crofters' holdings, both arable and hill pasture, without destroying the large farms, but leaving, the large farms still of tolerable area ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",277
"278","—Some of the farms of course might be reduced in size. There are only seventeen in the island paying above",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",278
"279","£30 of rent.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",279
"280","12885. You told us what has taken place during the period of your management, but looking back on all you have read and heard about the management of this island, do you think on reflection that the system of ",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",280
"281","evictions and consolidation into large farms was in those days carried too far, and do you regret it now ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",281
"282","—It may have been carried too far, but it was before my time.",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",282
"283","12886. You have not formed any decided opinion about that ?",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",283
"284","—No,",225,"John Macdonald","North Uist, Loch Eport",284
