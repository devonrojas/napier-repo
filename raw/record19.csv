"1","ALEXANDER LAMONT, Crofter, Keistle (59)—examined. ",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",1
"2","1196. The Chairman.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",2
"3","—Are you a fisherman?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",3
"4","—I am not a fisherman.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",4
"5","1197. How long have you been on your croft?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",5
"6","—For thirty-three years.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",6
"7","1198. Were you freely elected by the people here to be their delegate?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",7
"8","—Yes. I was born at Henisdale. When I was young I have seen seventeen crofters there in that Glen, and three of them had dauble shares. There was no school in the Glen at all. They were able to send their families to other places to give them education. ""Well, any of the rest here in the Glen could not do that, because they had single crofts and half crofts. But I think those who had a double proportion were able to send their families to give them education. I was removed from the place to another glen,—to Keistle yphere. I have seen that those who have double crofts are better off than those who have single crofts and half crofts. They are more able to pay their rents than those who have single or halfcrofts; and I think that would give peace to themselves and their proprietors, when they would have double shares. And I think, moreover, if people would have double shares, they would be more able to pay their rents than with single shares. It would be a bad year when their crufts would not be worth anything ; they would' have their stock to pay the proprietors ; and, as some of the other men were saying, if they had more land at a reasonable rent, the poor people would be far better off. When they could not raise crop they would have stock. When I came into the croft, the first rent I paid was £7, 17s. 6d. Corrie was alive at the time, and he was the factor then ; and I continued in that state for twenty years, paying to Corrie ; and my neighbours and myself were in use to go with their rent to Corrie. Well, Corrie died, and the proprietor who was factor to old Lord Macdonald (Tormore) came in, and the rent was raised, and the second year after Tormore came in my lot was £9. That was £1, 2s. 6d. of rise. There were fourteen tenants, who had fourteen shares; and there was another man, Peter Macdonald in Portree who had two shares. There were sixteen tenants in the place then, and when thatman died the low land he had was joined into Skerriuish farm, and we had the hill that he had, and he laid 15s. apiece on the fourteen, shares, and my lot was £9, 15s., and the rest was greater. It is a kind of a narrow strip we have of the hill, and we are surrounded with tacksmen on each side, and they are giving us very bad justice. The man who was at the march—William M'Leod in Scorrybreck—was very hard upon us, and we are obliged to pay more than £2 0 for poinding our sheep in one year, on the fourteen tenants.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",8
"9","1199. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",9
"10","—Had you a shepherd?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",10
"11","—Yes, we had a herd for the sheep, and we had another herd for the horses, and another herd for the stirks ; when this low land was joined into Skerriuish he raised 15s. on the fourteen shares for his hill, and that piece was put in the Skerrinish farm.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",11
"12","1200. Why was that piece of low land put into Skerriuish?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",12
"13","—I cannot tell you. It was not fair at all to take it from us.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",13
"14","1201. Was it offered to you?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",14
"15","—No; I was not at home at the time.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",15
"16","1202. Was it offered to the township? Was it offered to any of the tenants that are here? [Cries of ""No.""].",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",16
"17","—We stood out upon the factor —Mr Macdonald of Portree—that we would not pay the old rent because the land was taken from us; but it was Tormore who took it from us, and any alteration this factor made upon us was on our side. He took £ 5 of the rent down of this last rent we paid. We cannot blame him for that. He took £ 5 off the whole fourteen shares. Any alteration he made was on our side.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",17
"18","1203. Mr Cameron.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",18
"19","—You said that if you had double crofts, the people would be better able to pay their rent ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",19
"20","—That is my opinion.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",20
"21","1204. How do you propose to get double crofts without taking somebody else's from him ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",21
"22","—You cannot double them unless you would go into other places.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",22
"23","1205. You mean that by removing half the people you would be able to double the crofts of those left behind?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",23
"24","—No; to give more land at other places.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",24
"25","1206. How many crofts are there at your place?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",25
"26","—Fourteen.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",26
"27","1207. How would you propose to give twenty-eight crofts to those fourteen ? Suppose you had the power to do it, where would you get the land ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",27
"28","—You could not get it in that place.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",28
"29","1208. Then you would have to move the people, and give them new crofts? It would not be doubling the old crofts?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",29
"30","—No, you could not double the old crofts.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",30
"31","1209. Then, how would you set about it ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",31
"32","—Well, it is my opinion they could get land beside them—farms occupied by other people. There are plenty of tacks about them.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",32
"33","1210. Quite touching their crofts ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",33
"34","—Yes.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",34
"35","1211. You mean you could take a slice out of a farm, and add it to each croft all the way along ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",35
"36","—Yes, if the people would get it in other places. If the tenants would have double shares they would be better off. That is what I mean.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",36
"37","1212. Professor Mackinnon.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",37
"38","—Have you a double share yourself?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",38

"40","1213.Mr Cameron .",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",40
"41","—Where is the land you think might be added to the crofts? What farms adjoin Keistle ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",41
"42","—Scorrybreck and Skerrinish.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",42
"43","1214. Which is the nearest?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",43
"44","—Glenhaultin and Skerrinish.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",44
"45","1215. Would that make more arable land or only pasture ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",45
"46","—Arable land.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",46
"47","1216. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",47
"48","—What was the reason given for raising the rent from £7, 17s. 6d. to £9?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",48

"52","1218. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",52
"53","—Did you just get notice from the factor that the rent was to be raised ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",53
"54","—Yes, we got a writ from him that he was going to raise the rent.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",54
"55","1219. Did some of you go down to the factor and protest against it ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",55
"56","— We had to pay the rent.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",56
"57","1220. Did you say anything against it",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",57
"58","—No.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",58

"61","1222. Why did you not object to the rent being raised ? Didn't you say a word about it ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",61

"63","1223. Professor Mackinnon.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",63
"64","—What is your present actual rent? What did you pay last Martinmas ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",64

"69","—About 40 head of sheep.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",69
"70","1226. And you think that just about as much again would make a comfortable croft ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",70
"71","—Yes, that is what I think.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",71
"72","1227. And just about as much again of rent?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",72
"73","—No, a reasonable rent.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",73
"74","1228. What would you call a reasonable rent for a croft twice the size of your own ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",74
"75","—The thing that I have seen was that those who had two crofts when I was young were paying £12 for the two crofts.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",75
"76","1229. And you would think that a fair rent?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",76

"84","1232. Why don't you poind them ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",84

"89","—A few, but never many of them.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",89
"90","1235. Why didn't you catch them?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",90

"92","1236. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",92
"93","—Are you quite sure you paid £20 and that it was not given back to you ?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",93

"105","1241. Was it his arable ground that was joined to the neighbouring farm?",19,"Alexander Lamont","Skye, Skeabost",105
