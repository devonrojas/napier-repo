"5","26213. Were you elected a delegate?",443,"Alexander Morrison","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",5
"6","—Yes.",443,"Alexander Morrison","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",6
"7","26214. From Durness?",443,"Alexander Morrison","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",7
"8","—From Sangobeg.",443,"Alexander Morrison","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",8
"9","26215. Were there many people present when you were elected?",443,"Alexander Morrison","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",9
"10","—The whole town—thirty or forty of them altogether.",443,"Alexander Morrison","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",10
"11","26216. Have you a written statement on behalf of these people?",443,"Alexander Morrison","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",11
"12","—Ithink there is one with Rev. Mr Ross if he comes round.",443,"Alexander Morrison","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",12
"13","26217. What have you to say on behalf of the people?",443,"Alexander Morrison","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",13
"14","—I have been forty years at Sangobeg. There were tenants upon the whole of our ground, and Rispond was a fishing port. There were twenty-five families removed to make a sheep farm. Twelve of them were sent in to Sangobeg. There are now twelve families in Sangobeg, and there were only six before the change was made. We are deprived of the privileges of sea and land. The seaport is taken from us; it is two miles for the nearest fisherman. We fish for every kind of fish that is needed, and we don't get the proper use of them, because we have no proper means of conveying them to the market. The lobsters die before they reach the market. The lobsters require to go alive to the market, and we are sixty miles from the nearest railway station. There may be a merchant at hand for the fish which are brought ashore who will give an offer for what he wants himself, but the rest are left in our hands. If we had a pier, a telegraph station, a doctor, and some more of the land which has been taken from us, we think we might get through as our forefathers did. We are without any privilege, and it is very hard upon poor people. We must build houses and we only get one rent for building a house which will cost between £40 and £50, we buying lime from the Duke. It is only one rent that is granted us for the house, and —a thing that is very strange—upon the Tongue side they there get, from glass which goes into the window to the floor that goes under their feet, all the wood they required; and we have the same proprietor. The slates for the house are paid in three instalments.",443,"Alexander Morrison","Sutherland, Kinlochbervie",14
