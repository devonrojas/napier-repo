"25","24566. What was the rent you paid for the former place?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",25
"26","—When I married, the rent was 10s., and I took off the roof and made some improvement on it, and there was 10s. raised on me.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",26
"27","24567. What land did you occupy for the 10s. without counting the improvements ?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",27
"28","—I cannot say; about an acre I think.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",28
"29","24568. Which was already improved?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",29
"30","—Yes.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",30
"31","24569. And then you improved more ?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",31
"32","—Yes, and there was 10s raised on me.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",32

"36","—A cow and some sheep.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",36
"37","24572. How many sheep?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",37
"38","—I could not say. They were running at large; they were merely small things.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",38
"39","24573. But you had the whole of that for 10s?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",39
"40","—That is what my wife paid when I came to the house.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",40

"42","—There was 10s.raised on me.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",42
"43","24575. But for the land already cultivated, and for the outrun for cattle and sheep, you paid 10s.; what improvements did you make?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",43
"44","—I took off the roof and put on a new one, and I improved some of the land, and then there was 10s. raised on me.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",44
"45","24576. How soon was the 10s. put on after you improved the land?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",45
"46","—Half a year after, I think.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",46
"47","24577. How do you know that the 10s. was put on for improving the land, and was not a natural rise for the land you before occupied, which was low rented?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",47
"48","—It was an old woman and my wife who were in it, and it was low rented. But I improved again, and as soon as I improved the second time, there was 10s. put on again.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",48
"49","24578. How much did you improve the second time?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",49
"50","—About two acres, I think, of hill pasture.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",50
"51","24579. You made hill pasture into arable ground, and 10s. was put upon you?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",51
"52","—Yes.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",52
"53","24580. How long after this was it that you were removed?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",53
"54","—I was in it somewhere between ten and eleven years.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",54
"55","24581. When you were removed, did you get any compensation?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",55
"56","—None.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",56
"57","24582. What year was that in?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",57
"58","—I could not be sure.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",58
"59","24583. Somebody says 1857; is that so?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",59
"60","—I think so.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",60
"61","24584. You were removed to the place you now occupy : what is the rent of it?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",61
"62","—It was £2 when I got it. There was about an acre of ground, and I built houses. There were no houses on it then, they were down, and I built houses and occupied the ground for some years, and then I improved it.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",62
"63","24585. How much land did you take in?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",63
"64","—I could not say. I think I had about three acres then, and I had a fourteen years' lease.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",64
"65","24586. How many acres of cultivated land were there in this place when you first went there?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",65
"66","—I think about an acre.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",66
"67","24587. And what was the rent—£2?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",67
"68","—Yes.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",68
"69","24588. Had you a fourteen years' lease then?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",69
"70","—Yes.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",70
"71","24589. And during that time did you improve the land?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",71
"72","—Yes.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",72
"73","24590. How much land did you improve?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",73
"74","—I couldn't just say. I think about two or three acres.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",74
"75","24591. Was the rent raised upon you?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",75
"76","—Yes.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",76
"77","24592. At the end of the fourteen years' lease?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",77
"78","—Yes.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",78
"79","24593. You came to an agreement with the landlord?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",79
"80","—Yes.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",80
"81","24594. But for these fourteen years you had the croft for £ 2?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",81
"82","—Yes.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",82
"83","24595. What stock did you keep in it?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",83
"84","—Generally two cattle.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",84
"85","24596. Any sheep?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",85
"86","—Two or three sheep too.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",86
"87","24597. You heard the previous witness mention that the rents were very high in this parish : do you consider £2 a high rent for a croft of that size?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",87
"88","—I did not consider it was high then.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",88
"89","24598. What is it now?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",89
"90","—Six guineas.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",90
"91","24599. Do you keep any more stock upon it?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",91
"92","—Not so many, because the pasture was taken from me to a great extent. There is a small portion of the ground yet in peat-moss and bracken, but nothing worth.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",92
"93","24600. Describe exactly what took place after the rent was raised at the end of the fourteen years. When you entered into a new arrangement with the landlord did you get a fresh lease?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",93
"94","—Yes, for seven years.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",94
"95","24601. What took place exactly, did you go to the landlord and ask a fresh lease, or did tne factor come to you, or how?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",95
"96","—When the lease was out and I paid my rent, I asked for a lease again.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",96
"97","24602. What answer did you get?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",97
"98","—I got the answer that I would get a lease for seven years.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",98
"99","24603. What answer did you make to that?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",99
"100","—I had to take it.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",100
"101","24604. Did you say anything at the time?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",101
"102","—I said I had to take it. ",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",102
"103","24605. But did you make any objection or say that the rent was too high?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",103
"104","—No doubt I did that; I did so.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",104
"105","24606. You said that the rent was too high?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",105
"106","—Yes.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",106
"107","24607. Did you take the place all the same ?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",107
"108","—I had to take it because I had built a house and improved the ground, and what could I do. I had nowhere to go to.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",108
"109","24608. You had no option but to take it?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",109
"110","—No.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",110
"111","24609. And you just took the lease?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",111
"112","—Just so.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",112
"113","24610. At the end of the seven years what happened?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",113
"114","—Another pound was put on.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",114
"115","24611. And did the same conversation take place between you and the factor?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",115
"116","—Just the same.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",116
"117","24612. You said that it was too high, and the factor said he thought it was not?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",117
"118","—Yes.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",118
"119","24613. And you ended by taking it on another tack?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",119
"120","—Yes.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",120
"121","24614. Did you hear the Rev. Mr MacCallum mention that there were outrages committed in the district?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",121
"122","—Yes, I heard of that.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",122
"123","24615. Would you describe the nature of those outrages —what were they?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",123
"124","—I cannot: it was in a different district from where I stay.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",124
"125","24616. They did not commit the outrages in your district?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",125
"126","—No, I just heard of them.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",126
"127","24617. What did they do, did they hough the cattle ?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",127
"128","—No, but I think they broke some farm utensils : I don't remember of them injuring any cattle.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",128
"129","24618. Professor Mackinnon.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",129
"130","—Is your own statement of complaint much the same as that of the people round about you?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",130
"131","—Much the same I think.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",131
"132","24619. You had a place first for fourteen years and then the rent was increased: would you consider it fair that it should be increased a bit at the end of that lease?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",132
"133","—I would have allowed a little, but I think it was increased too much.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",133
"134","24620. Your complaint is that it was increased too much ?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",134
"135","—Yes, I would be willing to give what a conscientious man would say it was worth, but I would not like to give the rent I was giving before. When I was young and fit to work I could give it, but now I am getting old.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",135
"136","24621. Do you think you would have made more of it —that you would have improved it more—if you had what you consider fairer terms?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",136
"137","—Yes; and I would have put up better houses too. The houses are generally very little worth now, since I built them thirty years ago, and I liave no lease, but hold from year to year.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",137
"138","24622. Do you think your neighbours also would have improved their places more if they had longer leases and lower rents? ",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",138
"139","—I am sure of it. If they had any security of the property there is no doubt of it; and they would have built better houses too. But if you built houses and improved the property, the rent was raised; and if you didn't pay it you were put away.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",139
"140","24623. When you got the seven years' leases did you wish them for a longer term?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",140
"141","—I think we did, but I am not perfectly sure. I think we wanted them to be for fourteen years.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",141
"142","24624. When the seven years came to an end, you only held from year to year?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",142
"143","—I think I got another seven years' lease.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",143
"144","24625. Did you wish a lease at the end of the second seven years?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",144
"145","—Always.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",145
"146","24626. What was the reason you did not get a lease upon the last occasion?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",146
"147","—I cannot say. I was told that the whole place was offered to another big farm, to make sheep pasture. I was told by the man who holds the farm that he had an offer of the whole place, to add it on to his. farm.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",147
"148","24627. Did you consider the first lease of fourteen years at £ 2 fair terms?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",148
"149","—I did.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",149
"150","24628. What increase do you think would be reasonable to make on the rent since that time?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",150
"151","—Well, Mr Balfour, factor in Shapinshay, was there, and I understand he was looking at the place I spoke to him, as I thought he was a man of conscience—he is dead now—and he asked me what rent I paid. I told him four guineas, and he wanted to know how I could live on the place.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",151
"152","24629. He thought four guineas too high?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",152
"153","—He just wanted me to describe how I could hold the place and make a living out of it.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",153
"154","24630. And he was factor in Shapinshay at the time?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",154
"155","—-.Yes, and I think an excellent man.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",155
"156","24631. He was a man of knowledge and experience of the place?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",156
"157","—He was that.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",157
"158","24632. What would you consider a fair rent for your place upon along lease?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",158
"159","—£4 or four guineas; I would not wish to ask it for less I would be willing to give what a man of conscience would say it was worth, as long as I could.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",159
"160","24633. You would be willing to give what an outsider with knowledge and experience would say was a fair rent, if he knew the history of your improvements upon it, and your tenure in the past? ",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",160
"161","—I would.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",161
"162","24634. But once having built your houses upon it, and having remained there for years, you would not like to leave it?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",162
"163","—Where would I go?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",163
"164","24635. And even supposing a higher rent was charged you would still have remained?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",164
"165","—I would remain as long as I could, because when I had nothing to give I would have to be supported some way.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",165
"166","24636. But in fixing the rent you had no voice whatever?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",166
"167","—No.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",167
"168","24637. You would be able to make a living out of the croft if the rent was £4?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",168
"169","—No, I could not do that.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",169
"170","24638. Supposing you had it at £ 4? ",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",170
"171","—Well, I only have my wife now —my children are all away—and I might make a bit of endeavour to live in that way too.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",171
"172","24639. Your income would be at least £2, 6s. a year more than it is?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",172
"173","—Still, that would be a good deal.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",173
"174","24640. Have you any other means of livelihood beside the croft—work or fishing of any kind?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",174
"175","—I used to go to the fishing, and I used to make shoes and carry on any kind of work; but now I am not fit for that, and it takes me my whole time to work on the croft. In that way I ask for nothing.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",175
"176","24641. What kind of stock do you keep?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",176
"177","—Cattle.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",177
"178","24642. Are they of the old Orkney breed?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",178
"179","—There are not many of them here now.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",179
"180","24643. What is the breed?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",180
"181","—Just cross breed.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",181
"182","24644. And what stock of sheep have you?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",182
"183","—I have three.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",183
"184","24645. What kind?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",184
"185","—Just crosses.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",185
"186","24646. And it is the outcome of that stock that you pay the rent with?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",186
"187","—It must be relied on that, indeed. I have four head of cattle at the present time. But I must only keep two for this season, because we have no crop which is worth.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",187
"188","24647. Is the crop very bad this year?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",188
"189","—Cruelly bad; I think we have just about half what we had last year.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",189
"190","24648. Are you able to summer more stock than your crop can winter for you?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",190
"191","—Yes, owing to this piece of outbreak of hill above us. We drive them to it, but it just keeps them alive, and no more; it is only heather and peat moss. But we buy for them in winter.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",191
"192","24649. Could you pay rent in the old place you were in forty years ago?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",192
"193","—Yes.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",193
"194","24650. And now you are afraid after being forty years in the place, and having built a house and improved the land, that you should be removed again?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",194
"195","—Yes. I cannot make any improvement on the place, because I have no security.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",195
"196","24651. The Chairman.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",196
"197","—Have you any horses?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",197
"198","—No.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",198
"199","24652. How many acres of arable land have you1?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",199
"200","—It was measured to me for ten and a half acres, the whole in a square.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",200
"201","24653. How much of that is in pasture, and how much do you break up in rotation?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",201
"202","—There may be about six or seven acres under the plough.",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",202

"286","24694. Why cannot you get seaware?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",286

"288","24695. Are your people generally well supplied with sea-ware?",415,"George Leonard","Orkney, Kirkwall",288
