"5","—' Ballvuilin and Kilmoluag. Our complaints, which we consider grievous, are, that a part of the “common,"" for all which we still pay, was taken from the township some fifty years ago; thirty-five years ago another part was taken off our common, and we still pay for that part also. When John Campbell, Esq., was factor on the estate, our rents were raised at three different times, so that they were nearly doubled. Previous to the raising of our rents, we had to come bound to him by compulsorily signing a paper that we would be obedient and submissive to any orders from him in all time coming. We signed this paper at the threat of instant eviction. The third rise in the rents was made for drainage. We have to pay for the sea-ware we use as manure, either in money or take twenty carts to the land of the farmer on whose shore the sea-ware is got. This is equal to five or six days' work. We have also to complain that when our growing grass is in need of the greatest care, the manager of the Seaweed Company sends his horses and carts through our grounds, and states that he has authority to do so. The above complaints apply to both townships.",568,"Donald Campbell, Donald Maclean","Argyll, Tyree",5
"6","—Kilmoluag. The whole township of Kilmoluag had to sign a paper to the then factor, Mr Geikie, to give to a neighbouring farmer out of their common as much land as he chose to take from us, which, if they (the crofters) did not consent to do, he threatened he would send every mother's son of them out of the island.",568,"Donald Campbell, Donald Maclean","Argyll, Tyree",6

"8","—'To the Honourable the Royal Commissioners appointed to inquire into the State of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. We, the cottars of Ballvuilin and Kilmoluag, want to let you know the poor condition we are in through a great many causes (too numerous to mention), some of which we will try to state here. We have got houses built on the crofters' common, and the landlord wants us to pay rent for the sites, although the crofters are paying for it already. We cannot prosecute the fishing with safety for the want of harbours for the safety of our boats. We had a sort of a quay at Kilmoluag, but the big tide that was two or three years ago tore it down, and it has never been mended yet. We are making kelp, and are paid at the rate of £ 4 per ton of 2520 lbs. with goods, which are charged for more than in any shop or store in the island. There are sixty cottars between Ballvuilin aud Kilmoluag, and we are troubling the crofters very much getting ground to plant potatoes in, as their holdings are so small (a thing that is out of the question to get from the tacksmen); also getting horses and carts for a great many things we need them for. Some of us had crofts, but they were taken from us without any known reason but to please the factor that was here at the time. What we most want is a bit of land to plant potatoes in and grazing for a cow or two, and harbours for our fishing boats.",568,"Donald Campbell, Donald Maclean","Argyll, Tyree",8

"72","34174. Are there enough of them in the position of being able to build houses for themselves and stock the new lands—are they in sufficient numbers that would much relieve Ballvuilin and Kilmoluag if they went ?",568,"Donald Campbell, Donald Maclean","Argyll, Tyree",72

"92","—Perhaps not even £2.",568,"Donald Campbell, Donald Maclean","Argyll, Tyree",92

"103","—Certainly it would be better for them.",568,"Donald Campbell, Donald Maclean","Argyll, Tyree",103
