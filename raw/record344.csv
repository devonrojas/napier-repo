"11","19114. What stock to you keep ?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",11
"12","—We have about eight cattle—winter stock,—and about forty sheep; and we have some grazing cattle which go away in the harvest time.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",12
"13","19115. And how many horses?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",13

"22","—Not as a rule, but I might take in a beast from any one.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",22
"23","19120. What is the price of the summer grazing of a beast here if you did take one in?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",23
"24","—It used to be about £1, for four or five months. I have not been long here, only about two years.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",24
"25","19121. Where did you come from?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",25
"26","—The mainland.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",26

"29","19123. Had you a farm on the mainland?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",29
"30","—I had a croft;—a smaller one.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",30
"31","19121. You took this one because you thought it better?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",31
"32","—It was better, no doubt. I had to go away from there because they doubled my rent when the lease was out; when I got a lease from Mr Walker, he doubled the old rent and I thought I might have been better looked after by the major, but he doubled it at the end of the lease too.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",32
"33","19125. You took this place two years ago?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",33

"39","19128. And when that is ended, do you expect the rent will be doubled again?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",39
"40","—I don't know what Mr Leask may do. I have a new proprietor now—one of the young men. The old man is dead.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",40
"41","19129. Have you anything to do in repairing the building?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",41

"43","19130. Have you a slated roof?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",43

"51","19134-. Do you live entirely by farming, or are you otherwise employed?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",51
"52","—I fence a good deal; I put up fences —I am here for that purpose.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",52
"53","19135. But you found your farm fenced when you went to it?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",53
"54","—No, it was a turf dyke, and would not keep out anything.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",54
"55","19136. Did you put up the fences yourself?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",55
"56","—No, Mr Leask, gave me the material, and I have to pay the interest on that.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",56
"57","19137. Besides the £25?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",57
"58","—Yes; and our taxes are very heavy.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",58

"60","—6 per cent, on the whole cost of the fence.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",60
"61","19139. What does that come to?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",61
"62","—55s., and we are taxed on that interest",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",62
"63","19140. What are the taxes in your parish?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",63
"64","—About 6s. 6d. in the pound I think.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",64
"65","19111. But you only pay half?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",65
"66","—Half on us —school rate and poor rate.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",66
"67","19112. What arable land have you got?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",67
"68","—I think about fifteen acres, but it is in a miserable state —all wet; and he binds me to improve the",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",68
"69","land at that rept.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",69
"70","19113. Have you anything to complain about?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",70
"71","—No, I have not so much to complain about now as I had before. We are charged so much a sheep for being in the scathold, besides what I have mentioned. He charges 6d. a head.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",71
"72","19144. But you keep forty sheep on your own ground?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",72
"73","—Yes.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",73
"74","19115. And you have other sheep on the scathold?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",74
"75","—I have none, but other tenants have. They don't know about this meeting; they are all away at the fishing and I would not have known of it, had I not been over here working.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",75
"76","19116. Have the tenants any general grievance?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",76
"77","—I think the most they have to grieve at is the want of leases, and rents being raised on them for improving. They don't raise the rent on a fellow who don't improve.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",77
"78","19117. You think the rent has been raised in proportion to the amount of improvement?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",78
"79","—I know some of them have got a good rise by improving.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",79
"80","19148. How long is a man generally allowed to enjoy his improvements before the rent is raised ?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",80
"81","—In olden times he might have gone on ten or fifteen years, and perhaps have a new place at no rent, and then perhaps they would get a rent of 30s. or 40s. according to what improvements had been made. That is the way my grandfather started the place I left.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",81
"82","19119. Had he anything like a lease?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",82
"83","—No, but he lived in the place until he was 81 years of age.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",83
"84","19150. Had he a promise of it?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",84
"85","—Yes, from Mrs Mowat. They were not so ready to remove in those days; there was no sheep farming. We were in it only two years ago, when the major, after I laid out £50 or £60 upon it, doubled tho rent. My last lease in that place was fourteen years. I got it from Mr Walker.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",85
"86","19151. What was Walker?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",86
"87","—He would be, I think, factor, and would have shares with Major Cameron in this sheep farming.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",87
"88","19152. They took away the scatholds from the people?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",88
"89","—They did, and drove away the people; they took the crofts wherever they could make the best sheep farms. A good many of them came over to Yell and North Maven, and anywhere they could get a place.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",89
"90","19153 The Chairman.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",90
"91","—Major Cameron asked you for an increase of rent. Was it double the rent ?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",91
"92","—He doubled it at the end of the lease.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",92
"93","19154. Then you left Did Major Cameron let your holding to another tenant?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",93
"94","—Yes.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",94
"95","19155. And what increase of rent did be get from the other tenant?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",95
"96","—I think 5s. more than I was paying. He got the tenant in after I left.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",96
"97","19156. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",97
"98","—Not at double the rent?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",98
"99","—No.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",99
"100","19157. The Chairman.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",100
"101","—Would you have taken the farm at an increase of 5s.?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",101
"102","—I would not have left it for a pound or so.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",102
"103","19158. The new tenant took it for 5s. more than you paid before?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",103
"104","—Yes; that was all he could get.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",104
"105","19159. Professor Mackinnon.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",105
"106","—He could not get the double rent ?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",106
"107","—No.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",107
"108","19160. The Chairman.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",108
"109","—But now you pay £25 for your holding, which contains eight cattle, five horses, and forty sheep—that is within the fence?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",109
"110","—Yes.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",110
"111","19161. Is there any land within the fence which you could still improve, and turn into arable?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",111
"112","—Yes, and I will do it; I am so far bound to do it; but I would do it without being asked to do it.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",112
"113","19162. Because you have a lease?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",113
"114","—Yes, and I know the benefit of improving.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",114
"115","19163. What kind of house is it you have? How many rooms are there in it ?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",115
"116","—Four rooms.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",116
"117","19164. Do you mean four rooms on the ground floor, or two below and two above?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",117
"118","—Two above and two below.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",118
"119","19165. It is built of stone and lime?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",119
"120","—Yes.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",120
"121","19166. How old is it?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",121
"122","—I could not tell exactly. It was repaired last year, the walls raised, and a new roof put on it. I cannot complain about the house.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",122
"123","19167. I want to know whether your house is a good one?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",123
"124","—Yes, the house is not bad.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",124
"125","19168. How much do you suppose the proprietor laid out in sorting and repairing it?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",125
"126","—I could not exactly say. He was only at the cost of the wood and mason work; I did the rest I put on the roof.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",126
"127","19169. Did he pay for the canvas and tar?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",127
"128","—Yes, canvas, tar, wood, and mason work.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",128
"129","19170. Would he lay out £40?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",129
"130","—No, not £20.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",130
"131","19171. How much did you lay out?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",131

"135","—Yes.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",135

"137","—Yes, the most of them are at the fishing.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",137
"138","19174. What is the average rent they pay, off and on, in that place?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",138
"139","—I think somewhere from £4 to £6—perhaps a little more; say from £3 to £6. I know there are some as low as £3.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",139
"140","19175. Are there many of them on the same property as you?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",140
"141","—A good many; I could not say exactly the number.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",141
"142","19176. Is the whole of the west shore of Yell there under small. tenants except your own?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",142
"143","—Yes, the proprietor owns the whole district with the exception of some small patches.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",143
"144","19177. Does he stay in the place?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",144
"145","—No, he stays in Lerwick.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",145
"146","19178. What is he besides?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",146
"147","—He is a merchant in Leith—J. B. Leask.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",147
"148","19179. lie does not keep a place in the west of Yell?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",148
"149","—He has a store or shop.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",149
"150","19180. Does he cure fish?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",150

"152","19181. But I suppose the people upon his own property sell the fish to him—those who do fish?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",152
"153","—The cod and ling fish.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",153
"154","19182. Do they take their stores from him?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",154
"155","—I expect so.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",155
"156","19183. Has that property been long in the family?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",156
"157","—No, I think the late Mr Leask bought it from the Braces.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",157
"158","19184. Who is the neighbouring proprietor—Major Cameron has property there, has he not?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",158

"160","19185. That is full of crofters?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",160

"169","—No, he belongs to Caithness, I think.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",169
"170","19190. Is that a large property?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",170
"171","—There is some in East Yell, and some in West and South; there is a whole lot of it.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",171
"172","19191. Does Mr Keith manage the whole of it?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",172

"174","19192. Do they engage in herring fishing as well as cod and ling fishing on the west coast?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",174
"175","—Only those in the big boats.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",175
"176","19193. Where do they go to the deep sea fishing from there?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",176
"177","—To the north.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",177

"179","—Yes, I suppose so.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",179
"180","19195. Do they go far out?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",180
"181","—Forty or fifty miles out, I daresay, in the summer time.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",181
"182","19196. And the big boats are chiefly engaged in the herring fishing?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",182
"183","—As a rule they fish for ling too, at least most of them.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",183
"184","19197. How many has Mr Leask of these boats?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",184
"185","—There are only two of the big boats, I think, in West Yell.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",185
"186","19198. The smaller class of boats belong to the people themselves?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",186
"187","—I rather think he finds the boats his tenants are fishing with.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",187
"188","19199. The old sixerns as well as the new class of boats?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",188
"189","—Yes, but there are not many of the old boats now.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",189
"190","19200. Does he arrange with them on the half-catch system?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",190
"191","—Not in the small boats. I think they pay hire for the boats and lines in that case, and some of them own their own boats.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",191
"192","19201. Is the arrangement in the smaller class of boats, that the boats and fines belong to the curer?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",192
"193","—They used to pay so much hire for the boat.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",193
"194","19202. How much for the season?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",194
"195","—I forget if it was £3 or 50s.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",195
"196","19203. And did he keep the boat and lines in order for that?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",196
"197","—No, the lines were separate.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",197
"198","19204. They were their own?",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",198
"199","—Yes, or a separate transaction or hire of them was made.",344,"Thomas Green","Mid Yell, Raefirth",199
