"1","DONALD MATHIESON, Kneep (64)—examined.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",1
"2","13784. The Chairman.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected a delegate by your people?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",3
"4","—Yes.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",4
"5","13785. Have you a statement to make on their behalf ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",5
"6","—They complain of some hardships connected with the administration of the estate—the holdings made less and the rents increased. My father and grandfather lived in this township. In my grandfather's day the township was divided among eight, and the total rent was £40. This was about eighty years ago. The rent is now £80. There are twenty-six families, of whom seventeen are crofters. Some of the township was taken from us, also some of the islands that used to summer our cattle, and also moorland pasture.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",6
"7","13786. How long is it since the moorland pasture was taken away?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",7
"8","—The islands were taken away from us about fifty-five years ago. They were given to Alexander Macrae of Kintail. We were deprived of the moorland pasture about forty years ago, and it was given to a neighbouring tacksman. We march with sheep runs all round. About 1850 the township that marched with us was cleared, and a bit of our township was taken from us, and added to that cleared township. The tacksman was Mr John Macrae, the son of the Macrae who got the islands before. ",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",8
"9","13787. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",9
"10","—What was the name of the township that was cleared?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",10
"11","—Reef. In the days I spoke of, in my grandfather's days, when they had the land at a reasonable rent, they were making a comfortable living. They had a pair of horses, five milk cows, and other cows such as young animals that were sent to the islands, and about forty sheep. The horses were done away with, and they themselves had often to do horses' work; and now if a man marries a wife, he must yoke her in a cart. Now, having lost all our grazings, and with the amount of ground we have now, supposing I had two cows, I would require to sell one in order to keep up the other; and if I have about a dozen sheep or so at",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",11
"12","Martinmas, they will be worried by the neighbouring tacksmen, whose dogs continually harass them, and poind them, so that we are scarcely able to live at all.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",12
"13","13788. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",13
"14","—What rent do you yourself pay ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",14
"15","—£4, 4s. bare rent, with taxes in addition.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",15
"16","13789. What stock do you actually keep ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",16
"17","—Three cows, two stirks, and ten sheep.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",17
"18","13790. No horse?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",18
"19","—No, I have no horse. There is no horse in the place. They would not be allowed to be kept there. They were all sold.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",19
"20","13791. How many barrels of potatoes do you plant?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",20
"21","—About twelve.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",21
"22","13792. And how many barrels of barley?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",22
"23","—One barrel of barley and half a barrel of oats.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",23
"24","13793. What return do you get from these?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",24
"25","—The land has got exhausted through continuous cropping, but I get about forty barrels of potatoes and sometimes as low as twenty.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",25
"26","13794. What is the best return you recollect getting within the last ten years ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",26
"27","—Sixty. The cattle required it all for the last two years.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",27
"28","13795. What return do you get of bere and oats ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",28
"29","—I would make about six returns the year before last. ",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",29
"30","13796. Of bere?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",30
"31","—Yes. ",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",31
"32","13797. Besides the seed?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",32
"33","—Six returns altogether, seed included.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",33
"34","13798. And oats ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",34
"35","—The land has got exhausted, as stated before. The best crop of oats I ever had was two barrels out of a half barrel I sowed.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",35
"36","13799. You give most of this produce to your own cattle?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",36
"37","—Yes, so they must; there is nothing else for them.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",37
"38","13800. What amount of meal are you obliged to buy?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",38
"39","—I bought about twenty bolls last year. I have already bought sixteen this year.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",39
"40","13801. Since when?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",40
"41","—Just after the crop is lifted. I begin to buy just after the income of the crop is eaten up.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",41
"42","13802. In what way do you make the money that enables you to buy this meal?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",42
"43","—Partially by the selling of stock, and fishing at the east coast and elsewhere.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",43
"44","13803. Do you fish here at all ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",44
"45","—Not of late; I am too old now.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",45
"46","13804. Does your family fish here?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",46
"47","—Yes.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",47
"48","13805. Have they got a big boat?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",48
"49","—No. In addition to the sufferings we endure through the shepherds, we are also injured very much by the deer-forest. Supposing any of our own cattle are feeding out upon our own moorland pasture, no one is allowed by the regulations of the estate to attend to them or follow them except the herd. Even supposing any of them had a broken leg, no other person is entitled to go and look after it. Supposing any of the sheep were losing their wool, or anything of that sort, we are not allowed to go after them to shear them. One day is appointed for that purpose, and if the sheep are not found on that day they must go without being shorn at all.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",49
"50","13806. Has the herd the right to go a second time?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",50
"51","—Yes, he has the right, but when the sportsmen come he must look out.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",51
"52","13807. When do the sportsmen come?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",52
"53","—At the end of summer.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",53
"54","13808. Do the deer damage your crofts at all?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",54
"55","—Not in our particular township, but in other parts of the parish they injure the crops.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",55
"56","13809. How long has your rent stood at £4, 4s. ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",56
"57","—About sixteen years.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",57
"58","13810. What was it before then ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",58
"59","—I paid at first £3, 15s.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",59
"60","13811. Why was it raised?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",60
"61","—I don't know. The rent of our township was raised £ 10 in one year, and four men were put in upon us. Then 5s. was put upon us for peat ground, and then 1s. was put upon each of us which they called hen money; that is 6s. But now that is rent, and it is not set down as a separate rent",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",61
"62","13812. Were you in the habit of giving kain hens in addition to the rent before ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",62
"63","—We never paid any kain hens within my time.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",63
"64","13813. But did they always pay the shilling in your time?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",64
"65","—No",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",65
"66","13814. Then why was the 1s. put on?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",66
"67","—I cannot tell, except that that was about the time it was put upon us by the chamberlain Donald Munro.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",67
"68","13815. Why was it called hen money ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",68
"69","—I don't know why it was called by that name.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",69
"70","13816. What was the name of the island you lost?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",70
"71","—Little Wia. Our township had the whole of it, and then we had a portion of Yacasay, the island which the previous delegate spoke of. That was what our township separately held.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",71
"72","13817. You mentioned that four families had been put in upon you. Where did they come from ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",72
"73","—From another township that was cleared—Dun of Carloway.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",73
"74","13818. Have any other families been put in upon you at any time besides these four ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",74
"75","—Not since I became a crofter. The increase has been the natural increase of the land, except these four.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",75
"76","13819. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",76
"77","—Who has that island, Little Wia, and the half of that other island ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",77
"78","—James Macrae has Little Wia and Alexander Macrae has the portion of Vacasay which belonged to our township.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",78
"79","13820. Have they a good deal of land besides ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",79
"80","—They have. Alexander has a very large stretch of country—four townships added together.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",80
"81","13821. Why were these islands taken from the Kneep people ? ",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",81
"82","—I cannot tell, except to make the oppressors that came in more comfortable, and provide them with wintering for their stock.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",82
"83","13822. Was it for the benefit of the people of Kneep ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",83
"84","—On the contrary, to our great injury.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",84
"85","13823. Is the latter state of Kneep worse than the beginning?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",85
"86","—Sevenfold worse—sevenfold and seventeen times, and I say so.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",86
"87","13824. You mentioned that the town of Reef was cleared. Do you know how many families were cleared out of Reef ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",87
"88","—Several.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",88
"89","13825. Would there be twenty altogether?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",89
"90","—There were about twentyeight.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",90
"91","13826. What became of them?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",91
"92","—They suffered great hardship and oppression in their removal. I remember it well myself. They were scattered here and there, and some were seut abroad—some to other places where hardly a snipe could live.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",92
"93","13827. Who has Reef now?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",93
"94","—James Mackenzie, Linshader.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",94
"95","13828. In regard to the forest, is there any fence for keeping the deer in ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",95
"96","—No.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",96
"97","13829. No fence whatever?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",97
"98","—No, they have the run of our own moorland pasture for grouse and shooting.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",98
"99","13830. Supposing you got these islands back again, would they help you very much in your condition ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",99
"100","—Certainly.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",100
"101","13831. Is your own position very much worse than the position of your grandfather ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",101
"102","—-Very much indeed. I must live henceforth on the earnings of other people—on my own family whom I reared under great hardship. The croft which I possess does not contribute much to my support.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",102
"103","13832. You mentioned formerly you had been in the habit of going away and earning money for the support of your family in other places, but you are now too old to do so. Is that correct ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",103
"104","—Yes.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",104
"105","13833. Was it necessary for your grandfather to go away out of this place to earn his living ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",105
"106","—Never beyond the bounds of the township.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",106
"107","13834. The Chairman.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",107
"108","—Does the common pasture—the hill pasture of the township—march with the deer forest ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",108
"109","—The grazing of Valtos comes between us and the actual forest, but the sportsmen have the run of all the ground for shooting purposes.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",109
"110","13835. The sportsmen have the right of shooting grouse and deer over your common pasture ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",110
"111","—He has the right to go through our crops in the shooting season, and he exercises the right of going through our crops and shooting snipe along the shore and elsewhere.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",111
"112","13836. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",112
"113","—With dogs?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",113
"114","—Yes.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",114
"115","13837. Do they take dogs through the corn?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",115
"116","—They went through it quite common last summer.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",116
"117","13838. The Chairman.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",117
"118","—Do the shooting tenants do your stock and crop any substantial injury?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",118
"119","—Well it never was complained of, but there is no doubt that there were some places where substantial injury was done.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",119
"120","13839. Do the shooting tenants show you any kindness or render you any service of any sort ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",120
"121","—We hold no communication with them.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",121
"122","13840. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",122
"123","—Or they with you?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",123
"124","—There is no communication between us at all.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",124
"125","13841. The Chairman.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",125
"126","—Do the gamekeepers molest you or do you any hurt?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",126
"127","-— We have nothing to complain of in that respect, except the matter of the heather. The hill is set apart at the beginning of autumn, and if we cannot get at the heather that week we must do without, whatever injury may befall us for want of it.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",127
"128","13842. Do you get sea-weed from the shore?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",128
"129","—Yes.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",129
"130","13843. Do you pay anything?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",130
"131","—No, nothing whatever.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",131
"132","13844. Do you get anything from the tacksman's shore or only from your own ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",132
"133","—We take it off our own shore, but there was a portion preserved of the shore which belonged to neither tacksman nor crofter, which was occupied by the proprietor for the manufacture of kelp. That is not used now, and we get the use of it.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",133
"134","13845. And do you pay anything?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",134
"135","—Nothing. We would not be allowed to go upon the tacksman's land.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",135
"136","13846. Do you live on good terms with the tacksman ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",136
"137","—Some ten days ago some of our people went to gather drift-ware upon the tacksman's shore and were prevented doing so.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",137
"138","13847. Mr Cameron.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",138
"139","—Did I understand you to say that the sportsmen habitually shoot snipe in standing corn with dogs ?",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",139
"140","—I would say five or six times in the season. The shooting tenant pays £700 or £ 800 for the privilege of shooting over what is our ground and the ground of the neighbouring crofters—the moorland pasture—throughout the whole parish. The proprietor gets that amount of money without any outlay whatever on the place.",245,"Donald Mathieson","Lewis, Meavaig",140
