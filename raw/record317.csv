"1","JOHN M'LEOD, Crofter, Kershader (56)—examined.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",1
"2","17340. The Chairman.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",2
"3","—How many families are there at Kershader?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",3
"4","—Twenty families.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",4
"5","17341. Were you elected by the heads of these families?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",5
"6","—Yes.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",6
"7","17342. Were they all present at the time?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",7
"8","—The most of them were together.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",8
"9","17343. Will you state what they sent you here to say?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",9
"10","—There are three townships there, very near connected to each other—Habost, Kershader, and Garivaid—small villages situated on the south side there, and I was appointed to speak on behalf of these. The main grievances which the people have there, are the smallness of their holdings and the badness of them as well, and that makes them dear—not dear according to the space may be that we possess, but according to the hard labour we have in connection with them and the badness of the soil, so that the ground would not yield crop now as it would before, because the places are peopled so much, and each family has so little of it. Besides that, we have a general grievance on the south side for the want of any bit of road. We have not an inch of road, and we are paying according to other tenants in the country the same road money that they are paying, to the best of my kuowledge. Now, we have not an inch of road there, and I think there are several hundred families there on the south side. This same year we applied in some form or another to get a road there. That was refused. I cannot say who in fact was the author of refusing it, but one thing is, we are in want of it, and we are paying for it. Another thing they were anxious to state before the Commission, is a rise of rent that took place some years ago. There was 5s. charged upon each tenant for road money. Well, after a few years I think it was turned as moor pasture money upon the people, and the road money besides. To the best of our knowledge, this 5s. is included now in the present rent we pay, and the road money besides—so much per pound. Now, bad as the soil is, if the people had somewhat more of it, a little more than they have, they might, of course no doubt with hard labour, make a poor man's living of it--not very luxurious or easy —and I can prove that when a man goes there with a creel on his back all the days of his life, with his spade in his hand, working with the spade—and very often when I was a fisherman I had to go down with my sea boots to the knee in the furrows of the rigs where I was putting a little seed, to turn it before I could put in seed there. Now, to-day I am cutting my peats in the rigs that I had twenty years back under cultivation, and to-day they will give no crop, and the best I can make out of them is to cut them in bits to burn. I am sure the worst grievance we have is that there are so many squatters there, and though the tenants suffer very much from that condition, the squatters suffer more. I don't know what life I could compare to a poor man's life squatting there, because to my great misfortune I was there for a long time myself, and I suffered for it and I suffer for it still, and I have no person to blame for it but myself, for I was a long time in that condition. Matters with us at present are not so very bad, no doubt, but still our taxes and everything of that sort are unbearable to the poor people. They cannot stand it. We had sea-weed there, and some of that was taken from us, and the rent was not reduced to my knowledge. I don't think that it was. The only remedy that they expect to get for that is if Lady Matheson kindly would think to give more land to these people that are distressed there. While we have to acknowledge Lady Matheson's kindness in every way,—as Mr Mackay referred to that we must acknowledge it, especially this year and other years,—but still the burden is upon the people in a way that they cannot bear. They cannot live in any way like a free kingdom's subjects. If they can, it is out of any of our knowledge how to do unless we get some more land. Now, the land next to us on the south side here is quite fit for poor people, and I will give you one instance. My grandfather was in Park before he was removed to make a place for sheep and deer. Well, one year he got £ 4 for twenty three-year-old wedders. The other people of the township were envying him for getting so much. I mention that as an example to show that the land is quite fit for a poor man to live in it, and to give more rent. As the first witness spoke about his nephew who went to America, I may say that the boy left our place, and the witness will excuse me when I say that he did not go back to help his father, but he was of necessity forced to go back to his father's house, for he joined the Hudson Bay Company's service as a hired man, and he did not succeed there, and then in the process of his way to Hudson Bay he had to go back to Canada to his father's house, and was not there but for a short time. That is a trustworthy man, Donald M'Leod, from the township of Kershader, and I had a letter from a neighbour there telling me of the poor condition of Donald M'Leod —a man we could believe as far as we could believe any man we ever saw, and many here who can testify the same. Now, we cannot think of going there in the face of all this. And now the fishing of the sea is taken away in the course of the providence of the Most High. We may acknowledge that our sins are the author of it, but for all that we are suffering on that account, and we earnestly wish not to blame any proprietor, or chamberlain, or ground officer; but we might mention, if it were necessary, many instances that could show that we were suffering in connection with these things. Perhaps it will be better for this present meeting not to enlarge upon them. But the remedy for the distress is the main thing we are asking, and that is the only remedy the people think would do them—to get a road there and to get more land—and I hope, whatever shall be the result, we sbaU not have to pay more or any longer for what we have not—I mean the road. About the sea-weed, I cannot exactly say how it was, but we got the moor pasture and the seaweed in the rent before it was raised, and we possessed it up to a certain year; and 6s. or 5s. for each crofter was added to our rent, and we are paying that still. Lady Matheson no doubt gives money in charitable ways, but to the best of my knowledge not a penny was spent in the three small villages I have mentioned for houses or improvements yet. If there was, I will admit very soon that I was wrong; but only this, for which we sincerely thank her—we had a schoolhouse, and once or twice she gave us a little help in timber to keep up the schoolhouse. We acknowledged that, and still acknowledge it with gratitude.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",10

"14","17345. How many miles is it before you get to the high road?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",14
"15","—About 14 miles going round the loch.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",15

"27","17351. Where is the post-office now?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",27
"28","—It is in Balallan, in the most inconvenient place for the parish that can be.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",28
"29","17352. Is there not a post-office opposite to you across the ferry?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",29

"37","17355. And you say they lead a very hard life?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",37
"38","—I say so, and I can prove that",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",38
"39","17356. What do they work at?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",39
"40","—They are away to the fishing to earn wages, and to any place where they can get a job.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",40
"41","17357. But where do they go to?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",41
"42","—To the east coast and to the south, to Badenoch and to Glasgow, and any place where they can get work.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",42
"43","17358. How long do they stay away at one time?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",43
"44","—They have no certain rule—as long as the party who employs them agrees.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",44
"45","17359. Do they sometimes stay away for a whole year?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",45
"46","—Yes.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",46

"57","17365. You say you could cut peat on your old arable land?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",57
"58","—Yes, I do.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",58
"59","17366. Are you cultivating new land now?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",59
"60","—Yes.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",60
"61","17367. Did you improve it yourself ?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",61
"62","—Yes.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",62
"63","17368. Is there much more of that land capable of improvement?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",63
"64","—That same was not capable of improvement. I did my best to improve it since I had it, and it is not fit to yield any good crop.",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",64
"65","17369. But it yields better crops than your old land did?",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",65
"66","—Yes, of course, but not according to the expense. ",317,"John Mcleod","Lewis, Keose",66
