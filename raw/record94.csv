"1","ALEXANDER M'GILLIVRAY, Crofter at Aird, Sleat (about 60)—examined.",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",1
"2","4991. The Chairman.",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",2
"3","—Are you a fisherman as well as a crofter?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",3
"4","—I was a fisherman once, but not now. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",4
"5","4992. The paper containing your statement has been accidentally left behind, but in the meantime, till the paper comes, you may make a verbal statement ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",5
"6","—We had not much in the paper which we made up, but one thing that we were complaining of was the way in which we are cramped in our township. We are overforty in a township, which was originally occupied by nineteen families; and we are quite as ill off as regards the sea as we are with respect to the land, and more so. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",6
"7","4993. Whereabout is Aird ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",7
"8","—It is the extreme south end of Sleat. Any person of understanding can understand our condition. There are twelve years or more since we sent any seed to the m:R in our parish. It is twelve years since the mill in our parish was working at all. We are in a bad place for boats, without a port or a quay, and in danger of our lives every day we are going out to sea. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",8
"9","4994. Mr Cameron.",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",9
"10","—How did the change come about from nineteen persons in the township to forty?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",10
"11","—I was giving half of my lot to my son, and others were doing the same. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",11
"12","4995. It was owing to the subdivision of the township?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",12
"13","—Yes. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",13
"14","4996. Are there any regulations on the estate regarding subdivisions",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",14
"15","—No, not that I am aware of. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",15
"16","4997. Has the proprietoror factor ever remonstrated against these crofts being cut up into small lots?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",16
"17","—No. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",17
"18","4998. Were any persons brought from a distance and put on the township which you represent ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",18
"19","—No, not that I know of. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",19
"20","4999. In fact the increase in the holdings is owing entirely to the subdivision ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",20
"21","—Yes.  ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",21
"22","5000. Can you suggest any remedy for the state of things which you describe as to the fishing and the accommodation for boats ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",22
"23","—That we should get a sort of a quay made, which would not be very expensive, to which we could bring our boats in bad seasons. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",23
"24","5001 Do many of the people in your township fish ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",24
"25","—Yes, all of them. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",25
"26","5002. But I understand from you that many more would do so if they had the proper accommodation for boats ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",26
"27","—Yes. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",27
"28","5003. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",28
"29","—Is your condition much worse than it Alexander was thirty years ago?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",29
"30","—Very much more so, as we are turning the same ground constantly for the past sixty years, and it does not now yield crop. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",30
"31","5004. Do you think, if your numbers were again reduced to nineteen by any means whatever, your condition would then revert to its former prosperity ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",31
"32","—Yes, very much, ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",32
"33","5005. Would it be as good as before ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",33
"34","—No, owing to the exhausted condition of the soil. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",34
"35","5006. Is there no way of recovering the condition of the soil ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",35
"36","—Yes, there is, if the place were larger. The summing is so much, and though we should summer the summing, we are not able to winter them without buying food for them in other places. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",36
"37","5007. And what remedy do you propose ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",37
"38","—There is no doubt the place would come to be as good as it was before, if it were occupied by as few. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",38
"39","5008. Would any of them be prepared to emigrate if they received sufficient assistance ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",39
"40","—I cannot answer that question, as I did not consult the people about it. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",40
"41","5009. In what other way would you propose the population should be reduced ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",41
"42","—I don't know. I would leave that to wiser people than myself. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",42
"43","5010. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",43
"44","—You are down at the very point, I understand. What lands adjoin ? Is it a set of crofter tenants, or is it a big farm that is next to you ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",44
"45","—There is a small township in our own midst which was taken from us, I cannot tell how long ago. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",45
"46","5011. What is the name of that?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",46
"47","—Drennoch. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",47
"48","5012. The Chairman.",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",48
"49","—In your parish there is a township called Carradale?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",49
"50","—That is another place. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",50
"51","5013. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",51
"52","—What is the size of that township of Drennoch ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",52
"53","—Five tenants. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",53
"54","5014. Was your rent taken down when these people were put upon you ? ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",54
"55","—Yes. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",55
"56","5015. How much?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",56
"57","—About £10, I think; but I am not sure. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",57
"58","5016. What was the name of the township taken from you?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",58
"59","—Carradale. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",59
"60","5017. By whom is Carradale occupied now ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",60
"61","—-Macdonald of Tormore. It was taken not for him at all, but for tenants, and when the school board came in, the people were too far from the school, and it was too few to send a schoolmaster to them, and therefore they had to lift the people out of there and let them go; but we got the offer of the place again from Tormore, if we would take it. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",61
"62","5018. And you did not take it?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",62
"63","—No, some of them would not, and some would. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",63
"64","5019. But you might have got Carradale if you had liked?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",64
"65","—Yes. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",65
"66","5020. You did not object to the rent ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",66
"67","—No. (see Appendix A. XXIV)",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",67
"68","5021. You said that it would require wiser men than yourself to settle what shoidd be done with the surplus population. What is the nearest land to where you are that they could be settled upon anew ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",68
"69","—I do not know. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",69
"70","5022. You have come to state your grievances, but the Commissioners expect you so far as in your power to state your remedy?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",70
"71","—I would wish to do that, as I have come, and I should be very glad if I could do it. There is another thing that is troubling us very much—trawling herring in our northern lochs. I believe it is keeping down the people of this island as much as anything else that they are suffering. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",71
"72","5023. The Chairman.",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",72
"73","—Did you say that Carradale had formerly belonged to you ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",73
"74","—Yes. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",74
"75","5024. And that it was offered back to you, but some of the people objected to take it ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",75
"76","— Yes. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",76
"77","5025. What were the reasons given by those -who objected to take it back ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",77
"78","—Some of them could not stock it. The place which they had was heavy enough upon them. Again, the school-rates are very heavy upon us. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",78
"79","5026. What is the summing of the croft ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",79
"80","—It would keep six cows, if we could winter them. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",80
"81","5027. How many sheep ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",81
"82","—Thirteen sheep. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",82
"83","5028. Any horses ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",83
"84","—One horse. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",84
"85","5029. What is the rent at present without the public burdens ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",85

"88","—Yes. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",88
"89","5031. What are the public burdens in all ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",89
"90","—Last year they were 19s. 5d. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",90
"91","5032. Does that include the money for the doctor ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",91
"92","—No, there was 2s. 6d. of doctor's money besides that. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",92
"93","5033. What do you think a fair rent, considering your description of stock? How much for a cow, how much for a horse, and how much for a sheep, including wintering and summering ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",93
"94","—We are leaving that to more intelligent individuals than ourselves. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",94
"95","5034. In what respect does the trawling for herring injure you ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",95
"96","—When they are taking the small fish along with the big fish The young fish are killed while they are useless, the young fish being what we put to the fishing next year. I refer to herring. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",96
"97","5035. How long have you been suffering from this evil of trawling ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",97
"98","— There was not much done on our coast until within the past two years, especially last year, it spoiled them altogether. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",98
"99","5036. Where do the trawlers chiefly come from ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",99
"100","—From the south, some from the north, and some from the east coast. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",100
"101","5037. Have you anything to complain of in reference to your dealings with the local merchants ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",101
"102","—No, the merchants are very good to us. If they were not, we should be very ill off. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",102
"103","5038. Is it within your knowledge that at any time the factor of the estate was concerned in a shop ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",103
"104","—Not that I am aware of. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",104
"105","5039. Are the people very much in debt generally to the local shops ? ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",105
"106","—Yes. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",106
"107","5040. Have they at any time been obliged to sell their cattle to the factor and not in the open market ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",107
"108","—No. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",108
"109","5041. They have no complaint of that kind at all to make ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",109
"110","—No. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",110
"111","5042. Have you anything further to state ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",111
"112","—I have nothing else to say, but I was expected to speak for the little township that I referred to—Drennoch. I have not much to say about it. They were complaining of being confined, as others were. They have only got holdings worth £2, and that was heavy enough upon us. It is small enough for them. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",112
"113","5043. Have they any hill pasture ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",113
"114","—No, they have not much. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",114
"115","5044. Sheriff Nicolson.",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",115
"116","—They have some ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",116
"117","—They have a little. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",117
"118","5045. The Chairman.",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",118
"119","—Was any hill pasture taken away from them ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",119
"120","— No, not since they got it. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",120
"121","5046. Where were these people brought from ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",121
"122","—Throughout the district here and there. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",122
"123","5047. How do they support themselves ?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",123
"124","—They fish. ",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",124
"125","5048. You complain of the danger of fishing. Have many of your number been lost at sea?",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",125
"126","—Yes, and in bringing sea-weed ashore. The following is the statement on behalf of Aird :",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",126
"127","—There are nineteen lots in this township, all of them subdivided, some to the extent of being held by four persons. It was stated that the summing of stock was sometimes above and sometimes below the fixed estimate. It would appear that nearly all are both able and willing to take larger holdings and pay the rents. They complain that the mill stopped about twelve years ago, because there was little or no grain to grind, on account of the soil having run out through frequent cropping. With regard to hill pasture, it was stated that many years ago the township held the lands of Carradale and Point of Sleat, in addition to what they now hold, but that these two places were taken from them without consulting their wishes. Another complaint was, that about thirty-foul years ago, a loan of public money was granted to the township for draining, and that interest on this loan still continues to be charged. It was proposed and agreed that Alexander M'Gillivray and Ronald Robertson be appointed delegates from Aird.",94,"Alexander Mcgillivray","Skye, Isle Ornsay",127
