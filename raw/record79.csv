"1","NEIL NICOLSON, Crofter, Torrin (76)—examined. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",1
"2","(See Appendix A, XIII.) ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",2
"3","4444. The Chairman.",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",3
"4","—How long have you lived in Torrin ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",4
"5","—Sixty years. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",5
"6","4445. Were you freely elected a delegate by the people, of Torrin?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",6
"7","— Yes, or I should not have come. I was reluctant to come. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",7
"8","4446. Have you heard what Charles Mackenzie said ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",8
"9","—Yes, and I agree with him in every word, and it was truth he was saying. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",9
"10","4447. Have you anything to add to the statement ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",10
"11","—I will tell you how I got on all that time in the place in which I was. I was born in Sleat, and I was five years of age when the land was laid out into lots first, and the crofters in the township in which I was for more than ten years after it was made into lots were removed in order to give place to Major Macdonald, Waternish. That is what brought me to Torrin. These people had no place to go to. They were crowded into other townships. My father then had no place at all There was no vacant place in Sleat for him. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",11
"12","4448. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",12
"13","—What was the name of this place in Sleat ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",13
"14","—Linigarry and Kilbeg. My father could get no place in Sleat till the factor came to Strath to collect the rents. He then, evicted a man from Torrin, and placed my father in his holding. His croft was then £11 of rent. The surveyor came to value the land, and he made the valuation £12, 10s. Then there were ten of the crofters in the township complained that their lots were not good enough, and at the end of the year the factor came to enlarge their holdings at the expense of the township's grazing—the best grazing we had—and we got nothing for that. We got no reduction in our rents. Then poor rates came to be assessed upon us, which raised the rents again. We then got money for drains. I got £6, and I was paying 8s. 6d. of interest upon it, and we were promised that we would be relieved of it at the end of twenty years. That is two years since, and we are paying it still. Then Macdonald, Tormore, came and he gave us the worst blow of all. He raised the rents, and he laid rent upon cottars in each township, who had not an inch of ground beyond what their houses were built upon. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",14
"15","4449. The Chairman.",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",15
"16","—How much did Tormore raise it to ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",16
"17","—8s. 6d. was added for the drains, making £12, 18s. 6d., and it is now £13, 10s , besides all the other assessments that follow. It comes to £15. The assessment was 13s. for poor rates, and 14s. for school rates, and 3s. for road money. That is all except 4s. of doctor's money. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",17
"18","4450. Sheriff Nicolson.",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",18
"19","—What are the rates ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",19
"20","—The poor rate is about 1s. 1d. in the £1, and the school rate is 1d. in the £1,—tenant's share. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",20
"21","4451. The Chairman.",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",21
"22","—Then, in your recollection, your aggregate payments have been raised from £11 to £15?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",22
"23","—Yes. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",23
"24","4452. When the rent was £11, what was the price of cattle? What was the price of a cow when the rent was £11?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",24
"25","—Between £5 and £6. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",25
"26","4453. If you sell a cow, what is the price of the cow now ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",26
"27","—I behove £7 or £8 to-day. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",27
"28","4454. What was the price of a stirk, such as you now sell, thirty years ago ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",28
"29","—I would not get £1 for it thirty years ago. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",29
"30","4455. What would you get for it now ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",30
"31","—If it be a good stirk they may get £4 or £5. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",31
"32","4456. About sheep,",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",32
"33","—you have still sheep ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",33
"34","—Yes. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",34
"35","4457. What was the price of a wedder when you sold a wedder long ago?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",35
"36","—About forty years ago we would get 10s. or 12s. for a wedder. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",36
"37","4458. And what might you get at the present moment?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",37
"38","—We would get £1 for it to-day. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",38
"39","4459. When a cottar went out to labour, what were his wages thirty or forty years ago?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",39

"41","4460. And now, how much would it be?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",41
"42","—Between 15s. and £1 . ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",42
"43","4461. You have heard it generally stated that the condition of the people has deteriorated—that they are less flourishing now than they were before. Do you think that is in any degree owing to the imposition of the new rates—school rate and road money, and so on ? Is that one of the reasons why their condition has fallen off?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",43
"44","—Yes, it is making the burden heavier on the tenant. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",44
"45","4462. Would you rather pay the school rate and the road rate, and have the schools and the roads; or would you rather pay no rate, and have no schools and no roads ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",45
"46","—I have no scholars at alL To those who have scholars I believe the burden is very heavy upon them —paying so much in the £1 for them besides school fees, and their children going naked and barefooted to school because they cannot clothe them. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",46
"47","4463. Do you think, on the whole, that the teaching, under the present system, is good for them or not?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",47
"48","—I do not think that the schooling they are getting now-a-days is better in any way than the schooling they were getting in my early recollection; and we were in days gone by getting schooling gratis. All the schooling I got was under a parish schoolmaster; and our school, I believe, did not cost more than £20. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",48
"49","4464. You state you got the schooling gratis—who paid for it ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",49
"50","—The landlord. I was not paying at all. The schoolmaster was paid off the parish. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",50
"51","4465. Were there no fees at all ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",51
"52","—The scholars who came on well with arithmetic and grammar and Latin, and such branches, were paying a little. At that time, in winter and spring, I believe our school would average sixty scholars. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",52
"53","4466. In regard to the road, would you rather pay the road money, and have the road, or rather pay no road money, and have no road ?-",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",53
"54","—I would rather pay for the road, for it is passing my door, and it is very convenient to me. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",54
"55","4467. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",55

"59","—There were six at any rate in Kilbeg. Two of those who were put out of Kilbeg found a place on the mainland. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",59
"60","4469. In whose possession are the two places you refer to now ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",60
"61","—Tormore, I think, and more besides. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",61
"62","4470. Do you know a place called Suishnish ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",62
"63","—Yes. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",63

"72","4475. How many were removed from Boreraig ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",72
"73","—I don't remember, but it is ten lots that were in it. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",73
"74","4476. Who occupies those two places at present ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",74
"75","—Our minister had these places last ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",75
"76","4477. Do you know a place called Kilbride?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",76
"77","—I am not sure whether it was six or eight lots, but there were more than that of families. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",77
"78","4478. There are no crofters there now ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",78
"79","—Only a shepherd, and a servant with the minister. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",79
"80","4479. Do you know a place called Duisdale in Sleat?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",80
"81","—Yes. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",81
"82","4480. Were there small tenants there at one time ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",82
"83","—Yes, it was occupied by crofters. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",83

"87","—About fifteen years ago. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",87
"88","4483. Can you recollect when Kilbride was cleared?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",88
"89","—Yes, two years after I came to Strath —fifty-eight years ago. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",89
"90","4484. How long is it since the clearance took place at Suisnish and Boreraig?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",90
"91","—I think it would be in 1852 or thereabout. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",91

"93","—Yes. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",93

"108","4493. Are all these places—Ferrindonald, Ostaig, Linigary, and Carradale,— in the possession of Macdonald, Tormore?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",108
"109","—He has not Ferrindonald. He has Kilbeg, Ostaig, Linigary, Dalveil, Glencruig, and Gillen. He has Sleat from sea to sea. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",109
"110","4494. What number of people, have you any idea, were upon the farms occupied by Macdonald, Tormore, that you describe as going from sea to sea ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",110
"111","—It is long since I was that way, and I cannot say. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",111
"112","4495. Is there anybody but the shepherds, to the best of your belief, now on those farms ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",112
"113","—I am not aware that there is any one paying rent unless to himself. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",113
"114","4496. At whose instance were all those clearances; were they upon Lord Macdonald's estate ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",114
"115","—Yes. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",115
"116","4497. Who was the factor at the earliest period ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",116
"117","—Macpherson was the earliest one I can recollect. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",117
"118","4498. I suppose he was the person who was in charge when Suishnish was cleared ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",118
"119","—No. The present is the ninth factor under whom I have been, and the landlord is the fifth. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",119
"120","4499. I have mentioned some names. Do you know any other townships where you are aware that clearances have taken place in Sleat ? ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",120

"123","—Why were the people evicted from Boreraig and Suishnish ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",123

"125","4501. Were they all sent away?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",125
"126","—Yes. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",126
"127","4502. Were there not some well-doing crofters there ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",127

"129","4503. Very respectable people ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",129

"140","—Mr Scott, Drynoch, had it, and then the minister got it. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",140
"141","4509. Do you remember it being said that one of the reasons given for removing the people was that it was for their own good, because they were too far from the church ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",141
"142","—I remember hearing that said. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",142
"143","4510. How far is it from Broadford ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",143
"144","—Six miles. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",144
"145","4511. Do you know whether any people anywhere have got the offer of Suishnish and Boreraig to be given to six tenants this year ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",145

"147","4512. Who was factor when the people were evicted from the various places that Mr Fraser-Mackintosh asked about?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",147
"148","—Macpherson was the factor under whom the first evictions took place. Maxwell was the next. He did not remove any. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",148
"149","4513. Were any evicted in Tormore's time?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",149
"150","—Only those that were cleared off by him from Carradale when he added the township to his own tack. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",150

"156","4516. But the rent without taxes ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",156
"157","—£13, 10s. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",157
"158","4517. What stock have you?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",158
"159","—I have six cows and two horses and between forty and fifty sheep; that is the summing. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",159
"160","4518. I understood you to say you were satisfied with the schooling you got in your time, and that it was equal to what is now obtained. What are your own acquirements besides reading and writing ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",160
"161","—Arithmetic ; I can read English and Gaelic. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",161
"162","4519. You think the schooling is no better than it was, but no worse. Is that it ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",162
"163","—It is worse. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",163
"164","4520. So you pay more money for a worse article?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",164
"165","—In the school in which I was they would get English grammar and Latin taught, and there is no word of that in the present schools ; and they could get Greek too. The present schoolhouse cost £1000—for a little pimple of a woman. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",165
"166","4521. Do the people in this district approve generally of female teachers ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",166
"167","—Our female teacher is the only female teacher in our parish. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",167
"168","4522. Whether do you prefer a female teacher or a male teacher?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",168
"169","—I hear those who have children in the school say they would prefer a male teacher. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",169
"170","4523. Are you satisfied with your own rent?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",170
"171","—It is dear upon me. The feeding of my stock and my family, and providing with seed, costs me up to £30 per annum, beside the crop. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",171
"172","4524. Sheriff Nicolson.",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",172
"173","—One or two of the former witnesses spoke of sowing three bolls of corn and getting only one boll It seems natural to ask why they go on throwing away their corn. Have you any explanation of that ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",173
"174","—I do not know how other people's crops come on, but I can tell about my own. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",174
"175","4525. Is it because you value the fodder for your cattle more than the grain you can raise ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",175
"176","—Yes. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",176
"177","4526. Have you a right to sea-ware on the shore where you are ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",177
"178","—Yes, on our own shore. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",178
"179","4527. Have you plenty there ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",179
"180","—Some of them are not satisfied. They are taking sea-ware from others. They are taking sea-ware from the minister and Mr Bower. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",180
"181","4528. Has that been put a stop to ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",181
"182","—I am not aware that it is stopped yet ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",182
"183","4529. Have they been threatened with interdict if they go on taking away Mr Bower's ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",183
"184","—Yes, many a time. I never was obliged to take seawaro from anybody else, or any other place. I had a full share myself. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",184
"185","4530. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",185
"186","—You mentioned, though it was not translated, that you bought straw. Who are the people here who have straw to spare -At Breakish principally. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",186
"187","4531. Are they a crofter population at Breakish?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",187
"188","—Yes, their lots are larger than is required for the amount of stock they have. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",188
"189","4532. That is to say, their hill pasture is smaUer in proportion to their lots than it is in Torrin ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",189
"190","—Yes, very much more so. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",190
"191","4533. Do you pay for the sea-ware to the minister?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",191
"192","—I am not aware I ever paid a penny to the minister for sea-ware. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",192
"193","4534. Did he ever ask it from you ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",193
"194","—I never heard that the minister asked payment. When Mr Bower came first the people of our township offered to pay for the sea-ware, and he would not accept it, and the people then took the sea-ware. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",194
"195","4535. What docs Mr Bower do with the sea-ware ? Has he any used himself for the sea-ware ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",195
"196","—He uses it a little, but he does not need  much. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",196
"197","4536. In regard to the hill stock, is it in common]",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",197
"198","—Yes",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",198
"199","4537. Who manages it ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",199
"200","—We have two shepherds. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",200
"201","4538. Who buys and sells the stock ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",201
"202","—Ourselves.",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",202
"203","4539. Does every man do it ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",203
"204","—Two or three of our own number are elected each year as managers. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",204
"205","4540. At what time of the year do they make up their accounts ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",205
"206","—About Martinmas time. Every thing we have to sell is sold by that time. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",206
"207","4541. Do you know what the average profit of a share of the hill is— your own share ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",207
"208","—£10 per share. I have also to say the deer are troubling us very much. They are spoiling our crofts, and we must get protection against them, or else we cannot stand it. I was paying 5s. of dog tax to enable me to keep them off. The shooting tenant's gamekeeper came to the back of my house, and shot that dog about 50 yards off. The dog was lying beside my wife and daughter, who were lifting potatoes at the time. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",208
"209","4542. The Chairman.",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",209
"210","—Who was the shooting tenant?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",210
"211","—The Armstrongs, who had the shootings at Strolamus. They had the shooting over our hill too. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",211
"212","4543. Who was the gamekeeper who shot it?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",212
"213","—Robert Macgregor. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",213
"214","4544. Is he in the country now?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",214
"215","—No, I complained to the Fiscal about it, and the Fiscal could not recover payment of the value of the dog from the sportsman, because Tormore said I had no right to keep a dog. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",215
"216","4545. Did you ask the Fiscal to prosecute the gamekeeper ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",216
"217","—Yes, I put the case in the hands of the Fiscal, and the answer I got from the Fiscal was that the factor was saying I had no right to keep a dog, so nothing was done. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",217
"218","4546. Did the factor make you any allowance for a watcher to keep off the deer ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",218
"219","—Mr Mackmnon, the former factor, paid us during two years. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",219
"220","4547. How many years is it since you received any allowance to keep a watcher ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",220
"221","—Fourteen or fifteen years before Tormore came. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",221
"222","4548. Have you made many complaints for many years about the deer ? ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",222
"223","—Yes, and Tormore woidd answer me when I complained to him—' If you are not satisfied with what you have, throw it up.' ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",223
"224","4549. Do you know that a fence is going to be put up now?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",224
"225","—The factor is promising that, at any rate. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",225
"226","4550. What kind of fence would you prefer to have ? Would you prefer to have a solid stone dyke or an open wire fence?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",226
"227","—The stone dyke would last longer. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",227
"228","4551. Which is best for the arable land generally—a stone dyke or a wire fence ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",228
"229","—Neither of them would make much difference to the arable land. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",229
"230","4552. Do you think there ought to be a fence also round the hill pasture against the deer, or would you be satisfied with one round the arable?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",230
"231","—It would be very useful, but it would be a very long fence. There are mountains in it. ",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",231
"232","4553. How many miles long ?",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",232
"233","—Six miles, I think. It would indeed be useful to have it. Another thing that is causing us very much inconvenience, is the fact that two burns run through our grazing, and we have to cross these continually, and they are not bridged; and the beginning of this spring one of my neighbours was found drowned in one of them. I could only say that it is those who have the smallest holdings who complain most. A good deal of money came to this parish for the use of poor people, and because I had a whole croft I did not get a penny of it.",79,"Neil Nicolson","Skye, Broadford",233
