"20","John Mackay 4 acres for which he pays £6/6/0",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",20
"21","They hold of arable land from two to four acres, and pay of rent from £3, 7s. to £6, 6s. There are thirty-six acres rented in my district of arable land, for which we pay £58 and £9 of taxes—£67. The township yields in good years the average crop of forty-eight bolls of meal and 120 barrels of  potatoes. If whole produce were sold it should fetch £18 for potatoes and £33, 12s. for meal —in all £51, 12s., which is £6, 8s.less than we pay to the Duke for rent, and £15, 8s. whan taxes are counted. We buy of meal £13 worth to support our families every year; some years far more, but some less",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",21
"22","—this of an average. Rents were raised as follows :",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",22
"23","(1) I was paying £5, 5s. 4d. of road money; ",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",23
"24","(2) It was reduced to £4, 9s; ",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",24

"26","(4) 2s. 6d. taken off for the pier; ",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",26
"27","(5) Mr Crawford took off 3s. 3d.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",27
"28","—I can't tell why. I lost two crops within the last twelve years by a burn that runs through it. The proprietor refuses to protect my lot from the ravages of the stream; only he offers to do it on condition I pay interest on the money expended; which I think unreasonable because my rent is high. I pay",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",28
"29","now between taxes and rent £4, 16s. for scarce two acres. We petitioned the Duke for reduction of rent last November, on the ground that a storm damaged the corn crop, and that our potato crop was",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",29
"30","almost an entire failure; but we did not get as much as a reply to, or acknowledgment of receipt of, our petition.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",30
"31","—HECTOR MUNRO.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",31
"32","25707. Your rent is more than £2 an acre?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",32
"33","—Yes; I pay £2, 3s. 6½d of standing rent, forbye taxes, per acre.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",33
"34","25708. Is your land very fertile ?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",34
"35","—-Most of it is not —two inches of soil in some parts, and most of it solid rock.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",35
"36","25709. What crops are you able to raise?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",36
"37","—It cannot be very much for all that I have.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",37
"38","25710. Is it oats and potatoes entirely?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",38
"39","—Oats and here, but mostly potatoes.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",39
"40","25711. Does the land produce good crops?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",40
"41","—No; the third part will be good and the other part nothing at all",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",41
"42","25712. What sustenance does the croft afford to your family?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",42
"43","—I think one would be abundance to consume all that it would produce except potatoes; and when they are a failure I may say we have nothing at all upon it. When there is a good year we may have four bolls of bere-meal. I often keep two cows on the croft, but I have to buy food for them; and my neighbours in the whole township whom I represent here are similarly situated. I am about the worst of them.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",43
"44","25713. How much money are you obliged to spend in the whole year for the support of your family in buying meal and other food?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",44
"45","—I could spend more money than I have. If I had not good credit I could not do at all.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",45
"46","25714. Can you give any estimate of what you actually spend. How many bolls of meal do you buy?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",46
"47","—Four or five bolls, but our family is not big, there are only three of us just now. The people don't require so much just now, because they are nearly all away. They are scattered through all Scotland; all those who can earn anything are away from home just now.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",47
"48","25715. Are you surrounded by large farms in your parish?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",48
"49","—All the place is bordering with them. ",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",49
"50","25716. Is most of the parish occupied by large farms'?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",50
"51","—Yes, except round about the rocks, from one end of the parish to another, the same as if the crofts were a fence for keeping sheep and other beasts from the shore. ",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",51
"52","25717. How many big farms are there in the parish?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",52
"53","—Two and a half. There is one the half of which is in Durness and the other half in the parish of Tongue.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",53
"54","25718. How much of the land of the parish is occupied by these farms?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",54
"55","—Mostly the whole of it.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",55
"56","25719. You have only a little strip along the shore?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",56
"57","—Yes; and we have a little pasture, but the grass is no resource at all; we cut peats and divots for the houses.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",57
"58","25720. How many cows do you keep on your croft?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",58
"59","—I keep two cows, but I have to pay for them.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",59
"60","25721. Any sheep?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",60
"61","—About half a dozen. I think the whole township will scarcely average eight sheep. Some have none at all, and some two or three, and some more than that; but on an average I think perhaps about eight.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",61
"62","25722. Where is your hill pasture?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",62
"63","—It is adjoining the large farms.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",63
"64","25723. Is there a fence between you and them?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",64
"65","—No.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",65
"66","25724. Do their sheep come over to you?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",66
"67","—Yes, and ours go over to them; and we agree about that.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",67
"68","25725. Do they ever poind your sheep at all?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",68
"69","—No, I think not; they are not very hard upon us. We must give honour to whom honour is due.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",69
"70","25726. Would you like more land?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",70
"71","—Very likely the young people would, but not the like of me.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",71
"72","25727. Supposing you got additional land at a reasonable rent, something less than £2 an acre, would you like to take it?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",72
"73","—I would like to take it at less than £1 an acre. I think I pay too much rent. I think I have paid more than £50 to the Duke since fifty-five years; I have been paying rent above what I should, and the Duke is not a bit the richer for that.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",73
"74","25728. You say you petitioned the Duke last year for a reduction of your rent?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",74
"75","—This last spring.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",75
"76","25729. Was your corn crop destroyed by the storm?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",76
"77","—Yes, the most of it was destroyed and scattered away, a great deal of it.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",77
"78","25730. Was your potato crop bad?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",78
"79","—Yes; there was a great failure amongst the potatoes generally. The storm did not spoil the potatoes, but it spoiled the corn.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",79
"80","25731. Did you get any answer at all to your petition?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",80
"81","—Not yet.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",81
"82","25732. When did you send it?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",82
"83","—I think some time in November.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",83
"84","25733. Perhaps the Duke was not at home?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",84
"85","—I don't know if he was.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",85
"86","25731. How often does the post leave this?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",86
"87","—Twice a week.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",87
"88","25735. Then you ought to have got an answer before now?",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",88
"89","—Yes, long before.",430,"Hector Munro","Sutherland, Bettyhill",89
