"9","3575. Have you anything to add to what the former witness said?",60,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Waternish",9
"10","— There is plenty to say in addition if it would be of any use. We are not wanting much wealth, if we only could get a place where we could grow crops. But we are placed on land where we cannot grow crop,—soft, peaty land. It is two years since we sent anything to the mill to grind. Before then we may have been sending a little while there was strength in the ground. We think that if we could get a place in which we could grow a crop, we would be quite willing to pay a reasonable rent for it—if we could get a.place where we could work for ourselves, and improve ourselves. ",60,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Waternish",10
"11","3576. Is there any land near there which the proprietor could give you if he pleased, and where you could grow crop?",60,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Waternish",11
"12","—Yes, there is land. Our sheep are trespassing upon it, and being poinded, and we ourselves are quite willing to take it, and to pay for it. I mean land which is near us, which we never had before, which would grow crop, and which would answer our purpose. I do not say we are paying for it, but that we are willing to pay for it if we got it. ",60,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Waternish",12

"15","3578. What did he say?",60,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Waternish",15
"16","—He said at first that we would get it, and then that we would not. ",60,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Waternish",16
"17","3579. Has your present landlord ever raised your rent ?",60,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Waternish",17

"24","3582. How did the children get taught there?",60,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Waternish",24

"30","3585. Why did you not get a lad to teach them?",60,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Waternish",30
"31","—We spoke about that, but we were not thought of sufficient importance. ",60,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Waternish",31
"32","3586. To whom did you apply for a teacher?",60,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Waternish",32
"33","—The late Rev. Roderick M'Leod of Snizort. He told us he would try to get us a lad to teach our children. ",60,"Murdo Mclean","Skye, Waternish",33
