"3","—I believe you desire to make a statement on a particular point ?",503,"Charles James Murray","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",3
"4","—There was a point made by the inhabitants that the shingle is taken away from the south-east end of this village by the road commissioners and ships in search of ballast. By the removal of this shingle they consider these stances are endangered. Several high tides have occurred in the last few years, and one or two years ago they washed away the road in front of the village here; and they fear for the stances upon which their houses are built. They have complained, and there have been some local squabbles between them and the commissioners. I am not aware what steps have been taken in connection with the matter.",503,"Charles James Murray","Ross-shire, Shieldaig",4
