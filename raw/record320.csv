"11","17499. Then will you state it?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",11
"12","—The one thing we want is relief from the present overcrowding; and if land could be got to those who have it not, that would relieve in a great measure those who at present possess it. If things continue as they are, it is my firm belief that we are on the verge of extinction through poverty.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",12
"13","17500. Sheriff Nicolson.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",13

"35","—There is one man in that condition.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",35
"36","17511. Have the cottars auy cow or other stock ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",36

"51","—Five, and sometimes six.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",51
"52","17519. Do those boats belong to themselves?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",52

"56","17521. With all the nets?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",56
"57","—Without the nets. It is the boat with mast and sail, but without nets.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",57
"58","17522. Is it with the Stornoway curers that you deal?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",58
"59","—From everywhere.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",59
"60","17523. Is there any one in Maravaig who takes the fish from you?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",60
"61","—No, but they sometimes have a curing station for cod and ling. They used to have a curing station for herring, but the herring have left the place and they have withdrawn the station.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",61
"62","17524. What do you get for the fish ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",62
"63","—8d. and 10d. for a ling and 4d. and 6d. for a cod.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",63
"64","17525. Do they know what price they are to get for fish when they begin the fishing ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",64
"65","—Yes, we make our bargain at that time.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",65
"66","17526. Are they obliged to take meal or anything else instead of money from the curer ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",66
"67","—The man who is able to make his own purchases independently of the curer can go where he pleases to purchase, and the curer pays him in money.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",67
"68","17527. What do those curers charge for a boll of meal?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",68
"69","—I have not bought a boll of meal from the curers myself for a long time, but what I hear said is that the meal that is purchased for 20s. is given out on credit for 24s., and sometimes as high as 28s.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",69
"70","17528. Do the curers charge the same price ready money as other shops do ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",70

"72","17529. When do you know the price for the meal?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",72
"73","—Some know the price at the time they take away the meal, and some do not.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",73
"74","17530. When do you settle generally?#",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",74
"75","—There are different times at which these settlements are made. For the herring fishing they make a settlement before they go to the east coast fishing, but for the cod and ling fishing they very often make a settlement when they return from the east coast fishing, about the autumn.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",75
"76","17531. Do you keep pass-books?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",76
"77","—Many of them do. Many of them keep no account either of what they sell or buy. They have entirely to trust to the curer, only their own memory assists them more or less. ",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",77
"78","17532. Do they sometimes complain of mistakes being made?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",78
"79","—They sometimes do. ",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",79
"80","17533. The Chairman.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",80
"81","—Is there any land near which you could get to extend your present holdings ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",81
"82","—Nothing nearer than the Park.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",82
"83","17534. Does Park march with you?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",83
"84","—No, the townships of both Gravir and Garivard come in between us and the march with Park.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",84
"85","17535. Then all you want is that the cottars shall be removed, and a place found for them ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",85
"86","—Even if that were done, the place would not be comfortable unless some of the crofters were removed as well.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",86
"87","17536. How many of the crofters would you like to see removed?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",87
"88","—It would make perhaps twelve families comfortable.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",88
"89","17537. Then twenty-three would have to be removed ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",89
"90","—Yes, that is quite the case, before those who remained would be comfortably off.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",90
"91","17538. How long is it since the population there rose above twelve families ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",91
"92","—My memory does not go so far back; there were six lots originally.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",92
"93","17539. Were there not more than twelve families living on the place at the time of the allotment?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",93
"94","—It was made into twenty-three lots. I believe when it was in six lots there were two families to every lot, and I believe there were even more.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",94
"95","17540. How long is it since the school was built on the land taken from you ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",95
"96","—About four years ago.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",96
"97","17541. Have you lost that piece of your land for four years without having got a settlement about the rent ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",97
"98","—There have been four years, and there has not been a complete settlement of rent since that time.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",98
"99","17542. Was £ 2, 6s. the rent before any land was taken away for the schoolhouse ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",99
"100","—Yes.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",100
"101","17543. Do you think there has been any reduction made since that time?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",101
"102","—I heard I got 5s. of reduction. I heard that from my neighbour, who got 5s. of abatement for a bit that he lost in connection with the building of the schoolhouse.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",102
"103","17544. Did you never ask the factor whether you were to get any reduction ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",103
"104","—Well, the chamberlain and myself differed about the crops. I sowed the place after the site was marked out, because I did not know when the schoolhouse would be built, and I went with the rent and paid it, and I cropped it again, and I did not know that I was to be disturbed in any way uutil I could remove the crops from the ground. Then they came and cut down my crop. Well, I brought two constables to look at it, and they valued the damage at £ 4 , 10s. This was within the fence. Well, the chamberlain would pay me no portion of this amount. I then went to the contractor who built the school. I asked him if he would pay me. He said it was the chamberlain who ought to pay that amount,—was I so blind as to think it was his business to pay it,—that it was his duty to pay for a school site for them ? That was the cause of the difference with respect to the rent.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",104
"105","17545. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",105
"106","—With regard to the surplus people here, are they willing to pay a fair rent if they got a piece of the Park ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",106
"107","—I don't think that anybody would expect anything else than to pay a reasonable rent.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",107
"108","17546. Would they expect the proprietor to do anything additional in the way of buildings or otherwise, if they got suitable places ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",108
"109","—So far as I judge, I don't know that they have much expectation of that from the proprietrix.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",109
"110","17547. Would they be willing to do that at their own cost if they got a suitable places at a moderate rent ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",110
"111","—Yes, they would.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",111
"112","17548. The Chairman. ",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",112
"113","—What do you mean by a reasonable rent ? Do you mean such a rent as the sheep farmer pays ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",113
"114","—So far as I have heard of the rents that the sheep farmers pay, I believe that the crofters would be willing to pay an equal rent",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",114
"115","17549. Would they consider it a reasonable rent?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",115
"116","—I can only speak for myself in that matter. My own view would be to value the land, and have a reasonable rent placed upon it by people appointed by both the proprietor and Government.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",116
"117","17550. Mr Cameron.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",117
"118","—What would you do with all the high land in the interior of the farm in that event ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",118
"119","—I don't think that the people would covet it. They would leave it with the deer as they had it of old.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",119
"120","17551. Do you think the tacksman would covet it either if the low land was taken away ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",120
"121","—Well, the fact is that I was myself for a long time in this Park, and I saw that the sheep and deer herded there together, and the people were paying their own rent in proportion to the amount of ground they occupied. [Question repeated.] I don't think the tacksman would covet the place without having the up-lands as well as the low land. ",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",121
"122","17552. But would he take the up-land without the low land?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",122
"123","—I cannot say, but my opinion is that he would.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",123
"124","17553. But you said just now that you would not covet it?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",124
"125","—It is he who would covet the hills if only he got low land as well.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",125
"126","17554. The Chairman.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",126
"127","—How would you propose to utilise the high land if the crofters only took the low land ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",127
"128","—The former tenants of Park were very well off when they had the up-land as well as the low land. Aldinish, of which you have spoken, was a small township. There were only three tenants in it, and when they left it they took away twentythree cows each out of it.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",128
"129","17555. Then do you think the crofters would be willing to take the uplands as well as the low lands at the present rent ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",129
"130","—That is a hard question, but if once they got upon their feet they would be glad to do so; I mean if they got assistance.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",130
"131","17556. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",131
"132","—As you were in Park, can you give us the names of some of the cleared townships that have not been already enumerated ? Do you know Caolas-an-eilan ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",132
"133","—Yes.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",133
"134","17557. Smosivig?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",134
"135","—Yes.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",135
"136","17558. Bunachoreavig ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",136

"141","—I don't know the west side.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",141

"148","17564. Sgealadale-more ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",148
"149","—Yes.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",149
"150","17565. Amdh-Dhoill-chaim?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",150
"151","—Yes.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",151
"152","17566. Ceanmore?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",152
"153","—Yes.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",153
"154","17567. Chulcbreag ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",154
"155","—Yes.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",155
"156","17568. Can you give us any more that were cleared ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",156
"157","—The shepherd with whom I was employed would name at least thirty.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",157
"158","17569. Have you any idea what number of people were removed?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",158
"159","—I have no idea.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",159
"160","17570. Would there be 100?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",160
"161","—I believe there would be, but I have no knowledge whatever of the west side.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",161
"162","17571. Is there any person living who knows ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",162
"163","—No.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",163
"164","17572. Professor Mackinnon.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",164
"165","—You have said that you went to the contractor who built the school and asked him if he would pay you, and that he said it was the chamberlain who ought to pay you, and that it was not his (the contractor's), business to do so ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",165
"166","—Yes.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",166
"167","17573. Now we understand from that evidence that the contractor gave you no money ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",167
"168","—He gave me no money, and he said it was not he who ought to supply me with money.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",168
"169","17574. Do you say distinctly that you got no money for the crop from the contractor who built the school ?",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",169
"170","—Nothing.",320,"Roderick Finlayson","Lewis, Keose",170
