"32","—The last time I believe I spent £12 on it. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",32

"35","2702. What kind of house is it?",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",35

"42","—If we had a quay in any convenient place where it could be built. We have no boat that we could use at times when they should be used at sea, for its size must be such that four men can carry it up the beach as soon as it touches. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",42
"43","2706. If you had a quay or pier, would the fishermen be disposed to pay some small sum of money for the use of it, if the Government built it ?",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",43
"44","—Yes, well might they do it indeed. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",44

"50","—We would. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",50
"51","2709. Can you suggest anything else that the Government or any other parties could do to improve your fishing trade ?",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",51
"52","—Yes, helping to buy the boats and nets; only, we would need a place for them. They could buy such boats and nets if they got such assistance. These would be of no use to us without a place where we would draw them up. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",52
"53","2710. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",53

"72","—10s. 6d. a week, and a percentage on the fish caught. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",72

"76","—Beginning at this time to the end of August. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",76
"77","2721. Professor Mackinnon.",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",77
"78","—Do you say you make 10s. 6d. a week and £10 or £14 in addition ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",78

"87","—Yes. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",87
"88","2725. That employs you for four months, what else do you do ?",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",88

"101","—Yes, if we went out. We don't fish much beyond what we need for our families, for we cannot yet a market for our fish here. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",101
"102","2732. Then for five months you only fish for your families?",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",102
"103","—Yes, that is all. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",103
"104","2733. What can you make out of the spring lobster fishing?",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",104
"105","—Some years better than others. Some years from £18 to £20 each of the four of us in the boat, but we have to take our fishing tackle out of that. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",105
"106","2734. How many barrels of potatoes are you able to get from the land in the year for use ?",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",106

"113","—What do you complain of personally in your circumstances ?",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",113
"114","—Want of land out of which we can make a living, without the necessity of going to sea. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",114
"115","2738. Would yon prefer to be a small crofter rather than go to sea ?",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",115
"116","— Yes, but it is not a small croft we would need. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",116
"117","2739. I presume your circumstances have not fallen off of late years, and that your income is usually as good as it was twenty years ago ?",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",117
"118","— Some years my earnings are more than others. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",118
"119","2740. The Chairman.",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",119
"120","—We have heard a great deal of crofters becoming poorer and poorer. Do you think that those who depend chiefly or almost entirely upon the sea are also becoming poorer, or do you think they maintain the same or a better condition?",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",120
"121","—We believe we are getting poorer, like them. The place in which we are is so straitened. We are crowded into a space of one mile between two tacks, on which there are twenty-three families of us, without land, and the smallest family consists of three, and the largest of eleven. There are thirty-six crofters besides on that strip of a mile, and the place must needs be poor. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",121
"122","2741. I don't wish to ask you about the crofters, but I don't understand why the position of the fishermen, who do not depend upon the land, is becoming poorer and poorer, when wages have become higher and higher, and they have no rent to pay ?",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",122
"123","—I cannot say we are getting poorer in that way, but that we cannot get the land. We cannot be more prosperous at the fishing. ",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",123
"124","2742. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",124
"125","—Suppose you got a croft—and you say you would need a pretty big one—at a moderate rent, would it be better to take to that, than to continue a fisherman, with the benefit of having a pier, and with assistance, which you could pay back in instalments, for the purchase of boats, nets, and tackle ?",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",125
"126","—If we could get a good croft, as I was referring to, we would try and carry on both businesses. I have a family enough at home who would use the boat at the fishing.",44,"Roderick Mcinnes","Skye, Stenscholl",126
