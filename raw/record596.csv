"7","—'We have to complain that our rent has been raised from £54 to £100 per annum at the expiry of our lease in 1864, by our present proprietor. In 1874 our rent was raised £ 8 more for additional hill pasture. Under the present proprietor we have no claim for houses built or other improvements in the event of our leaving. We get no wood for fences or houses about the farm unless paid for; no improvements on our land in any form. Our stock of cattle is four cows and one horse to every lot. The farm is divided into six lots, but there are only five tenants; two of them have three lots. Our stock of sheep is 300. In 1840 a part of our best pasture was taken from us—about 120 acres. Our rent was at that time £71 per annum, as our rent book can prove. We get no work on the estate of any kind.' Signed by CHARLES CAMERON, and by four others.",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",7

"10","35979. Have they each a separate croft ?",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",10

"13","—Mr John James Dalgleish of Ardnamurchan.",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",13

"22","35985. What reason was given by the landlord for this sudden advance of rent ?",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",22
"23","—There was no reason given ; but if we could not pay the rent we would have to go.",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",23
"24","35986. What extent of ground was given?",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",24
"25","—About fifteen acres of moss land ; it was entirely uncultivated land. I wish to say that this piece of land we got before belonged to us originally; and although we got it back at that time we had to pay £ 8 additional.",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",25
"26","35987. Was it a part of the 120 acres which had been taken from you ?",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",26

"36","35992. Does the lot keep the four cows and one horse, or have you to buy any winter keep ?",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",36
"37","—The lots are not sufficient to support the summing we have; we have to buy a lot of food for our cattle in winter.",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",37
"38","35993. What is the rent of each lot ?",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",38

"46","35997. It has been in the form of a club farm all that time ?",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",46

"57","—I should explain that there is one chosen to go and sell the stock, and whatever he gets we are all agreeable to it.",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",57
"58","36003. What may be the gross amount of the sale of stock and wool on the farm in a year ?",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",58
"59","—We generally get as much for the wool as pays for the smearing of the sheep, and sometimes a little over, according to the state of the market; and we sell perhaps thirty or forty lambs and a few aged sheep at the end of the season.",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",59
"60","36004. What has been done with the hill pasture that has been taken from you; was it added to the farm, or is it in the hands of the proprietor?",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",60

"68","36008. Would you be in favour of dividing the crofts into smaller portions, or do you think they should be left as they are ?",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",68
"69","—We do not wish the holdings to be made small ; what we complain of principally is that the rent is exorbitant.",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",69
"70","36009. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",70
"71","—What is the acreage of your arableland ?",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",71

"95","—I know of nothing.",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",95

"106","36026. What is the condition of people of your class upon the estate; are they poor, or are they comfortable?",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",106
"107","—They are very far back in that respect; the houses are very bad,",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",107
"108","36027. And your condition generally is unsatisfactory ?",596,"Charles Cameron","Argyll, Lochaline",108
