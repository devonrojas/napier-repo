"1","JOHN MACDONALD, Crofter, Tockaveg (48)—examined. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",1
"2","5580. The Chairman.",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected by the people of Tockaveg ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",3
"4","—Yes. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",4
"5","5581. The statement from Tockaveg is :",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",5
"6","—' The complaint here is that the tenants continue to pay interest for borrowed money for drains after the proper time for relieving them had expired Another great complaint is that, some years ago, the rents were considerably raised on lots which the tenants had greatly improved entirely by their own labour. The increase of rent amounted, in some cases, to £1 , 12s., consequently they are deterred from further improvements for fear of their rents being raised. It might be explained that, in the cases where no improvements were effected, the increase of rent was not so great They desire it also to be stated that their land is run out, and not nearly so productive as in former years. It was agreed that Alexander Macdonald and John Macdonald be appointed delegates from Tockaveg.' Have you anything to add to that statement ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",6
"7","—Not much. The principal cause of my complaint is the increase that was put on our rents, especially on my own rent. I was feeling it most. I consider my rent was increased greater than that of any other lot. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",7
"8","5582. What is the size of your croft, and the summing ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",8
"9","—It was only a disordered place, the ground being full of holes, and rocks, and trees. I cannot tell the acreage of it. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",9
"10","5583. What is the summing?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",10
"11","—Three cows and a two-year-old, and twelve sheep anil a horse. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",11
"12","5584. What is the present rent without the public burdens?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",12
"13","—£5, 4s. Eight or nine years ago, I was only paying £4, 7s. 6d. Sixteen or seventeen shillings of increase was then made on my rent. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",13
"14","5585. Will you explain the nature of the improvements you made upon the croft ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",14
"15","—Draining; I myself draining it without any remuneration. Besides that, I am paying the interest of the former drainage money that was got from the landlord. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",15
"16","5586. As to the drainage you made yourself, was it upon some ground that was drained by the Government money, or upon different ground",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",16
"17","—The drainage I made myself was upon ground which had been previously drained. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",17
"18","5587. What kind of drains did you put in ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",18
"19","—Stone drains. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",19
"20","5588. How long ago is it since you made these improvements ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",20
"21","—Some of them this spring itself; and if I was not improving my lot in that way, I might not put down any crop at all. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",21
"22","5589. Has your rent been increased since you made any of these improvements yourself ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",22
"23","—Yes. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",23
"24","5590. How long ago is it since you made your first improvements?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",24
"25","—About thirteen or fourteen years ago, when I got the croft. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",25
"26","5591. How long after the period of your improvements was the first increase put on ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",26
"27","—I think seven or eight years after that. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",27
"28","5592. Did the factor come over and see these improvements?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",28
"29","—Never. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",29
"30","5593. How do you know that it was in consequence of your improvements that the rent was raised ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",30
"31","—I do not think it was in consequence of the improvements, but according to his own conscience. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",31
"32","5591. How many years does your memory go back as a crofter?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",32
"33","—I cannot very well say. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",33
"34","5595. Do you remember back twenty years?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",34
"35","—Yes, I remember some things very well. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",35
"36","5596. For what price did you sell a stirk twenty years ago ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",36
"37","—Various prices. The price of stock does not last long at the same figure. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",37
"38","5597. But what was the average price ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",38
"39","—I cannot be very sure. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",39
"40","5598. Was it less or more than it would be now ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",40
"41","—I believe the prices were less then than they are to-day. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",41
"42","5599. And the same for sheep ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",42
"43","—Yes, I think so. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",43
"44","5600. If the prices of the cattle and the sheep have, in that time, risen very much or a good deal, do you consider it very unjust that there should be a slight increase of rent?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",44
"45","—No, I do not think it unjust so to increase the rent if the good prices should continue, but what is entered into the landlord's books lasts. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",45
"46","5601. Did you ever hear of a reduction of rent in consequence of prices falling?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",46
"47","—No, never. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",47
"48","5602. Have you not heard of such a thing in connection with the large farms—with the tacksmen ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",48

"54","—Was the £5, Is. exclusive of the interest on the Government drainage money ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",54

"56","5602. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",56
"57","—To whom did you speak ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",57
"58","—To the present factor. I knew by him that lie would rather increase my rent. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",58
"59","5606. You got no satisfaction, in fact?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",59
"60","—No. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",60

"65","—Yes. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",65
"66","5609. How many of the eight ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",66
"67","—Every one of them had his rent raised. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",67
"68","5610. Have they all made improvements?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",68
"69","—Yes. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",69
"70","5611. How does your rent stand by that of your neighbours—is it higher or lower ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",70
"71","—My rent is smaller than that of my neighbours, or the other lots are larger than mine. I felt the increase on my rent more because it was an increase on me. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",71
"72","5612. Professor Mackinnon.",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",72
"73","—Did you observe that the rent was raised more upon those who improved most ?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",73

"75","5613. The paper says so.",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",75
"76","—You may leave it as it is in the paper. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",76

"78","—We continued working all the same. ",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",78
"79","5615. The increase of rent was not greater than the increase in the value of the land?",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",79
"80","—We are of opinion that the land is dear at any rate, for a crop does not grow on it. I have to buy the seed with which to sow it.",107,"John Macdonald","Skye, Isle Ornsay",80
