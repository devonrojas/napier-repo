"1","DUNCAN MACKENZIE, Crofter, Reef (76) —examined.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",1
"2","27993. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",2
"3","—Have you any statement to make?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",3
"4","—Yes.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",4
"5","The petition of the Crofters residing in Reef, Coigach, in the Parish of Lochbroom, unto the Royal Commissioners, Highlands and Islands,",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",5
"6","—Humbly sheweth,",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",6
"7","—That there are about forty young men, residing in Reef, who are experienced fishermen, and are able and willing to work at sea, but who are prohibited from doing so, by want of proper boats and fishing material, and by the want of any suitable local harbour: That there is abundance of fish near the coast, indeed it is believed that there is not a better fishing station between Cape Wrath and Gairloch Head: That most of the men are the support of their parents, and are at present bravely striving with their small boats and poor material to keep their parents from becoming a burden on the parish. We therefore most humbly solicit that you would use your influence with Her Majesty's Government so that they would advance to us good substantial boats and fishing material at a stated rate of interest, and giving us a stated time to repay the outlay; and also that a small harbour would be erected so as to enable us to land our fish in safety. By doing so an inestimable benefit would be conferred, not only on the inhabitants of Reef, but also on the inhabitants of the west coast generally",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",7
"8","27994. Were you appointed a delegate by the inhabitants of Reef?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",8
"9","—Yes.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",9
"10","27995. How many were present at the time you were appointed?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",10
"11","—About a dozen of them. The people are not at home just now; they are away but they left their mandate with us.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",11
"12","27996. How many crofters are there in the township you represent?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",12
"13","—About twenty who pay rent.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",13
"14","27997. Any cottars ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",14
"15","—Four.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",15
"16","27998. Altogether I suppose you represent about one hundred people?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",16
"17","—Yes, probably about one hundred.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",17
"18","27999. Have you any statement to make over and above what is in the paper ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",18
"19","—What I, as an old man, have to complain of chiefly is, that the rent has been increased, and this in consequence of our own improvements upon the land. Our township paid a rent of £60, and for the last three years we have been paying £80. Now I am an old man and I have no family—they have taken wing and flown away —they were not of such a kind as would remain in the place. I kept a horse before the rent was raised, and they made me pay for the horse separately from the rent. Now they have combined the rent of the horse with the rent of the land. I pay now £ 1 for the grazing of a horse in another place, in Assynt at Knockan, and the factor here compels me to pay £1 on the croft. The place is contracted and is not suitable for grazing a horse in summer",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",19
"20","28000. What is your rent now?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",20
"21","—£4.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",21
"22","28001. Does that include the pound for the horse ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",22
"23","—The £4 includes the horse ; and there are the rates in addition.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",23
"24","28002. How long have you been a crofter yourself?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",24
"25","—Nearly fifty years.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",25
"26","28003. When you began what rent were you paying ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",26
"27","—£2, 10s.  ",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",27
"28","28004. Have you got the same land and the same privileges of hill pasture that you had fifty years ago when you began ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",28
"29","—Yes, but it is a bad place; it is rocky and stony ground, and I expended a great deal of labour upon it blasting the rocks.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",29
"30","28005. Have you been during the last forty years improving and trying to develop the resources of your croft to the utmost ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",30
"31","—Yes.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",31
"32","28006. And the result has been all added to your rent ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",32
"33","—Yes, the man that improves best will have his rent increased most.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",33
"34","28007. There seems to have been a rise of rent on the property; did anybody go about valuing the places ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",34
"35","—Only our own factors.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",35
"36","28008. They are quite able themselves to raise the rent without calling in other people?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",36
"37","—Yes, quite; I did not happen to be at home at the time; I was at Caithness fishing when the valuation was made.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",37
"38","28009. Are your houses in pretty good order?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",38
"39","—They would be none the worse of being better.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",39
"40","28010. Have you kept them up yourself all the time you have been tenant?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",40
"41","—Yes, it was myself that erected them and kept them up afterwards, I paid for the masons and took some of the timber from Wick and from Inverness and Loch Hourn.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",41
"42","28011. Did you ever get any assistance in the way of money, or timber, or lime from the proprietor ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",42
"43","—Not a penny.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",43
"44","28012. May your case be called a typical one of the rest of the crofters, or did they get any help ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",44
"45","—So far as I am aware their condition in that respect is the 6ame; I am not aware that they ever asked any assistance.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",45
"46","28013. When the rent was raised from £60 to £80 on the township three years ago, did you get anything directly or indirectly in the way of extension?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",46
"47","—Nothing whatever; I would not even get an ounce of powder to blast the rocks. I did not ask the pasture, but what I asked I did not get.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",47
"48","28014. What did you ask?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",48
"49","—There is no occasion to tell.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",49
"50","28015. Are the cottars a burden to the crofters to some extent?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",50
"51","—They must needs be. But if they are able to have a cow they will have a cow; and if they can afford to buy a sheep they will have a sheep, and they need potato ground and other conveniences.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",51
"52","28016. Do they pay any rent to the township in money or labour?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",52
"53","—I am not aware.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",53
"54","28017. Does the township pay poor rates?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",54
"55","—Yes.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",55
"56","28018. Do I understand that besides paying poor rates they have these four families entirely to support also ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",56
"57","—They make their livelihood someway. The whole of their livelihood is not by any means dependent on us; if that were the case they would be hungry indeed.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",57
"58","28019. Is there any land near them convenient, which might be added to their ground ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",58
"59","—There are other tenants coming in between us and the large farm of Baden Tarbet.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",59
"60","28020. In order to make the people comfortable at Reef it would be necessary to transport some of them elsewhere?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",60
"61","—Yes, that would be necessary, but I am not sure that they would be willing to emigrate. The younger ones have to support their parents.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",61
"62","28021. I mean to emigrate to Baden Tarbet there?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",62
"63","—They would be exceedingly glad to go there; that is suitable land for rearing people, and not ours. Our land is rock and moss.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",63
"64","28022. Can you ever be comfortable in these circumstances as long as you remain in your present crippled and confined state?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",64
"65","—No; that is the reason why they ask for assistance to enable them to take their livelihood out of the sea.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",65
"66","28023. Sheriff Nicolson.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",66
"67","—What kind of harbour have you at present ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",67
"68","—It is a bad harbour in winter.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",68
"69","28024. What wind blows into it?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",69
"70","—The south-west wind",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",70
"71","28025. Is there no safe creek into which you can take your boats ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",71
"72","—No.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",72
"73","28026. What do you do with them ? Have you to haul them up on the grass ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",73
"74","—To be sure.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",74
"75","28027. Is there a good place on your shore where a pier or breakwater could be made ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",75
"76","—It could be done very well at considerable expense. There are plenty of stones.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",76
"77","28028. Have you not made any kind of little quay for your own convenience?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",77
"78","—Yes, there is a sort of quay.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",78
"79","28029. Would it be very expensive to make a better one ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",79
"80","—That would depend upon the amount of labour which would be expended upon it.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",80
"81","28030. Has every house-holder there got a boat?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",81
"82","—Almost all of them have.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",82
"83","28031. They have no large boats of the sort they have on the East coast ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",83
"84","—Yes there are some ; one that I had myself is still there, and there is another one.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",84
"85","28032. Where did you get that boat ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",85
"86","—In Wick.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",86
"87","28033. What did it cost ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",87
"88","—£80.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",88
"89","28034. And did you pay that for the boat yourself ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",89
"90","—Yes.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",90
"91","28035. How did you make the money ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",91
"92","— By the sea, not by the land.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",92
"93","28036. If all these forty young men and their successors at Reef had good boats and sufficient gear, do you think they could live by the fishing ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",93
"94","—They would try whatever.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",94
"95","28037. Do you think they could do it without the land ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",95
"96","—I am not sure. The land is for the old people and the sea for the young men.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",96
"97","28038. I suppose they could not get on well unless they had milk to give their children, for which one cow at least is necessary ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",97
"98","—They would be the better of that.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",98
"99","28039. And they would rather raise their own potatoes than be buying them ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",99
"100","—Surely.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",100
"101","28040. Are they able to raise potatoes enough just now to support their families ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",101
"102","—Not by any means.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",102
"103","28041. Was there a total failure of your crop last year ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",103
"104","— The wind swept away the crops, and the storm destroyed the potatoes.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",104
"105","28042. Are your own circumstances worse just now than they were when you were young?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",105
"106","—Yes, as my family left me —that is the reason of it; and my strength ebbed away.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",106
"107","28043. Where have they all gone away to?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",107
"108","—Some of them died, and the females married.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",108
"109","28044. Are you able to get enough out of your own croft to support you ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",109
"110","—No, it is by the horse I am taking home the peats, I am not able to carry any burden.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",110
"111","28045. Does your ground supply you with food enough ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",111
"112","—No.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",112
"113","28046. How are you able to pay for the meal and the things you buy?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",113
"114","—It is by the stock, and by the credit this year.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",114
"115","28047. What can you make by selling beasts in a good year?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",115
"116","—I got £5 or £6 for a good beast.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",116
"117","28048. Is that the most ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",117
"118","—This year £ 8 if it is a good beast,",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",118
"119","28049. Have you any sheep ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",119
"120","—Yes.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",120
"121","28050. How many ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",121
"122","—Indeed I have not many sheep.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",122

"124","—I know fine.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",124
"125","28052. How many ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",125

"128","—Yes, I sold three this year.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",128
"129","28054. What did you get for them ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",129
"130","—£1 for the three.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",130
"131","28055. What kind were they, black-faced ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",131
"132","—Just that",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",132
"133","28056. Do you sell wool also ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",133
"134","—1 sold the wool with them.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",134
"135","28057. Do you ever in your place make clothes out of vour own wool ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",135
"136","—Yes.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",136
"137","28058. Do a good many of them do that ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",137
"138","—Yes, a good many.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",138
"139","28059. Have you weavers ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",139
"140","—Very rarely now.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",140
"141","28060. Had the people better clothes when you were young or worse ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",141
"142","—The young people will get good clothes.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",142
"143","28061. But are the people generally better clothed than when you were young ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",143
"144","—They are.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",144
"145","28062. I suppose when you were young a good many of the men would go bare-footed ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",145
"146","—Very few.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",146
"147","28063. Do you think the clothes they buy are as good as those they made ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",147
"148","—I think not.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",148
"149","28064. Are the children better clothed than they used to be ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",149
"150","—I don't know that.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",150
"151","28065. Are any of them so poorly clothed that they have some delicacy or difficulty in going to school?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",151
"152","—Indeed, yes.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",152

"158","28068. Were the potatoes very much better before that, than they are now ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",158
"159","—Yes, very much better. We had a kind of potatoes then, that I don't see now at all.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",159
"160","28069. Was that a great advantage to the people then, and have they suffered much in consequence of the disease ?",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",160
"161","—The people at that time lived more upon potatoes than they do now; even supposing they had potatoes now, they would not consider it good diet.",467,"Duncan Mackenzie","Ross-shire, Ullapool",161
