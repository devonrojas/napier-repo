"1","DONALD M'KINNON, Crofter, Hallistra (51)—examined. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",1
"2","2958. The Chairman.",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",2
"3","—How long have you been upon your croft ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",3
"4","—I am twenty years paying rent. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",4
"5","2959. On the same croft ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",5
"6","—Not on the same croft. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",6
"7","2960. Have you been freely selected as a delegate of the people of Hallistra ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",7
"8","—Yes, it is they who sent me here. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",8
"9","2961. Who is the proprietor?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",9
"10","—Captain Macdonald. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",10
"11","2962. Will you be so good as to state what the hardships and grievances are of which the people complain whom you represent?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",11
"12","—That we are confined to small crofts, and that we have no place on which to graze our cows other than at tether. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",12
"13","2963. How are they grazed at tether?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",13
"14","—It has a peg at the one end. We would like to have a bit of hill pasture for our cows, if we could get it. The crofts which we have have been cultivated incessantly for the past eighty or one hundred years, and are now exhausted. We cannot keep horses. We have no grazing for them, and we have to do the harrowing ourselves. I need to use a double quantity of seed in sowing my land, the land is so bad. I have no further complaint to make. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",14
"15","2964. Is there any complaint about sea-weed ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",15
"16","—We get a little sea-weed for payment. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",16
"17","2965. Can you suggest anything that could be done to improve your condition besides what you have said?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",17
"18","—I think if we had more land that would enable us to rest what we have been continuously cultivating. We would not require much (see Appendix A. VII)",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",18
"19","2966. How about the road? Is there a road about this place or near this place ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",19
"20","—The road passes my house. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",20
"21","2967. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",21
"22","—How many people are in the township you represent ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",22
"23","—Nine crofters, and the Captain's herd. These nine pay rent. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",23
"24","2968. Are they all in the same position as yourself ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",24
"25","—Yes, very much. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",25
"26","2969. You want more land. Is there land convenient which this township could get from the laird?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",26
"27","—Yes, above our houses; the land which our forefathers had. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",27
"28","2970. Has that place a name ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",28
"29","—Upper Hallistra. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",29
"30","2971. How long ago was this taken from you?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",30
"31","—About forty-two or forty-three years ago, when the township was divided into lots. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",31
"32","2972. Was that in the time of the present family?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",32
"33","—In the time of Major Macdonald, Captain Macdonald's father. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",33
"34","2973. Have the people asked the present laird at any time to get that hill back?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",34
"35","—We asked it once or twice. We have done so this year. We have repeatedly spoken for an addition to our lots and grazing. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",35
"36","2974. And what was the answer?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",36
"37","—He did not give us any encouragement that we would get it. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",37
"38","2975. In whose possession is it at this moment ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",38
"39","—In his own possession, under sheep and cattle. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",39
"40","2976. I understand you to say you are not complaining of the rent?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",40
"41","— The rent is very high for all that we can keep. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",41
"42","2977. When was it last raised1?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",42
"43","—To the best of my recollection, it is the same rent still which is laid on the crofts. The present landlord did not raise the rent at any rate. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",43
"44","2978. Is your present township near where we are now sitting?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",44
"45","— Within two miles of it. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",45
"46","2979. Are you on the shore?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",46
"47","—Yes. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",47
"48","2980. Are they generally fishermen ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",48
"49","—The most. We would be fishing when there was nothing else to do. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",49
"50","2981. There is a harbour here which we have seen this morning— a nice little place, which does not seem to be much used; what is the reason of that ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",50
"51","—That is a port which the captain built for his own boats, but he does not prevent anybody else from using it. They have full liberty to use it. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",51
"52","2982. Is there any other landing place ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",52
"53","—There is a small quay they are working at. The fishermen land at the upper quay. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",53
"54","2983. It is not a protection for boats to lie in, is it?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",54
"55","—No. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",55
"56","2984. Is there a good deal of fish got in this bay here ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",56
"57","—At one time a good deal of fish was got in the bay, but for some time past it has been going past. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",57
"58","2985. We hear in every place we go to the same story that fish were once got, but now they are scarce. Can you give any explanation of that ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",58
"59","—I cannot explain it, but I think it is the hand of Providence. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",59
"60","2986. You are not able to assign any cause yourself?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",60
"61","—No. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",61
"62","2987. What is the extent of your arable ground?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",62
"63","—About 5 or 6 acres of all sorts, but there is part of it under the name of land which is not cultivatable. It would cost from £12 to £8 an acre to trench it to make it good land. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",63
"64","2988. How much are you actually cultivating now?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",64
"65","—I think about 4 acres. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",65
"66","2989. Have you ever thought of improving that land, if it is capable of improvement ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",66
"67","—Yes, I have thought of that. Money would improve it. Some of the stones would take four or five men, as strong as myself, to lift them. I would need 100 or 200 barrels of gunpowder to clean the lot ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",67
"68","2990. Then, you think that land practically is not capable of improvement ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",68
"69","—It is, by spending money on it. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",69
"70","2991. But, practically, it is not capable of improvement?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",70
"71","—It would not pay for a long time to come. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",71
"72","2992. Mr Cameron.",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",72
"73","—Do you speak of the land of your own croft, or does the same apply to your neighbours ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",73
"74","—Most of my neighbours' crofts are in the same state. I think my own lot is as bad as another with stones. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",74
"75","2993. So, in fact, there is no land capable of improvement so as to add to the arable acreage of your croft, or your neighbours' crofts ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",75
"76","—No. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",76
"77","—I am there twenty-six years paying rent, and it is two cows I am able to keep, and the grazing is scant enough for them",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",77
"78","—mostly on the tether, and starving. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",78
"79","2995. Is that the case with your neighbours in the township ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",79
"80","—They are not much better. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",80
"81","2996. But two cows is what they keep?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",81
"82","—Some of them are keeping only one cow. When I have a young beast I am obliged to sell it at the end of the year, having no grass for it. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",82
"83","2997. What is your rent?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",83
"84","—£7, 15s. of bare rent; £8, 10s. with  rates. _ ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",84
"85","2998. Are you and your neighbours in poor circumstances ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",85
"86","—Poor enough. There may be one man who has a cow, and five perhaps may be claiming it. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",86
"87","2999. You mean he has borrowed money upon it ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",87
"88","—No, but we are getting meal from the merchants in Glasgow, and shoemakers, and rent, and everything. It may be that five may be claiming an interest in that cow and the value of the cow not able to pay them. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",88
"89","3000. Is that the case generally amongst your neighbours in the township ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",89
"90","—Yes, they are mostly in debt. In families in which there may be four young men working, even these may have enough to do to clear their families. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",90
"91","3001. Since when did that state of things begin ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",91
"92","—Since the potato failure. People have been poor ever since the land has been lotted, and the pasture taken. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",92
"93","3002. Has it been getting greatly worse within the last few years, or has this state of things been constant ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",93
"94","—We were poor enough, but this year has sunk us entirely in debt. We were poor enough before, so poor that we could not get a boll of meal on credit. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",94
"95","3003. And this year has been the worst ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",95
"96","—Yes. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",96
"97","3004. Do you account for that in any measure by the loss of the grazing forty years ago ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",97
"98","—We were not, certainly, the better of the deprivation of the hill. We need to sell the stirk at a year old, having no place to keep it in. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",98
"99","3005. Is your arable ground sufficient to winter more cattle if you had grazing for them in summer?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",99
"100","—I might be able to winter another beast",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",100
"101","— a two-year-old ; but if I had more land I would be able to bring in another bit under cultivation. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",101
"102","3006. Now, will you explain exactly what you mean by the tethering ? ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",102
"103","—The place is so confined, and the corn is so close to where we have to graze them, that we must have them tethered, otherwise they would be in our corn. There is no room to feed them otherwise. When they see the corn and the grass, and they hungry, there would be no keeping them back without the tether. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",103
"104","3007. Could you not drive them to the hill in the morning, and leave them there ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",104
"105","—We have no hill at all. The laird has a dyke to the roadside. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",105
"106","3008. Where do you tether your cows?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",106
"107","—On our crofts, on that part of our arable land which we leave out for grass. Part of our ground is so bad that it will never grow grass, and we leave that out. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",107
"108","3009. Is there any common grazing at all within the township ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",108
"109","—No, nothing; not 3 inches of hill pasture. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",109
"110","3010. To whom do you pay for your sea-ware?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",110
"111","—To the ground officer, and the ground officer hands it to the landlord. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",111
"112","3011. Has that always been the practice?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",112
"113","—I never saw it otherwise but one year. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",113
"114","3012. What do you pay for it?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",114
"115","—Is. 6d. a hundred-weight. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",115
"116","3013. How much is that a cart load?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",116
"117","—A cart would not contain a scale. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",117
"118","3014. How much is a scale ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",118
"119","—One hundred-weight. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",119
"120","3015. Do you really mean Is. 6d. per cwt. ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",120
"121","—Yes, the drift ware; we cut the sea-weed for ourselves. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",121
"122","3016. You don't really mean to say you pay Is. 6d. per cwt. for seaware ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",122
"123","—It is not actually weighed, but the ground officer points out the space of the sea-shore on which we are to cut the sea-ware. He is marking out a lot of the seashore on which each has a right to cut. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",123
"124","3017. How many cwts. go to one of the country carts?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",124
"125","—The scale to which I refer is more than a cart-load; sometimes twelve to fifteen cartloads for Is. 6d., and at other times three and four. We measure the sea-ware in creels, and there should be sixty creels in the scale. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",125
"126","3018. How much do you pay in the year for your sea-weed?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",126
"127","—Some of us take 2s. worth and others 2s. 6d. worth, and down to Is. as their families are able to manage. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",127
"128","3019. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",128
"129","—You say you make a large part of your living by fishing ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",129
"130","—Yes.  ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",130
"131","3020. If you had hill pasture, and a larger extent of arable land, would that not rather prevent you pursuing the employment of a fisherman ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",131
"132","—It would; but where there are large families, they will do the spring work in three or four weeks with the cas-chrom. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",132
"133","3021. Do you think there is more to be made at the sea here than is to be made on the land ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",133
"134","—Yes, if there was fishing, but the sea cannot be depended upon. The land is surer. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",134
"135","3022. Do you know if, when the hill pasture was taken away from them, it was done with the view of turning their attention more to fishing ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",135
"136","—I do not know. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",136
"137","3023. You never heard of it ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",137
"138","—I never heard of that. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",138
"139","3024. Sheriff Nicolson.",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",139
"140","—Do they fish for cod and ling here ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",140
"141","—Yes, pretty often. When they don't work at the land, they are working at fishing and at lobsters. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",141
"142","3025. What price do you get for cod and ling?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",142
"143","—Is. for the ling; I am not sure, however. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",143
"144","3026. Is it cured here ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",144
"145","—Some of the fishers do cure, and send to Glasgow themselves. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",145
"146","3027. Have they generally good boats ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",146
"147","—The boats are not bad; they are improving. They are much better than they were in our early recollection. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",147
"148","3028. Did they get new ones for those broken in 1881 ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",148
"149","—Yes. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",149
"150","3029. Professor Mackinnon.",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",150
"151","—You say you have 5 or 6 acres of arable land. Does that include the pasture land?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",151
"152","—That includes all my holding. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",152
"153","3030. And for that you pay £7, 15s. of rent?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",153
"154","—Yes. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",154
"155","3031. And £8, 10s. including taxes?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",155
"156","—Yes. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",156
"157","3032. I think you also said there was no land that could be made arable outside ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",157
"158","—There is arable land outside of my holding; what my forefathers had. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",158
"159","3033. And I suppose there is plenty of pasture land ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",159
"160","—Yes. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",160
"161","3034. Sheriff Nicolson.",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",161
"162","—Does the captain give employment to a good many of the people here ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",162
"163","—He used to give some work. There was not so much work these last two or three years. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",163
"164","3035. Does he go about much among them ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",164
"165","—Yes. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",165
"166","3036. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",166
"167","—Does he live all the year round here?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",167
"168","—Yes, unless he goes south on business. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",168
"169","3037. The Chairman.",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",169
"170","—You stated that about forty-two years ago the hill pasture was taken away from you ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",170
"171","—Yes. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",171
"172","3038. Was it only hill pasture, or was there arable land taken away at the same time ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",172
"173","—The arable land was taken from us at the same time; arable land on which they used to grow potatoes and corn. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",173
"174","3039. You said that this land was now joined to a farm which was in the occupation of the landlord?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",174
"175","—-Yes. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",175
"176","3040. If the proprietor gave them back that land, would it spoil the farm altogether ? Would it take up the whole of the landlord's farm, and spoil it, or would there be enough left to the landlord for a good farm?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",176
"177","—It would take a piece out of the landlord's holding, but he has a good deal more besides that.",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",177
"178","3041. Do you mean a good deal more on the same spot, connected with it ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",178
"179","—Yes, marching with our township. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",179
"180","3042. May that farm in the possession of the landlord be called his home farm—his own particular farm attached to his residence ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",180
"181","—No, it is three or four miles from his dwelling-house, and some of it is six miles from his dwelling-house. He keeps sheep and cattle upon it. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",181
"182","3043. Has the proprietor got another farm nearer his residence in his own hands ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",182
"183","—Yes, plenty; parks and a big farm. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",183
"184","3044. You said that the farming deteriorated when the land was lotted. Do you mean you would prefer a system of cultivation in common—the 'run rig' system ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",184
"185","—Yes, it would be better for us to be as we were before. We might be able to keep a horse, and we might have a herd in common. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",185
"186","3045. Did you ever hear the people express a regret that the old 'run-rig' system had been abolished?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",186
"187","—Yes, they lament it to the present day. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",187
"188","3046. Do you understand what is meant by the ' run rig' system ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",188
"189","— Yes, I understand it; and that is the system which they regret at the present day. They had more land then. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",189
"190","3047. Supposing the common hill pasture were given to them, would that satisfy them, or would they still wish to have a system of 'run-rig' re-established in connection with the arable ground?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",190
"191","—If we got common hill pasture we would be very well satisfied with that. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",191
"192","3048. At the earliest period you can remember, do you think that the clothes and the food and the houses of the people were better or worse than they are now ? Do you think that, in these respects, the people have been improving or not?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",192
"193","—We used to get fine home-made blankets at home, that any person could sleep in, and the clothes my wife would make I could appear in any where, but now lam reduced to purchase south country made cloth, which will not last a year. The food is pretty much as it was. We are getting meal from Glasgow, and we use milk; but our houses are too bare for want of clothing—night clothes especially. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",193
"194","3049. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",194
"195","—If you got this hill land back, would you be willing to pay a fair rent for it 1",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",195
"196","—Yes. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",196
"197","3050. Now, the present laird is evidently a very good landlord, who lives among you, and has not raised your rent. That being the case, if you get back the hill land, would you really set to work and improve the arable land, which under present circumstances, you have not done, without assistance ? Would you take in the whole of what is now uncultivated of your arable land ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",197
"198","—Yes, if we would have such encouragement. We are considering our present land dear at its present rent. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",198
"199","3051. But I understand you would feel so encouraged by being able to send your cows to the hill, that you would really then set to work to ameliorate the croft so far as it might be possible for you to do it ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",199
"200","—Yes, we would do our best, if we would not be removed out of it. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",200
"201","3052. But you are not at all afraid of eviction ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",201
"202","—The landlord was not given to eviction unless a person would do wrong, but we have not such a good bargain. We are not the least afraid of eviction as long as we behave ourselves. ",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",202
"203","3053. Can you say the same all over this estate of Waternish—that the people feel the same ?",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",203
"204","—I do not say. I speak for the part of the property on which I am myself.",50,"Donald Mckinnon","Skye, Waternish",204
