"1","JOHN ROBERTSON, Merchant, Portree (42)—examined.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",1
"2","8992. Sheriff Nicolson.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",2
"3","—What is the nature of your business or trade1?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",3
"4","—Draper and grocer.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",4
"5","8993. You do a great deal of business besides that ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",5
"6","—Yes, in fishcuring.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",6
"7","8994. I believe you were elected to say something here on the part of some people ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",7
"8","—Yes, in my absence I was.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",8
"9","8995. Then you will be so good as to state what the views or facts are that you were asked to represent to the Commission ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",9
"10","—I believe that the poverty of the people has been caused principally by their small holdings, by their being huddled together along the shore of what is considered the worst part of the land, I believe that is the great cause of the poverty of the crofters, along with bad seasons and the failure of the fishing. I honestly believe the principal cause is the smallness of their holdings.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",10
"11","8996. Is that the cause, so far as your knowledge goes, in the parish of Portree, and in Skye generally?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",11
"12","—Yes. I have not been much in the west of Skye, but I do business with people there, and I have been listening to their complaints from time to time.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",12
"13","8997. Have you heard these complaints made for a long time back?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",13
"14","—Yes, as far back as I remember.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",14
"15","8998. Do you attribute the representations that have been made to us by delegates chosen by the people in any way to the influence of persons from the outside, who have come putting notions into their heads?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",15
"16","—No, I do not",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",16
"17","8999. Have you been reading the newspapers, and seeing the statements of the crofters in all the places we have visited ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",17
"18","—Yes, and I may say they have put me in mind of the Gaelic saying—but the evidence since then has perhaps toned down the idea a good deal—A bhèist a's mò ag itheadh na beist a's lugha, 's abhèist a's lugha adeanamh mar a dh'fhaodasi,'—which means, 'The larger beast eating the smaller beast, and the small beast doing what it can.'",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",18
"19","9000. Do they practise fishing much about here?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",19
"20","—Yes, when there are fish to be caught. ",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",20
"21","9001. Chiefly the herring fishing from Portree?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",21
"22","—Yes. ",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",22
"23","9002. The people of the Braes and all the townships along from Camustionavaig are engaged in the fishing?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",23
"24","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",24
"25","9003. And the people round about the bay of Portree?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",25
"26","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",26
"27","9004. Are there a considerable number of them engaged in the salmon fishing?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",27
"28","—Not many; some are, of course.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",28
"29","9005. But that only lasts for a short time?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",29
"30","—For a short season.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",30
"31","9006. Do they all go to the east coast fishing?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",31
"32","—The majority of them go to the east coast",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",32
"33","9007. How do you find them in your dealings with them?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",33
"34","—I find them very honest when they have the means to pay; but I find they are not able to pay regularly.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",34
"35","9008. I suppose they are owing you a good deal of money?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",35
"36","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",36
"37","9009. Is there a tendency to increase the debt from year to year?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",37
"38","—Yes; especially when there is not a good herring fishing, I find there is great difficulty in getting my money from them.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",38
"39","9010. Last year was particularly bad?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",39
"40","—Last year and the year before that. Last year was worse than the year before, and the year before that was still worse; but the year 1880 was a good year for fishing. I cured that year 1550 barrels, and last year only 850.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",40
"41","9011. Barrels of herring caught round the coast here?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",41
"42","—Yes; there were a good few caught in Loch Hourn.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",42
"43","9012. A great many of the men go there to fish when there is fishing?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",43
"44","—Yes; their boats, however, are too small for going that distance. As a rule, the boats are only suitable for the Sound of Skye.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",44
"45","9013. Professor Mackinnon.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",45
"46","—You say you have heard complaints ever since you remember, and you have read the evidence given by the people themselves?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",46
"47","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",47
"48","9014. Is that evidence practically the outcome of what you have been hearing since you remember?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",48
"49","—I think so; there may be a little colouring in part of it.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",49
"50","9015. Perhaps a little stronger, but just giving definite shape to what you have been hearing all along?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",50
"51","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",51
"52","9016. And have you been here all your life?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",52
"53","—Yes, with the exception of five years.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",53
"54","9017. How long is it since you became engaged in business?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",54
"55","—I have been twenty years in business.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",55
"56","9018. Have you observed generally any change in the habits of the people with respect to food and clothing during that time?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",56
"57","—Not much; they are a little better.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",57
"58","9019. Not much within twenty years?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",58
"59","—No.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",59
"60","9020. But gradually improving in that respect?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",60
"61","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",61
"62","9021. And their food in the same way?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",62
"63","—I cannot say so much for their food. I always thought their food was as substantial before as now.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",63
"64","9022. Do they buy increasing quantities of luxuries?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",64
"65","—Well, I don't see what they can buy except tea; milk is scarcer than it was.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",65
"66","9023. And getting scarcer?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",66
"67","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",67
"68","9024. So even if their natural inclination was against it, they are obliged to take tea as a substitute?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",68
"69","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",69
"70","9025. Then, this year apart, which was an exceptionally bad year, are you able to concur with those who say that of late years the condition of the people has been getting worse ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",70
"71","—-I do not know it is much worse, except on account of the severe gales of the last two yeare. As regards the fishing, thirty years ago this used to be a famous place for fishing. I remember when a boy, as many as 800 boats going out of the bay of Portree. The last good fishing was in 1857—the year I went to serve my time —and ever since 1857 it has been going gradually back, till within the last five or six years, when it has made a start again.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",71
"72","9026. That is the herring fishing ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",72
"73","—Yes, and since then I think the people have been rather improving, for they have got better nets and",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",73
"74","boats than they had formerly. From the year 1857 till six or seven years ago, there were scarcely any nets worth speaking of, but since then they have got better nets.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",74
"75","9027. Do you think the fishing is capable of further development if they had better boats and nets?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",75
"76","—If they had larger boats they could follow the herring fishing still farther off the island.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",76
"77","9028. What about the local fishing?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",77
"78","—They are quite prepared for the local fishing.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",78
"79","9029. Is it going back or improving?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",79
"80","—Last year was not so good as the previous year.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",80
"81","9030. Do you think it is capable of improvement —that they could do more than they do?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",81
"82","—No, I do not think they could. Whenever they find that there are herring on the coast, they are at them. They are not lazy; of that I can assure you.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",82
"83","9031. Do you know about the cod and ling fishing?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",83
"84","—We have nothing of that now.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",84
"85","9032. Lobsters?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",85
"86","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",86
"87","9033. You fish these in winter?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",87
"88","—Yes, from September to the end of March.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",88
"89","9034. Do many of them engage in that during winter?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",89
"90","—Well, the lobsters are not to be got every year. Round by Uig, Kilmaluag, Rona, Glendale, and Waternish, these are the places. There are no lobsters at the south end of the island or in the Sound here.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",90
"91","9035. Supposing the mass of the people were to obtain larger crofts, what would become of the fishing?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",91
"92","—They would be able to devote a certain portion of their time still to the fishing.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",92
"93","9036. Would you think it advisable that a crofter should be a crofter, and a fisherman a fisherman?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",93
"94","—Scarcely, I am afraid the fishing here is necessary. I would give a man a little land, even if he were a fisherman.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",94
"95","9037. Yes; but don't you think a good croft might suffer when the man was devoting himself to fishing?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",95
"96","—It depends on the number of the family. There might be three or four brothers, and two could manage the farm and two the fishing. I do not think it could interfere so much with the farm.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",96
"97","9038. Their feelings are evidently set upon a larger amount of land. Have you found them expressing a reluctance with regard to emigration in any shape or form?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",97
"98","—I do not think they are fond of emigration. I have often asked them about it, and they say that emigration has been tried and does not better those left behind a bit.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",98
"99","9039. Emigration as conducted hitherto in Skye has not benefited those who remained, but could it not be conducted so that it might?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",99
"100","—Yes, certainty it could, if the land that belonged to those that went away were given to those who remained behind.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",100
"101","9040. Do you think in that view some might be induced to go?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",101
"102","—Not so long as there are so many large farms in Skye; I do not think they would like to leave their native land.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",102
"103","9041. They would like te people Skye first, and then send the surplus to the colonies?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",103
"104","—I think so.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",104
"105","9042. From your knowledge of these matters, is it your opinion that there are a considerable number of them, who upon reasonable terms would be able to undertake a moderately sized croft?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",105
"106","—Yes, I daresay a good many of them are able; but I believe they would have been abler some years ago than they are now. ",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",106
"107","9043. But still you think there are some?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",107
"108","—Yes, I think there are some amongst them who could stock it.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",108
"109","9044. But many are not?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",109
"110","—Yes, a great many would require to be assisted. If they got a guarantee that they would not be removed out of these lands so long as they paid their rent, I have no doubt that some people would come to their assistance, and help them to stock their crofts.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",110
"111","9045. A guarantee against removal is not so much a practical necessity as is a guarantee against raising of rent?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",111
"112","—I mean both; that the arrangement might remain for a certain number of years.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",112
"113","9046. Because, as a matter of fact, within the limited area they have got, there have been very few removals?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",113
"114","—No, there have not been so many removals, as raising of rent.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",114
"115","9047. With respect to subdivision of the crofts, I suppose you would set your face strongly against that?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",115
"116","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",116
"117","9048. It has gone on too far?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",117
"118","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",118
"119","9049. And no doubt that is in great measure owing to the desire of the people themselves to keep their own family about them?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",119
"120","—Yes. And because they could not get crofts.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",120
"121","9050. And due also in some measure to those removed from cleared townships being thrown in upon them?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",121
"122","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",122
"123","9051. That is within your own recollection?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",123
"124","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",124
"125","9052. Within your own recollection the area of the crofting population has diminished?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",125
"126","—-It has.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",126
"127","9053. By taking the hill pasture from them, in some cases to add to large farms, and in other cases by clearing the townships altogether? Have you seen both?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",127
"128","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",128
"129","9054. Have you seen the reverse process?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",129
"130","—No.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",130
"131","9055. You have not seen a new township opened?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",131
"132","—No.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",132
"133","9056. Or additional land given to old townships?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",133
"134","—No.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",134
"135","9057. We have been told that that has been done at Ulinish?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",135
"136","—It must have been lately.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",136
"137","9058. Mr Cameron.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",137
"138","—I understood you to say that if people who were industrious and showed perseverance, took larger holdings, they would find people who would advance money to stock these?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",138
"139","—Yes, that is my opinion.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",139
"140","9059. May I ask who these people are?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",140
"141","—There are benevolent strangers in the country, that have been advancing money to a large extent already.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",141
"142","9060. Do you think the flow of mouey from these benevolent strangers would continue?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",142
"143","—Well, along with the proprietors, they might continue to help the people.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",143
"144","9061. Do you think the proprietors would have it in their power to advance funds to stock any considerable part of the land in Skye?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",144
"145","—Not to any very considerable extent; I would not wish the large farms to be all broken down.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",145
"146","9062. But in order to make a considerable difference in the number of holders of land in Skye, which many people desire or wish to see, would it not require a great deal of capital to be advanced? Do you think the proprietors and benevolent strangers would be sufficient to raise the capital?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",146
"147","—I don't think the capital required would be very great, along with what they have, to stock a £ 10 or £20 croft.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",147
"148","9063. Would not that depend very much on the number of crofters that would require to be assisted?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",148
"149","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",149
"150","9064. And if you wanted to help the crofters to stock as much land as one man now has, the same amount of capital would then be required ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",150
"151","—Yes, but they are not absolutely free of stock. They have less or more cattle on the ground; and if these were allowed to multiply, the landlord need not be exacting the rent.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",151
"152","9065. But what would happen during the time the stock was multiplying?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",152
"153","—I would have the landlord do what I often do,—take something to account. In the case of a fisherman or crofter, when he cannot pay his bill for meal, amounting perhaps to £10, to £12, or even £20, I have taken as little as £ 4 or £ 5 to account, and let him go on.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",153
"154","9066. But would not a crofter make rather a bad start with that debt hanging round his neck 1",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",154
"155","—He might; but he would by-and-bye get out of it.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",155
"156","9067. What is the price of the meal that you supply?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",156
"157","—20s. a boll.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",157
"158","9068. Have you read any of the evidence given in other places ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",158
"159","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",159
"160","9069. There was a dealer in Bracadale who stated to us that he has selling meal at 23s. a boll. Do you consider that dear?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",160
"161","—It depends on where he took it from.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",161
"162","9070. Is it the best quality that you sell for 20s.?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",162
"163","—I just write for meal; I do not keep a store of meal.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",163
"164","9071. Do you make a small profit upon it ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",164
"165","—Very little.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",165
"166","9072. You can afford to sell at 20s. ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",166
"167","—With a very small profit",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",167
"168","9073. Would you consider 23s. to be rather dear?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",168
"169","—It depends entirely on what he paid for it.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",169
"170","9074. Do you deal in groceries, such as sugar and tea ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",170
"171","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",171
"172","9075. What do you sell tea at ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",172
"173","—I have two classes—at 2s. 6d. and 3s.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",173
"174","9076. Sugar ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",174
"175","—Fourpence per lb., and moist sugar at threepence.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",175
"176","9077. Do you consider fivepence a high price for sugar?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",176
"177","—Yes, I consider it high, but it depends on where it is sold and what it takes to carry it to the place.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",177
"178","9078. What class of work are the people here most fond of when they go south? What do they take to most readily ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",178
"179","—Railroad making.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",179
"180","9079. I believe Skyemen are famous for being good roadmen?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",180
"181","—Yes, they are good at almost anything except improving their crofts.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",181
"182","9080. Were many Skyemen employed in the construction of the Callander and Oban Railway ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",182
"183","—I think there were some.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",183
"184","9081. Have you heard of the scheme that is now proposed for making a railway by the west coast to Inverness ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",184
"185","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",185
"186","9082. If that went on do you think it would be useful in the way of finding work for the people who go south ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",186
"187","—I think it would.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",187
"188","9083. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",188
"189","—What is the population of the town of Portree ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",189
"190","— Between 700 and 800.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",190
"191","9084. Are you well acquainted with the feelings of the people generally in all public matters °",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",191
"192","—Yes, pretty well.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",192
"193","9085. Is there a great deal of sympathy in Portree for the crofters ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",193
"194","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",194
"195","9086. Is the feeling very general in the town ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",195
"196","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",196
"197","9087. You have said that industrious and sober crofters might get some assistance from outsiders, if they had larger lands given to them ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",197
"198","—Yes, with a guarantea that the rents would not be increased, and that they would not be removed so long as they paid their rent.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",198
"199","9088. You told us several of them are in debt in your books . Would you not prefer as an outsider to advance money to a crofter to go into his new holding under these conditions, rather than to give him credit as you are doing just now?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",199
"200","—Yes, I would. I have already helped them to pay their rents, without charging them any interest, by signing bills for them,",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",200
"201","9089. Is there anything in the character or disposition of the population of Skye that would prevent them from bettering themselves and their own condition, except the insecurity under which they labour, from constant evictions and fear of dispossession ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",201
"202","—That is all.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",202
"203","9090. Are you aware it is a very natural thing for a man whose father and grandfather were in better circumstances than himself, to think with pride, of the time when his forefathers were in a better position ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",203
"204","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",204
"205","9091. They cling to that ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",205
"206","—Yes, many of them do.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",206

"208","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",208
"209","9093. That is a strong feeling with them ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",209

"213","9095. Supposing you wanted to take a croft at £10, with (say) five cows, two horses, and about fifty sheep, can you give me any idea of what money you would require to put into it ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",213
"214","—I would require about £150.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",214
"215","9096. And in the case of a crofter who has already a good deal of that stock, the additional stock required would be comparatively little?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",215
"216","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",216
"217","9097. Perhaps £50 for each crofter would be enough in addition to his present holding ?",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",217
"218","—Yes.",161,"John Robertson","Skye, Portree",218
