"1","RODERICK MACKENZIE, Crofter, Nether Coll (75)—examined.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",1
"2","16022. The Chairman.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",2
"3","—This is the statement you have submitted to the Commission:",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",3
"4","Statements by Roderick M'Kenzie, crofter, and Malcolm M'Leod, crofter and mason, both of the township of Coll, to be submitted to the Commission on behalf of the crofters of said town. Fifty years ago the township of Coll was inhabited by twenty-two crofters, keeping from three to five milk cows, with several young beasts all in good condition, and from twelve to forty sheep. Before Sir James Matheson bought the estate four crofters were put in upon our township, and when the township of Garryghuirm was cleared other four were put in upon Coll, bringing the number of crofters in Coll up to thirty (see Appendix A. XL). At the same time a portion of the arable land belonging to the township was taken from the people, and given to the tacksmen for whom the people were put out of Garryghuirm, thus reducing the arable land of the people, while the inhabitants of the township are considerably increased. About thirty-three years ago the place was relotted out and made into forty-seven crofts, the rent of which was £120; since then twenty crofters have been put in upon the township, every one of them paying rent over and above the £120, at which the township was rented when it was relotted. So that we now stand thus— ",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",4
"5","1st, the township is made less by taking some of our arable land and adding it to the neighbouring tack; ",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",5
"6","2nd, putting people in upon us in addition to the natural growth of the population, until now we have three families to the one we originally had; ",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",6
"7","3rd, the rent being increased gives the privilege of increasing the stock, until people and cattle are starved alike, increasing taxes and every other source of poverty and misery.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",7
"8","The boundary dyke between us and one tacksman was built by contract, for which every head of family in Coll had to pay 10s. Still we have to keep it up as often as any part of it falls down; yet if any of our sheep or cattle go over it, they are pounded and paid for before we get them out. We are so much pressed by tacksmen on both sides, and behind by sportsmen and their gamekeepers, that we are not allowed to walk without the fear of being taken up as trespassers, even upon the hill pasture for which we pay rent. There are twenty-eight crofters in the township of Coll, having only one starved cow each, when the tack on the one hand of us would keep one hundred families in comfort, and the one on the other side eighty. Further, we beg to state to the Commission that in one case we know of an old man who fell into arrears of rent, and could not pay, a young man who was willing to take land would not get the old man's lot until he got security that he would pay the old man's debt, for which he paid £13, which he only managed by selling the two cows he had. In Coll just now there are ten married men and twenty-six single men, who would take land to-morrow if they got the chance. Suggested remedies for the foregoing grievances—",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",8
"9","1st Increased holdings, with sufficient moorland and hill pasture to enable us to rear stock to pay our rent. ",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",9
"10","2nd Revaluation of land by competent parties who know the locality, and security of tenure so long as the rent is paid. ",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",10
"11","3rd, Compensation for unexhausted improvements.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",11
"12","4th, That tenants have a full and free access to all moorlands and hill pasture connected with their township, and have a right to pluck heather and cut rushes for thatching houses or any purpose of that nature without the fear of gamekeeper or ground officer.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",12
"13","16023. Sheriff Nicolson.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",13
"14","—Do you remember when the first addition was made to the number of crofters at Coll ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",14
"15","—Yes.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",15
"16","16024. Fifty years ago there were twenty-two. When was the first addition ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",16
"17","—As I first remember fifty years ago there were two lots in the town.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",17
"18","16025. But when was the first increase in the number of lots?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",18
"19","—Fortythree years ago.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",19
"20","16026. How many were added to their number then?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",20
"21","—Ten families were put in upon us about forty-three years ago from the outside.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",21
"22","16027. Where were these taken from?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",22
"23","—From Garryghuirm, which was cleared, and another township. Out of that place four families were sent in upon us, and these have now become six families.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",23
"24","16028. What direction is Garyghuirin from Coll ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",24
"25","—South.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",25
"26","16029. What was done with the land from which these people were brought?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",26
"27","—It is under sheep occupied by the tacksman who marches with us.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",27
"28","16030. What is the name of the tack ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",28
"29","—Upper Coll.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",29
"30","16031. How much arable land was taken from them and added to that tack ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",30
"31","—Perhaps about £8 worth, and there was no abatement made in the rent. ",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",31
"32","16032. The place was re-lotted about thirty-three years ago and made into forty-seven crofts. Who was factor at that time ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",32
"33","—Mr Scobie was factor at that time. He only occupied that office for three years.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",33
"34","16033. The rent then was £120. How much was the rent fifty years ago ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",34
"35","—It appears that it is Mr Munro Mackenzie that lotted the town. He succeeded Mr Scobie, and it was he who fixed the rental at £120.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",35
"36","16034. What was it before that?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",36
"37","—The previous rental was the same.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",37
"38","16035. What was the rent fifty years ago?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",38
"39","—I cannot remember. I think it was the same amount.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",39
"40","16036. When the place was re-lotted and made into forty-seven crofts, where did the people belong to, to whom these new crofts were given ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",40
"41","—They belonged to the place.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",41
"42","16037. None were brought from any other place, were they?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",42
"43","—Not since Sir James came.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",43
"44","16038. The rent being increased gives the privilege of increasing the stock. What is the meaning of that? Does it mean that everybody may keep as much stock as he likes ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",44
"45","—They cannot keep more stock.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",45
"46","16039. What stock do you keep yourself?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",46
"47","—Two cows and a year-old.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",47
"48","16040. No more?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",48
"49","—Four head of sheep; no horse.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",49
"50","16041. Have any of the crofters more cows than that?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",50
"51","—There are four that have larger stock than I had; but there are twenty-eight in the place who have only one cow, and a stirk perhaps as well.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",51
"52","16042. What rent do you pay ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",52
"53","—£2, 9s. That rent was only £2, 7s. when the rents were settled by the factor upon information supplied by myself. There was an odd 6d. that has to be added to certain of the crofts—in order to make the proper subdivision of the £120, which was the rent of the whole township. But the factor said there would be",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",53
"54","no 6d., that it would require to be a full shilling—and this shilhng, along with the shilling for hen money, has made the rent £2, 9s.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",54
"55","16043. How long have you been living in Coll?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",55
"56","—Fifty-three years.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",56
"57","16044. What rent were you paying first ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",57
"58","—The same rent.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",58
"59","16045. Had you more cows then than you have now ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",59
"60","—Yes.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",60
"61","16046. How many had you?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",61
"62","—Five head of cattle.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",62
"63","16047. And more sheep?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",63
"64","—We had no sheep to speak of. There is no sheep pasture.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",64
"65","16048. Did you grow more corn and potatoes then than you do now ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",65
"66","—Yes, at that time, but not since our lots were reduced.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",66
"67","16049. How long do your own corn and potatoes keep your families alive in an ordinary year ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",67
"68","—According to the seasons. But eight bolls of barley-meal was the largest amount that ever I made in one single year, sometimes four or five, sometimes six, and about one and a half bolls of oatmeal.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",68
"69","16050. How long would that last you ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",69
"70","—Our own crofts used to tide us over the winter and sometimes longer.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",70
"71","16051. How long would the potatoes last in a single year?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",71
"72","—In a very good year we might have fifty barrels of potatoes, and these would last till spring. Many years we might not have twenty barrels.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",72
"73","16052. How many bolls of corn of your own had you last year, and how many barrels of potatoes?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",73
"74","—I had no potatoes at all. I could scarcely say that the potatoes grew at all last season, but I managed to save two bolls of barley from the storm, and that was all my crop.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",74
"75","16053. Then, in former times, did you require to buy meal after spring to keep your families ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",75
"76","—You know that since Sir James Matheson got the property and since the potato disease, things have been very hard. I would have to buy some years fourteen, twelve, or ten bolls of meal, to support my own family, in addition to the crop.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",76
"77","16054. How much have you had to buy since last autumn?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",77
"78","—I have bought already thirteen bolls of meal.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",78
"79","16055. How many more will you need before next autumn?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",79
"80","—I cannot tell. It must be a great deal, if it can only be had. ",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",80
"81","16056. What else have you to live upon besides meal?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",81
"82","—Sugar. We have neither butter nor flesh. We neither kill cow nor sheep.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",82
"83","16057. Is that the general condition of the people at Coll?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",83
"84","—The greater portion of them. How can they be otherwise when their single cow does not give milk? They cannot make 2 lbs. of butter in the year.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",84
"85","16058. Have they any work at home in the island of Lewis?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",85
"86","—No, there is nothing of that kind now; but as long as Sir James, worthy man, lived, there was work going that kept some people employed.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",86
"87","16059. How far are you from the sea at Coll?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",87
"88","—No distance at all.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",88
"89","16060. Are many of your people engaged in fishing?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",89
"90","—Yes, the young people.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",90
"91","16061. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",91
"92","—You say in this paper that this township is hemmed in by tacks and tacksmen. Will you mention the names ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",92
"93","—Upper Coll. ",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",93
"94","16062. What is the name of the tenant ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",94
"95","—Mr Hunter. Roderick",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",95
"96","16063. Which is the other?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",96
"97","—It is another township occupied by crofters that marches with us on the other side.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",97
"98","16064. But you say 'we are so much pressed by tacksmen on both sides.' Is that correct ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",98
"99","—The other side is occupied by a crofting township like ourselves. We differ sometimes.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",99
"100","16065. What is the meaning of this stated in the paper that they are not allowed to work without the fear of being taken up as trespassers upon their own hill pasture ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",100
"101","—The gamekeepers think that at certain seasons of the year they will not allow a man or beast to go upon the moorland pasture, and they employ one out upon this moorland pasture during the summer. They keep a man out upon the moorland pasture to take up any man or child whom they may find straying there, in case he may be there robbing the nests of the birds.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",101
"102","16066. Is this a deer forest or an ordinary grouse shooting?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",102
"103","—We have no deer now. I remember the day—I was young at the time—when I could see one hundred deers on the hill, and I could not see three now.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",103
"104","16067. What is the name of the gamekeeper who does what you have mentioned ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",104
"105","—I don't remember his name exactly. He belongs to Gress.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",105
"106","16068. What is the name of the shooting tenant?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",106
"107","—I don't know. He is an English gentleman living in London.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",107
"108","16069. Why do you and the other people pay attention to such conduct on the part of the gamekeeper ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",108
"109","—Bless you ! have not I seen two lads sent for nine weeks to the prison there for robbing a grouse nest, and one of them barely came out alive ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",109
"110","16070. But it is one thing to steal eggs and another thing to walk over your own grounds upon your own lawful business?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",110
"111","—That is quite the case, but our great complaint is that we are prevented from sending a boy or anybody else out to attend to the cattle.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",111
"112","16071. Are you afraid of being turned off if you stand out against any such conduct ? Are you afraid of being disturbed in your holdings ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",112
"113","—Yes, we are.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",113
"114","16072. Is the gamekeeper in the stated regular employment of the proprietor, or is he one that is changeable with the tenant ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",114
"115","—I am not very sure, but he may be in the service of both. I believe he is in the service of the man who is the shooting tenant.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",115
"116","16073. Do you consider him, in point of fact, an authority upon the estate, whose will is not to be gone against ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",116
"117","—Yes, we look upon him in that light. It is the part of the tenants to be obedient.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",117
"118","16074. You say here that there are twenty-six single men in your township who would likely take land to-morrow if they got the chance. What exactly are they looking for? Is it at present uncultivated land that they would take in and cultivate, or what ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",118
"119","—The waste townships that are under sheep, that were cleared before, these are the places the people are looking for, and would be glad to get.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",119
"120","16075. But is there any place of that nature near you except Upper Coll ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",120
"121","—No, except Garryghuirm, that was formerly cleared.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",121
"122","16076. To whom does Garryghuirm belong?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",122
"123","—To Mr Hunter.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",123
"124","16077. How many families do you suppose this tack, if broken up and made into large sized crofts, would keep ? You say, on the one hand, it would keep a hundred families in comfort and on the other eighty. Now, which do you mean would keep a hundred families, and which would  keep eighty ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",124
"125","—Colurich [Upper Coll, transcriber's note] and Garryghuirm could accommodate a hundred families and Gress could accommodate eighty. ",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",125
"126","—Are all these places in the neighbourhood ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",126
"127","—Yes.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",127
"128","16078. Is the township much in arrear of rent do you know?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",128
"129","—I believe they are in arrears this year.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",129
"130","16079. Would the people, if they got the additional land be enabled to stock it ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",130
"131","—They would stock it by degrees.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",131
"132","16080. Supposing they got assistance to stock it at the beginning, would they be willing to pay back by instalment ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",132
"133","—Yes, that they would.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",133
"134","16081. From what you know of the sentiments of the townships do you say they want no relief whatever in the way of alms but whatever they wish for they will pay in time ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",134
"135","—Any assistance they might get they would pay it back; they don't look for alms.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",135
"136","16082. Mr Cameron.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",136
"137","—You said there was an old man who was in arrears of rent and that his successor stepped into the croft, paid the arrears by selling the cows, and the arrears were £13 ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",137
"138","—Yes, that is quite correct.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",138
"139","16083. If the old tenant owed £13 to the landlord, the landlord might himself have sold the cows, and it would have come to the same thing ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",139
"140","—If it would be as well to do so, still the man had to have his cattle sold in order to pay these arrears.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",140
"141","16084. Did the cattle belong to the new man, or did they belong to the landlord—as due for arrears of rent?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",141
"142","—They belonged to the incoming tenant.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",142
"143","16085. Had the outgoing tenant any stock at all?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",143
"144","—The state of affairs was this, that the old man had only one son, and he died. He and his wife were getting frail, and they had an elderly daughter who was supporting them. Now this daughter was getting parochial relief for attending upon her father and mother, and she thought that the rent of the croft should be paid as well as the relief she got for these services she rendered. Now, when the young man got the croft there was only £4 or £5 of debt, and when the debt had increased to £13, Mr Munro, the then chamberlain, came and insisted with violent language that the whole of this debt must be paid, and the new tenant sold his own two cows and paid the debt.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",144
"145","16086. Was he a relation?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",145
"146","—No, no relation whatever.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",146
"147","16087. Or his wife ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",147
"148","—His wife was not a relation either.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",148
"149","16088. Is it a practice in the townships, or on that part of the estate with which you are acquainted, for the new tenant to pay the arrears of the old ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",149
"150","—I have heard several instances in addition to this one, from whom Mr Munro, the chamberlain, exacted the arrears of rent in this way.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",150
"151","16089. And does the practice still prevail at all?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",151
"152","—I don't know what the practice may be just now. Ever since the present factor came in there was nothing of that sort done upon us. These things were done by",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",152
"153","his two predecessors.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",153
"154","16090. The Chairman.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",154
"155","—Was this young man in possession for some time before the £13 was demanded of him?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",155
"156","—He would be about ten years in possession.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",156
"157","16091. Did he pay his own rent regularly from the beginning?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",157
"158","—Yes.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",158
"159","16092. And had he cropped the land when it was in possession of the old people and the daughter ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",159
"160","—No.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",160
"161","16093. Are the tenants bound by the estate rules to keep a herd for their cattle ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",161
"162","—We have a herd for the sheep. And the estate authorities wished there should also be one herd or two herds for the cattle, so that there should be no trespassing upon the moorland pasture, for the sake of the grouse, but the people of the place objected to such an arrangement.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",162
"163","16094. Then it is a rule of the estate that only the herds or shepherds shall be upon the moor at a particular time of the year ?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",163
"164","—Yes, that is the rule of the estate. ",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",164
"165","16095. I forgot to ask the name of the crofter who paid this sum of money for the arrears of his predecessor?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",165
"166","—Donald M'lver, Nether Coll.",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",166
"167","16096. And the name of his predecessor?",292,"Roderick Mackenzie","Lewis, Stornoway",167
