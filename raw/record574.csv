"6","The principal cause of our grievances is the repeated rising of our rent from 1850 to 1876. When Beinntirchladain, with other portions composing half of our hill pasture, were taken away twenty-five years ago by the factor as the share of eight crofts, and added to his own farm, our rent was considerably raised. Subsequently two of the eight crofts were relet; and a row having been raised by the new occupiers for hill pasturage for their crofts, which was provided to them by taking away reclaimed portions of other crofts. Our stock was not reduced in proportion to our pasturage, on which twenty-four crofters had a right to keep three sheep each and their horses in summer, and besides fifteen crofters having the privilege of sending their cattle to it all the year round. First, crofters built and maintained dwellings, steadings, and fences by clearing much of their croft lands from groundfast stones, which have been improved upon by their successors in many cases, and we suppose by the proprietor in some cases. Now our rent is raised the last thirty-three years from about £ 4 to more than the double bare rent, without any regard to the quality or condition of our croftlands or capacity of our pasturage, no compensation given for improvements on being evicted, or on quitting, and no inducement for improvements. In 1872 we petitioned to restore us our old boundaries, the farm to which the same has been added being then in his Grace's own hands for two years. Our petition to his Grace for three years was rejected in 1881, though based on the excess of stock assigned to our occupation and excess of rent laid on us, and humbly praying that his Grace would be graciously pleased to appoint valuators or assessors to compute stock and adjust rent. However, for that year some help was given to some for losses by storm or otherwise. Constant tillage to raise provender, generally scarce, deteriorates the production of our crofts. On the area of a mile of the poorest land in Ross, there are forty-six families who are paying rent directly or indirectly, with the exception of five paupers. Of late there is a progressive mode of diminishing our pasturage by giving sites and adding lands for another rent to our great annoyance.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",6

"25","—It does.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",25
"26","34383. But in the meantime a portion of the hill pasture was taken away? Was the amount of stock reduced by the hill pasture being taken away ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",26
"27","—We were keeping the same stock, but we had not sufficient food for them as before.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",27

"41","—They got houses that had been erected before.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",41

"43","—I cannot tell.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",43
"44","34392. What became of the old tenants who lived in the houses before ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",44
"45","—They had perhaps died, the houses were vacant at any rate.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",45
"46","34393. In the year 1872 we petitioned 'to restore to us the old boundaries ; does that mean that in 1872 you petitioned to have those portions of the township restored to you which had been taken by the factor ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",46
"47","—Yes.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",47

"57","—It would be large enough.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",57
"58","34399. Why did the farm remain in the Duke's hands?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",58
"59","—The person who occupied it died.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",59
"60","34400. It was over two years in his Grace's hands; did his Grace execute improvements upon it ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",60
"61","—I am not aware.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",61
"62","34401. Was it retained by his Grace in consequence of a difficulty in finding a tenant ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",62
"63","—I cannot say. ",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",63
"64","34402. What is the present area of the arable land of each croft ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",64
"65","—I cannot tell the acreage, but I can tell the quantity of seed that was put into it.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",65
"66","34403. Can you not tell about how much in acres?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",66
"67","—It maybe guessed to be between three and four acres in each croft, but that is a mere guess.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",67
"68","34404. Then it stands at three cows, one stirk, three sheep, one horse for £8, 14s. ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",68
"69","—We have no sheep at all now since that hill was taken from us.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",69
"70","34405. You say that on an area of a mile of the poorest land in Ross there are forty-six families; does that mean in your own place ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",70
"71","—Yes.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",71
"72","34406. You say that the pasturage is being diminished by giving sites; to whom are those sites given",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",72

"74","—To people who have no land.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",74
"75","34407. What amount is given in that case to each family ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",75

"81","34410. Is the place near the sea?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",81
"82","—No; part of it is very far from the sea.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",82
"83","34411. Are these people to whom sites are given fishermen?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",83
"84","—They do fish, but that is not their ordinary occupation.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",84
"85","34412. Professor Mackinnon.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",85

"89","—No, in Tormore.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",89
"90","34414. Who was the factor at the time those crofts were taken from you ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",90
"91","—John Campbell.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",91

"97","—Yes.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",97
"98","34418. The farm of Ardfenaig was at that time over two years vacant?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",98
"99","—Yes.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",99
"100","34419. And it is now occupied by a tacksman who lives there?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",100
"101","—Yes.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",101
"102","34420. How much stock would that pasture which was taken from you keep?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",102
"103","—We were keeping three sheep each on the twenty-four crofts on that hill, and the horses during summer and autumn.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",103
"104","34421. So that you have ceased to keep the sheep since you lost the pasture ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",104
"105","—Yes; we have no place to keep them.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",105
"106","34422. But you are keeping the horses still?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",106
"107","—Yes.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",107
"108","34423. But you say your pasture is by that amount so much the worse ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",108
"109","—Yes, in so much that, although we are keeping the same number of cows, our land does not produce grass sufficient to feed them during summer.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",109
"110","34424. Is it the arable land or the pasture land of your place that is being injured by these new houses that are being put up?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",110
"111","—It is the pasture that is injured.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",111
"112","34425. There are none of the houses being put upon the arable portion of the crofts?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",112
"113","—No.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",113
"114","34426. Your rent was raised, you say, in 1850?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",114
"115","—Well, it was raised just about that time—from 1850 to 1876.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",115
"116","34427. 1850 was in Mr Campbell's time also ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",116
"117","—Yes.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",117
"118","34428. What was the reason alleged for the rent being raised in that terrible year?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",118
"119","—That is a thing I cannot tell; but when the ground was taken from us the rent was immediately raised.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",119
"120","34429. That was in one of the worst years following the potato disease ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",120
"121","—Yes.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",121
"122","34430. The rents then remained the same till 1876 ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",122
"123","—There was very little increase until 1876.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",123
"124","34431. Who was the factor in 1876 when the rent was raised?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",124
"125","—The present chamberlain.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",125
"126","34432. And it was raised in that year from £5, 4s. 9d. to £ 8 , 14s. Was there any reason given to you at the time for that large increase ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",126
"127","—No reason whatever was given to us.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",127
"128","34433. But you consider the rent too high ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",128
"129","—Undoubtedly. We, three years in succession, sent a request to the proprietor to reduce the rent in respect of its being too high, but we got no reply for the first two years. The third year we got replies stating that the rents would not be reduced, but that the Duke would agree to give some assistance to the tenants on account of some special losses they had sustained; and he did give that to those who needed it.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",129
"130","34434. What were the special losses?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",130
"131","—Loss of cattle or of boats. That was a help, but it was not a diminution of the burden of the rent.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",131
"132","34435. So that what you consider the excessive rent still remains ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",132
"133","—Certainly that is so. Is it not double what it was? That is the bare rent, and there is besides that the school rate and the poor rates, road rates and others.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",133
"134","34436. You say that upon one square mile of the poorest land in Ross there are forty-six families. Do you consider your own land the poorest land in the island ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",134
"135","—We consider it as poor land as there is in the Ross or in Argyllshire.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",135
"136","34437. What do you consider the best land in the Ross ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",136
"137","—That is a thing I cannot touch, because it does not belong to me to do so.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",137
"138","34438. You might give us the information ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",138
"139","—The large farmers in the Ross have the best lands, in my opinion.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",139
"140","34439. What are the names of their farms?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",140
"141","—Scoor, Fiden, Knockvaolagan, Ardalanish, Ardachy.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",141
"142","34440. You say there are forty-six families on this square mile. Have all these land ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",142
"143","—No, they have not.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",143
"144","34441. How many of them have land?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",144
"145","—I am not aware that there is any of them that has not some small bit of land, except those on the poor",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",145
"146","roll, unless two or three.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",146
"147","34442. How many of them would you call crofters ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",147
"148","—Formerly, when it had its old boundaries, there were twenty-four crofts; now there are only eighteen.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",148
"149","34443. And all the rest of the families have just a small bit of land or none at all?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",149
"150","—Yes, all of them have some little bit of land, except three or four, unless those on the poor roll.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",150
"151","34444. How did such a large number of people without crofts come in ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",151
"152","—They gathered there when they were removed from other places, and there was fishing near it.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",152
"153","34445. What other places were they removed from?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",153
"154","—They came from some of the farms that have been depopulated throughout the country.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",154
"155","34446. What places are these?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",155
"156","—I cannot name them accurately, and therefore would rather not attempt it.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",156
"157","34447. Was Fiden crofted in your time ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",157
"158","—No.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",158
"159","34448. How long is it ago since it was made a farm ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",159
"160","—As far back as the memory of anybody can go, it was occupied by a gentleman.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",160
"161","34449. What do you consider a double croft to be worth yourself ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",161
"162","—I would say that the rent that was paid thirty years ago, when it was first raised, was quite sufficient It was as much as we could do then to make ends meet.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",162
"163","34450. Don't you think that a croft is worth more now than it was in the year 1850?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",163
"164","—I don't think a croft now is worth so much as it was in 1850. It does not yield the same crop as it did then. In proof of that, there are some in our township who have not sent any corn to the mill for twenty years ; and those of them who were able to send corn to be ground had to buy as much again for seed.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",164
"165","34451. May they not be giving more of the fodder to the stock than in former times ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",165
"166","—They must give more fodder to them, because they have not the pasture they had before, and the crofts do not yield sufficient to feed them. This year itself many of them were much in debt, yet their cattle were in such poor condition that they could not make any market of them.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",166
"167","34452. But don't you think that in ordinary years, for the last five years or so, that a croft was worth more than thirty years ago ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",167
"168","—I don't think so.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",168
"169","34453. What is the condition this year of those who have no crofts ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",169
"170","—They were getting work throughout the country, and there was help coming from the south.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",170
"171","34454. Were they so poor that it was necessary to get help for them from the outside this year?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",171
"172","—It seems that that was the case, because there were very few who had a single potato out of their crop of last year.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",172
"173","34455. I suppose this was felt most by the very small crofters and those who had no land at all ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",173
"174","—Yes, of course; because, with their large rents, when they had no produce out of the ground, they suffered more.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",174
"175","34456. What part of the shore do you border upon; is it upon the Sound of Iona?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",175
"176","—Yes.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",176
"177","34457. It is there the fishermen are ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",177
"178","—Yes.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",178
"179","34458. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",179
"180","—Was any improvement made on your croft by the landlord before your rent was raised in 1850?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",180
"181","—He did nothing before that, but since that time there has been some drainage done ; and we pay the interest of that for the last twenty years, and that is added to our rent. It is included in our rent at present",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",181
"182","34459. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",182

"184","— Yes.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",184
"185","34460. How many crofters are there upon the Duke's estate here ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",185
"186","—I cannot tell.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",186
"187","34461. Will there be about fifty ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",187
"188","— More than fifty, I think.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",188
"189","34462. Do they occupy much of the land, or shall we say half of the land, belonging to the Duke ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",189
"190","—No.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",190
"191","34463. Is the great bulk of the population upon the Duke's estate upon the crofters' land ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",191
"192","—Yes.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",192
"193","34464. Will there be one hundred souls altogether upon the big farms ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",193
"194","—I cannot spy.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",194
"195","34465. Is there anybody living upon them except those necessary to work the farms ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",195
"196","—Yes, there are others; a few who may be paupers.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",196
"197","34466. Was the taking away of the ground by Mr Campbell a permanent impoverishment of this township ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",197
"198","—It was.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",198
"199","34467. Was there any reason whatever, so far as known to you, why the land should not have been given back when it was in the Duke's own hands ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",199
"200","—I don't know any reason.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",200
"201","34468. Your rents have been raised nearly to double from time to time. What object was there in raising the rents ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",201
"202","—I cannot tell the object.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",202
"203","34469. Speaking generally, now, about the crofters iu Mull, do you know that there is any rule to the effect that when a man dies, leaving a widow with a son not twenty-one years of age, she must remove?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",203
"204","—In some cases they were getting land, and in other cases the widow and her children were turned out.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",204
"205","34470. But was it a thing that was generally understood as a rule or regulation on the estate that widows in these circumstances must remove ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",205
"206","—It was said so, that when the husband died the widow was no longer to retain the croft; and I myself knew an instance in which this was done.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",206
"207","34471. Do you know a person of the name of Widow M'Phail?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",207
"208","—I know the woman ; I am not very near her, but I heard about her. There are persons present who were nearer to her.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",208
"209","34472. Are there any delegates present who know the circumstances ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",209
"210","—Yes, there are some here from the same town.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",210
"211","34473. What are their names ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",211
"212","—Duncan M'Lean and Lachlan Macdonald.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",212
"213","34474. What is the name of the place?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",213
"214","—Ardtun.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",214
"215","34475. Has the policy of the estate since the time of Mr Campbell been to impoverish the crofting population in the Ross of Mull ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",215
"216","—Yes; since the time of Mr Campbell the rent has been greatly increased, and that always tends to impoverish the crofters.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",216
"217","34476. Except the little drainage that you referred to, can you state anything that has been done by the proprietor for the benefit of the crofters ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",217
"218","—I cannot say anything, but the provision made in special cases of loss.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",218

"220","—Yes, we are together.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",220
"221","34478. But your name does not appear in the valuation roll ; can you explain that ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",221
"222","—The reason why one only appears in the valuation roll is, that we could not have both a vote to send a member to Parliament, and the land had to appear in the name of one.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",222
"223","34479. Is your brother older than you?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",223
"224","—Yes.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",224
"225","34480. But in reality the croft belongs to you both ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",225
"226","—Yes. The receipt for the rent is only in the name of one.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",226
"227","34481. Did you think the right of voting a very important one?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",227
"228","—I think nothing of it.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",228

"230","—I am quite sure of that as long as he is of the mind he is of now.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",230
"231","34483. But the Duke of Argyll did his best to put you out of the farm, did he not, when he struck your name out of the roll ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",231
"232","—I don't know what was in the Duke's mind, but I did not view what was done in that light.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",232
"233","344S4. You were quite willing to let the matter be settled so ?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",233
"234","—I was.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",234
"235","34485. Was your concurrence asked to allow this change to be made?",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",235
"236","—Yes, the request was made of myself; my brother was not present; but I fully concurred in what was to be done.",574,"Allan Mcinnes","Argyll, Bunessan, Mull",236
