"1","ANGUS M'FIE, Crofter, Island of Flodda (70)—examined.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",1
"2","11831. The Chairman.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected a delegate ",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",3
"4","—Freely elected.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",4
"5","11832. Have you got a statement to make?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",5
"6","—I have no written statement.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",6
"7","11833. Then you will make your statement verbally ; what have you got to say ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",7
"8","—It has become impossible for us to live where we are. I have been settled in heather land for the last twenty-one years. I have been reclaiming this heather land as well as I can. Now I have been rented by the ground officers, and before I went there this same land belonged to the people of Island Flodda. I was settled there along with three others, and there was another family there before we were settled there, and the land we occupied was rented at £9 before we were settled there. The ground officer cut off crofts for the three, but the people of the Island of Flodda who formerly possessed this ground received in compensation, or as favour, a road to their peat mosses and also to water their cattle. The people of Island Flodda had formerly the right to the land upon which we were settled. The people of Island Flodda were rented on account of this road which was made to their peat mosse3. They had to pay £ 1 a piece on account of this road to their peat mosses. Instead of the £9 which was the original rent paid for this particular piece of ground—formerly possessed by people who emigrated to America—their rents were raised to £18 when we were settled upon it. Our lands were lotted by order of the proprietor. The whole of the island of Beubecula was alloted in this",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",8
"9","way except Island Flodda and a portion of land occupied by us. A poor man from the district of Uachdar, who had no land in his own particular neighbourhood, was removed from the said district, and four acres of my lands taken from me and given to this poor man, as also a portion of road to the peat mosses formerly mentioned. I am of opinion that a proper valuation would fix the value of this same outroad at something like 30s annually, instead of £1 per family according to the present charge. On account of this removal from my own holding of four acres, I desire to get an equivalent of reduction in my rent, but I have been refused, and",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",9
"10","the former rent is still existing. ",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",10
"11","11834. Mr Cameron.—You have explained to us your own grievance; we want to know what the people who have sent you here complain of, and what remedy they wish ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",11
"12","—We are all afflicted with the same disease.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",12
"13","11835. Are they all in the same position as yourself?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",13
"14","—All in the same position. The country is not lotted in proper proportions, and a few people may be better off than the general, but only a few. ",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",14
"15","11836. Have the crofters whom you represent any hill pasture?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",15
"16","—Only heather.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",16
"17","11837. What stock do they keep on this common grazing ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",17
"18","—I have two cows and a two-year-old.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",18
"19","11838. Is that the ordinary quantity belonging to the other crofters?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",19
"20","—No, that is not the usual summing.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",20
"21","11839. What is the usual summing?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",21
"22","—According as they are able to maintain them.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",22
"23","11840. What does it practically amount to as a rule ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",23
"24","—Some have three cows and some have four cows, but it is rare to have four.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",24
"25","11841. What is the rent you yourself pay?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",25
"26","—I am paying £3, 15s. of rent including taxes. The rent itself is £3, 10s.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",26
"27","11842. Have you any other stock besides cattle?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",27
"28","—I have seven ewes this year.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",28
"29","11843. Any horses?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",29
"30","—I have one horse.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",30
"31","11844. Have the other crofters got a horse each?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",31
"32","—Yes.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",32
"33","11845. Do the other crofters pay about the same as you pay?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",33
"34","—Some pay £6, some pay £5, and some £ 1 , 10s.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",34
"35","11846. Do they want more arable land, or do they want more pastureland, or both ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",35
"36","—I want both, but, though increased, how could I stock it when I am empty ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",36
"37","11847. Is there any land in the neighbourhood that is available for you and your neighbours ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",37
"38","—Only heather ground.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",38
"39","11848. What do you propose if there is no land suitable for the crofters, and, even if there were, if they have no stock to put upon it ? What remedy should you suggest ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",39
"40","—I will tell you that if it can be done. We have a big tack at Benbecula, and I consider it the cream of the island. This one tack would improve every poor family in Benbecula, and still leave enough to support in comfort the one family that presently occupies it.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",40
"41","11849. Do you propose that the whole body of the crofters whom you represent should be moved bodily on to this tack ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",41
"42","—I mean that the one who cannot live upon his present holding should get an increase. If two or three of the present crofters on Island Flodda were removed, it would relieve the pressure on those families remaining. ",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",42
"43","11850. But I understood the land of Island Flodda was so bad that it was of no use for any one to cultivate. Is that so ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",43
"44","—It is so, being cropped during the last eighty years, continuous cropping has exhausted it.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",44
"45","11851. Do you think nothing would remedy the condition of the crofters but what you have suggested ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",45
"46","—I know no other remedy.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",46
"47","11852. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",47
"48","—Where did you come from twenty-one years ago ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",48
"49","—I was born in this township, and lived in it for twenty-seven years.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",49
"50","11853. What is the name of the township ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",50
"51","—Torlum. I married when I was twenty-seven years of age.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",51
"52","11854. Was there no room for you in the place where you were?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",52
"53","—I myself with a friend had purchased a croft in Liniclate; we remained twelve years upon that croft; but we were compelled, when our families increased, to separate the one of us from the other, and look out for some",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",53
"54","other part. ",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",54
"55","11855. What do you mean by purchasing a croft?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",55
"56","—We purchased the houses with the land. They call that a possession.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",56
"57","11856. Is it the custom to pay the outgoing tenant for houses ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",57
"58","— It was the custom at the time I refer to.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",58
"59","11857. When you left did you sell your house again?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",59
"60","—I did not. I received nothing for the house which I left behind me.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",60
"61","11858. If it was the custom of the country, why did not you sell your house ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",61
"62","—It was promised to us, but the promise was not implemented.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",62
"63","11859. Who promised it?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",63
"64","—Mr Birnie, the late factor, promised that I should receive the value of these houses from the incoming tenant, but the incoming tenant proved to be so poor tbat he was unable to implement his promise.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",64
"65","11860. Was the factor always aware that money was paid by the incoming tenant for houses ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",65
"66","—He was aware of it.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",66
"67","11861. Does that custom still continue?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",67
"68","—No, except by private agreement",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",68
"69","11862. The factor has nothing to do with it ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",69
"70","—If we come to a private arrangement, the factor takes nothing to do with it.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",70
"71","11863. The land you have at Flodda you improved entirely yourself ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",71
"72","—Every inch of it",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",72
"73","11864. What was the rent you paid when you went there?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",73
"74","—£3, 10s. When I removed to Island Flodda two ground officers were ordered to measure out my piece of land, and also to value it. These two ground officers valued it at £ 4 ; but a different factor, Mr Rule, said he considered it really too dear himself, being a piece of wild moorland, and that he would take 10s. off, leaving it £3, 10s. ",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",74
"75","11865. Then the £3, 10s. included the right to graze these cattle of which you have spoken of?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",75
"76","—It includes the grazing of the cattle on the heather.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",76
"77","11866. Has your rent ever been raised?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",77
"78","—No, but portions of my land were taken and let to others, and I still pay the former rent.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",78
"79","11867, Was that land improved that was taken from you?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",79
"80","—It was improved.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",80
"81","11868. Did four acres come off?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",81
"82","—Yes.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",82
"83","11869. Was that improved and reclaimed land?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",83
"84","—Every inch of it.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",84
"85","11870. And how much reclaimed land have you now left?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",85
"86","—I believe I am left with 12 acres of improvable land at present.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",86
"87","11871. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",87
"88","—How many souls are there upon the island of Flodda ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",88
"89","—It is composed of six crofts.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",89
"90","11872. How many cottars ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",90
"91","—Nearly as many more cottars.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",91
"92","11873. How many heads of families are there ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",92
"93","—There are at least ten heads of families, but there are crofts which have three families upon them and crofts that have two.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",93
"94","11874. What is the name of the place where there is a big tack on the island ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",94
"95","—Nunton.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",95
"96","11875. Is that the only large tack in Benbecula?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",96
"97","—The only one.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",97
"98","11876. You are an old man. Has the farm of Nunton been added to, in your own time, at the expense of land once held by crofters ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",98
"99","—No.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",99
"100","11877. Was it at any time?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",100
"101","—Yes; it will be about thirty years since there was an addition to this tack of Nunton.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",101
"102","11878. Then, of course, you must recollect it quite well ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",102
"103","—I remember it perfectly well.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",103
"104","11879. Can you mention the names of any townships in your own lifetime that have been diminished and added to Nunton ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",104
"105","—Yes; some land was taken off Balvannich and the township of Aird. I may also say Uachdar.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",105
"106","11880. Any more ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",106
"107","—I am not aware of any more.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",107
"108","11881. Was it all done at one time, or at different times?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",108
"109","—When the tack was originally cut by the late Dr M'Leod, the Balvannich people were promised compensation for a piece of moorland which belonged to them before that year, and which was added to the tack of Nunton.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",109
"110","11882. Who was the factor at the time that the whole was done ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",110
"111","—Dr M'Leod.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",111
"112","11883. Was Dr M'Leod factor for Clanranald or factor for Colonel Gordon at that time ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",112
"113","—For Colonel Gordon.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",113
"114","11884. Have many people been entirely put out of the island, in your recollection, against their will ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",114
"115","—Yes.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",115
"116","11885. Mention the townships from which people were put against their will ?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",116
"117","—I cannot mention the townships, but I can mention the moor.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",117
"118","11886. What moor was it?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",118
"119","—They were hiding themselves in caves and dens for fear of being removed.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",119
"120","11887. Where from?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",120
"121","—Scarraleod. I remember of no other place in Benbecula.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",121
"122","11888. Is there any other witness that knows about these matters better than you do?",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",122
"123","—I have no doubt but there may be.",204,"Angus Mcfie","Benbecula, Torlum",123
