"1","GEORGE MACDONALD, Crofter, Lairg (50)—examined.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",1
"2","38995, The Chairman.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",2
"3","—Have you been elected a delegate by the people of Lairg?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",3
"4","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",4
"5","38996. What is the name of the township?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",5
"6","—Rheanbreck. ",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",6
"7","38997. Have you a paper to read?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",7
"8","—Yes. ' I am a native of this parish, and have always resided in it. I occupy the croft which my mother held, for which she only paid 2s. 6d. until I improved some of the waste ground to arable land; it was rented to her at £1 then; and when I got my name in the rental book it was rented at £3, and now I pay £4. I am put forward to represent Rheanbreok and Tomich district, in which there are twenty crofters. We have to complain of the smallness of our holdings, especially of Rheanbreck. Of late years the railway passed through our lots, and deprived us of part of the best of our land, and that without any reduction of rent or compensation for our labour; but the following summer we were made to pay for the grass growing inside the fence opposite each croft, so that we pay double rent for that portion where the railway went through. Then iu 1871 nine of us were deprived of the lower parts of our lots to the average of about three or four acres each, of which a good deal was under cultivation, for which we received no compensation or reduction of rent, but three who got a few shilling off their rent. This land taken from us was for the new farm of Ballone. The land in our township has a northern exposure, and was valued some years ago at a higher rate per acre than the southern exposure on the opposite side of the valley; some of us being valued at about 14s. per acre, and the opposite side, which is much better land for crops, at about 12s. per acre. The rent of Rheanbreck is £57. We had to pay last year for meal, £119, 10s.; for seed oats, £20, 13s.; hay and straw for wintering, £30, 18s.; lime for land, £19, 6s.; manure for land, £2, 18s.; outlay, £250, 5s. Our income for cattle sold, £67, 10s.; sheep sold, £7, 10s.; pigs sold, £6,10s. ; —income £81,10s .;  deficiency, £168, 15s. To make up this deficiency we have to work wherever we get it to do, and what we earn elsewhere is swallowed up to keep our lots and families together. Both townships have too little pasture, and the grazing on it is very inferior, and the stock on it the same; as it is surrounded by sheep farms, and there being no march fence between us and the farms, our stock do not get the same justice as they would if there was a fence. Should we make improvements on houses or land, we have no guarantee that we can reap the benefit of such labour, as we have no hold upon our lots further than the good-will of the proprietor, and we can get no compensation for such improvements if we were to leave.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",8
"9","38998. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",9
"10","—Who holds the land upon the south slope?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",10
"11","—Other crofters or tenants.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",11
"12","38999. And they have their land cheaper?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",12
"13","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",13
"14","39000. Do you object to their holding their land so cheap?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",14
"15","—No, but I object to the rent of our own, for it is of different quality.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",15
"16","39001. Is the land worse on your side, or is it only the exposure?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",16
"17","—The land is worse. The climate is bad and the soil is bad.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",17
"18","39002. Sheriff Nicolson.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",18
"19","—You are on the south side?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",19
"20","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",20
"21","39003. Are Rheanbreck and Tomich both on that side ?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",21
"22","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",22
"23","39004. What is the name of the place on the other side?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",23

"25","39005. What is the size of your own croft?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",25

"28","39006. Were all these four acres taken in and cultivated by yourself?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",28
"29","—Yes, with the exception of the sowing of three bushels of oats. That is what my mother would sow.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",29
"30","39007. When she got it at 2s. 6d. how much of it was arable?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",30
"31","—None at all; it was a waste place. ",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",31
"32","39008. Was there any lease or agreement that if it were improved the rent would be kept as it was ?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",32
"33","—-Never. She was removed from another place to make a large place, and she was put there to make a living, and most that are on that side were put there for that purpose.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",33
"34","39009. Your rent is £4. Then if you have only four acres,that is £1 per acre?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",34
"35","—Yes, but I have more that I took in since that of arable land, for which I got Government money. £3 was the standard put on by the valuators, and £ 1 was put on by Government. £20 I drew out of the",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",35
"36","office for trenching.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",36
"37","39010. What is the general size of the other crofts in your neighbourhood?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",37

"40","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",40
"41","39012. How much an acre generally, do you think?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",41
"42","—We are valuing it at about 14s.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",42
"43","39013. What stock are you able to keep?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",43
"44","—Well, of the kind we have I keep two cows, but it would not keep one right cow, because the other",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",44
"45","cows would not live in the place we are in for want of pasture and winter feeding.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",45
"46","39014. Have you to buy winter feeding for them?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",46
"47","—Yes; little wee Highland things.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",47
"48","39015. Are the rest of your neighbours much in the same condition?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",48
"49","—Yes, the same.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",49
"50","39016. When was that farm made to which the land was added—the farm of Ballone?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",50
"51","—In 1871, I think.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",51
"52","39017. What land was that farm made up out of?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",52
"53","—Out of the tenants' pasture and arable. On our side it was arable and pasture mixed, but on the Ballone side it was pasture.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",53
"54","39018. Was it entirely made up of land that had been in possession of crofters?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",54
"55","—Yes, the crofters had it all in possession between them.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",55
"56","39019. What size of farm was it?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",56
"57","—I am told it was well on to 100 acres, between 80 and 90 acres.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",57

"66","39024. How much land was taken from you for the use of the railway?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",66
"67","—About one acre of arable land, but then we had more of pasture that was not cultivated at the time, and that was as good.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",67
"68","39025. Was that average taken from each croft?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",68
"69","—Some of them more. At my side there was more, and there was one man who lost nearly all he had. He had his arable land below the line, and he got a piece above it to take it out of the rocks and stones the best way he could.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",69
"70","39026. Did you make any representation to the factor as to the fact that your land was taken away and your rent not reduced?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",70
"71","—I have made a representation, and others have too, for a reduction of rent, but Mr Peacock said it was not his fault, but it was the valuator's fault, to raise the rent to that, and he could not reduce it.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",71
"72","39027. Who was the valuator?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",72
"73","—One Mr Mackenzie from Inverness.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",73

"78","39030. There are no works going on?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",78

"80","39031. Do your able-bodied men all go away from home in search of work?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",80
"81","—They must do so.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",81
"82","39032. None of them go to fish, I suppose?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",82
"83","—No.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",83
"84","39033. The Chairman.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",84
"85","—Can you tell me the history of the township of Rheanbreck ; how long has it existed, and where did the people come from?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",85
"86","—They were removed from other parts of the parish. They were not able to keep the lots they had at  the time, and they were put to that place.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",86
"87","39034. Where did they come from—from Kildonan?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",87

"121","—I am safe in saying twenty years.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",121
"122","39051. Then on what occasion was the rent raised; was it raised in consequence of the death of your mother, or how was it raised?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",122

"143","—A little over four acres.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",143
"144","39062. Then what next? Has it remained at that rent since?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",144
"145","—There is another £1 put on since for the improvement money.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",145
"146","39063. Then it is now a little more than four acres and the rent is now how much?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",146
"147","—£4, towards five acres.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",147
"148","39064. How many years is it now since your mother got it altogether?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",148
"149","—Over fifty years.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",149

"161","—Something about £10.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",161
"162","39071. Now, as to the rest of the crofters around, have they been improving the ground and building their houses and paying rents just in the same way?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",162
"163","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",163
"164","39072. That is in the township of Rheanbreck. You say that a farm has been taken out of the middle of these holdings; is the farm entirely composed of the parts of the holdings of the crofters?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",164
"165","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",165
"166","39073. Is it in the middle of them or at one side of them?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",166
"167","—On both sides. There was a water going through the centre, and the one part was on the Ballone side, and the other on the Rheanbreck side of the farm; and the farm is made up of these two sides put together; the Ballone side being pasture, and our side both pasture and arable.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",167
"168","39074. When the farm was made, was some land taken away from almost all the crofts, or from only a few of them?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",168
"169","—From the most on our side.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",169
"170","39075. When the land was taken away from the crofters to make the farm was the rent of the crofters reduced?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",170
"171","—Never a penny.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",171
"172","39076. It was never reduced at all?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",172
"173","—No.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",173
"174","39077. Now, about the common pasture; is there common pasture attached to your township?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",174
"175","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",175
"176","39078. Is it a good large common pasture?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",176
"177","—It is large, but it is not good.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",177
"178","39079. When the new farm of Ballone was formed did the farmer get a share of the common pasture of the township?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",178
"179","—Be has got a plantation that is next it, between his two farms, at the same rent, and has that for pasture.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",179
"180","39080. Did the township graze the plantation before? Was it taken away from the township?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",180
"181","—Yes, when it was planted it was taken from them.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",181
"182","39081. But did the township ever graze their cattle in the plantation when the trees grew up ?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",182
"183","—No.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",183
"184","39082. Then the farmer did not obtain any part of the common pasture?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",184
"185","—The farmer was giving it to them for so much per month for some of their cattle and horses. ",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",185
"186","39083. But when the farm was formed was it made out of the arable ground of the township, or out of both the arable ground and the pasture?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",186
"187","—Both arable and pasture. ",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",187
"188","39084. But the crofters in the township never got any compensation either for the arable or for the pasture?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",188
"189","—Never.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",189
"190","39085. Are you quite sure of that?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",190
"191","—I am certain, on our side, with the exception that two or three got a few shillings.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",191
"192","39086. But I thought that was in connection with the railway?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",192
"193","—On the low part that was taken from them.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",193
"194","39087. For the farm or the railway ?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",194
"195","—For the farm.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",195
"196","39088. When the farm was formed and ground taken away did they petition the factor; did they make any representation to the factor?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",196
"197","—I am not very sure.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",197
"198","39089. Do the people in the township consider they have lost by the formation of the farm?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",198
"199","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",199
"200","39090. It has been a loss to them?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",200
"201","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",201
"202","39091. Have they received any kind of benefit or advantage in exchange for their loss?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",202
"203","—No.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",203
"204","39092. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",204
"205","—Some of the crofters' land, you have told us, has been taken away by the railway; was any compensation given you for that?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",205
"206","—Nothing.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",206
"207","39093. Had the crofters any leases?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",207
"208","—No.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",208
"209","39094. Do you know that if you had a lease the land could not be taken away from you without compensation?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",209
"210","—Yes, we have seen a case of that kind in our neighbourhood, and when he came on them for valuation when his lease was out, he would get no more from the estate.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",210
"211","39095. But by the want of a lease here you were deprived of what the law has ordered to be given to tenants when their lands are compulsorily taken from them?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",211
"212","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",212
"213","39096. You spoke about remonstrating with Mr Peacock, the factor, on the subject, and_that he said it was the fault of the valuator; was it the crofters who appointed the valuator ?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",213
"214","—I am not very sure.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",214
"215","39097. Had they anything to do with his appointment?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",215
"216","—I don't believe it.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",216
"217","39098. In fact, there was no one to look after their interest ?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",217
"218","—Not at all. There were some lots he did not see at all. I am told he passed without looking at them.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",218
"219","39099. Considering you had not the benefit of a lease, which would be very important to you in the circumstances, I suppose you and the others expected that the people who were over you would look after your interests as well as their own?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",219
"220","—Yes, we would expect that.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",220
"221","39100. But it was not so ?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",221
"222","—No.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",222
"223","39101. Are you far from a station ?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",223
"224","—About a mile.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",224
"225","39102. I suppose the railway is of undoubted benefit to yourself and the others?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",225
"226","—Yes, in one sense.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",226
"227","39103. Have you any crossing?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",227
"228","—The low parts were taken from us, and there is no occasion for a crossing. There were crossings put in at first, and we had them for a few years, but then the land was taken for a farm and the crossings were closed.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",228
"229","39104. I suppose the best land is generally in the low part of the valley?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",229
"230","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",230
"231","39105. And the railway likes to keep as low as possible?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",231
"232","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",232
"233","39106. Am I correct in assuming that the line of railway took a fair average of your land from you?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",233
"234","—The very best of it from the one end to the other.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",234
"235","39107. And in point of fact your crofts are so small that nothing would make up for this cutting away?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",235
"236","—No.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",236
"237","39108. From your own point of view and that of the other crofters, if you were told a railway was to be made, but you would get no compensation, and that so much land was to be taken from you without any reduction, would you be satisfied to give it if it was at your disposal?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",237
"238","—No, but before then we were promised to get a reduction for it before the railway came through, but we never got it.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",238
"239","39109. Who gave the promise?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",239
"240","—A man from Dunrobin—from the Duke.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",240
"241","39110. Was it in consequence of that, that none of you offered any opposition to the railway being passed?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",241
"242","—No, not for that.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",242
"243","39111. Still you were glad to hear you were going to get compensation?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",243
"244","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",244
"245","39112. Mr Cameron.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",245
"246","—I did not quite understand how much land was taken away from each crofter by the railway?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",246
"247","—Between three and four acres; some of them three and others four —not arable land, but altogether.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",247
"248","39113. How many crofters were there who had land taken away from them?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",248
"249","—There were nine of them.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",249
"250","39114. Suppose a railway occupies ten acres to the mile, that would be 176 lineal yards for every acre. That would make a considerable mileage if you multiplied it by three or four and afterwards by nine. What is the lineal distance over which the radway runs through your crofts; I mean not only what was taken for the railway but what was taken on the low part for forming the farm?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",250
"251","—We have not measured what was taken for the railway, but very much more than was required, for  the fence has come out too far on our cultivated land.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",251
"252","39115. You talk about having to go to work to make up sufficient to maintain your family; where do you get work?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",252
"253","—The best way we can,—here and there; not in one place at all.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",253
"254","39116. In the neighbourhood here?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",254
"255","—Sometimes, according as it turns out.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",255
"256","39117. What wages are current in the district?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",256
"257","—2s. 6d. when we get it. We are as often without it as with it.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",257
"258","39118. But you speak in your paper as if it were rather a hardship to work. You do not consider it a hardship to have to work?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",258
"259","—Well, it is a hardship, for we lose the work on the crofts.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",259
"260","39119. Are you aware the great grievance in the Highlands in many places is that there is no work, and one great grievance brought before us by crofters is that the crofts are not able to maintain them, and they have to make up the difference to support themselves and their families?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",260
"261","—Well, we don't get work but very seldom since two or three years ago.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",261
"262","39120. Do any of you go to the south to get work ?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",262
"263","—Not since some years back. I was forced to go myself once or twice; but there was no work in Lairg till the reclamations commenced and the railway came on.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",263
"264","39121. But if you could get regular work in the district at 2s. 6d. a day you would not be so badly off with your crofts?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",264
"265","—No, but we do not get it except very seldom.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",265
"266","39122. Have many of you been engaged in the reclamations?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",266
"267","—Most of us.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",267
"268","39123. What do you get there?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",268
"269","—There were good wages going there.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",269
"270","39124. And that has been going on for some years?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",270
"271","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",271
"272","39125. So long as that lasted, it enabled you to make up the difference betweeu what you got from your croft and what was required for your family ?",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",272
"273","—Yes.",641,"George Macdonald","Sutherland, Golspie",273
