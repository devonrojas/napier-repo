"1","ALEXANDER MACKENZIE, Crofter and Fisherman, Boreraig (48)—examined.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",1
"2","7261. The Chairman.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",2
"3","—Have you been freely elected a delegate?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",3
"4","—Yes ; but I wish to say, before making any statement, that I would wish to have the assurance that the landlord would not do any hurt to me in respect of anything I may say here to-day.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",4
"5","7262. The delegate who is now before us has stated his desire to have an assurance from Dr Martin that he will not be molested on account of anything he may state here to-day ?Mr Nicol Martin, nephew of Dr Martin. ",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",5
"6","—Nothing will be done to him for anything he states, so far as my uncle and myself are concerned.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",6
"7","7263. You produce a written statement of the grievances of the Boreraig crofters?Witness.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",7
"8","—Yes.  The Grievances of the Boreraig Crofters, one township on Dr Martins Estate. To the Royal Commission of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. We complain generally of the smallness of our crofts or lots—the want of hill pasture —that we can neither keep sheep nor horses, and that we are too highly rented. When the late Mr Malcolm Nicolson became proprietor of this estate, about fifty-nine or sixty years ago, there were only twelve crofters in Boreraig,  and each tenant had then six cows, two horses, and thirty or forty sheep, and the rent for the whole township was only eighty guineas. Forty-five years ago our proprietor subdivided and cut up our twelve crofts into twenty-four different small lots, and raised the rent from £3, 10s. to  £7, 10s. The rent for the whole township is now about £130. At the same time our proprietor also deprived us of our horses, and of all our sheep except six sheep for each crofter. And besides the stock of the Galtrigill township was by him placed upon the pasture of the Boreraig township. When the former crofts were cut up into small lots tenants were brought from Waternish and Bracadale for them, and all were crowded together in this little township. When the present proprietor, Dr Martin, became proprietor, he took from us the six sheep left us by Mr Nicolson, and now we have neither sheep nor horses, and in consequence have to do all the ploughing and harrowing and a vast amount of other brutalising horse work ourselves. We have to carry sea-ware in creels on our backs in some instances for a distance, of nearly half a mile up the face of rocks and steep braes, and we have to carry the peats in the same fashion for even a longer  distance, while if we were allowed to keep horses, we would be relieved of all this slavish degradation and hardship. The summing of the lots is now only three cows, but the small patches we have now left us would be inadequate either to feed or fodder two cows, and would not keep the smallest family in the township in food for two months of the year. The land having been in perpetual cultivation for hundreds of years, is become so poor and so much reduced that it is incapable of yielding any crop except of the very poorest, and that by constant manuring. Each crofter on an average has to spend from £16 to £ 20 a year in meal, besides the produce of the farm, while in an exceptionally bad year like the present the outlay is much greater. The result is that we are for ever sunk in debt, and have to spend the greater part of the year away from home to earn money to buy food for our families, and to pay the rent for the landlords; while want of success at the fishing, or other work we go to, for even one year, means either ruin or starvation. If we had properly sized crofts at a reasonable rent and fully stocked, this alternative would never arise. Dr Martin has in his time removed four crofters from this township, and he made seven new parks from land belonging to the township, and which were within the old landmarks or boundaries of the township, and he added these parks to his own holdings. Moreover, we had to give ten days a year of free labour to Dr Martin, and to cut his corn for him with",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",8
"9","our own hooks; while a servant of Dr Martin —one William Campbell— who acted as stirk-drover, ploughman, and grieve—in performing this unlawful labour, used to make us work like slaves. The people were in perfect dread of him ; and if they did not work as hard as he wished, or were absent for a day, he would threaten them with eviction. Further, though as we said our present small patches would not keep any of us in food for two months, there are twenty-six families of us crowded together in this small township, fully twice the number the place is capable of supporting, though we had it on the old boundary lines. We consider that if we had plenty of land to live upon, at a fair rent, we would be able to live comfortably on our farm all the year round, and could stay at home to work the land and improve them, instead of as now we have to hunt after work wherever it is to be had in the south country, so that ourselves and our families can live. There is plenty of land in Skye for all the people in it, and that land which originally belonged to our own forefathers. We wish to get enough of land to enable us to keep sheep and horses, as both men and women have now to do the work of the horse, while our children and families are going naked for want of wool to make clothes, and we are too poor to buy both wool and meal for our families. We would be quite content if we had as much land as would keep us comfortably, and also that we had fixity of tenure or security against arbitrary removal; that we would get compensation for any improvement we make on houses or land.

"12","[Dr Martin.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",12
"13","—I take the opportunity of saying, that no one will be molested in consequence of anything that is said to-day. I never moved a man from my estates if he paid his debts, and if he had not been complained of by his neighbours. I never issued a letter of removal for the last seven years.]",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",13
"14","7264. Have you any further statement to make ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",14
"15","—No.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",15
"16","7265. The paper you have given in states there were originally twelve crofts ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",16
"17","—Yes.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",17
"18","7266. And that they were divided into twenty-four ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",18
"19","—Yes; forty-five years ago I think.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",19
"20","7267. At the time they were divided into twenty-four—forty-five years ago —as I understand, they were deprived of horses and sheep ? ",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",20
"21","—Six sheep were left to us.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",21
"22","7268. Was the hill pasture taken away at that time ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",22
"23","—No, but it was taken from the Galtrigill people, and the people of Galtrigill were crowded upon us.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",23
"24","7269. Then subsequently the sheep were taken away ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",24
"25","—Six sheep were taken from us.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",25
"26","7270. After the first division into twenty-four shares, then the summing was three cows, no horses, and six sheep ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",26
"27","—Yes.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",27
"28","7271. What was the rent then ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",28
"29","—From £3, 10s. to £7, 10s.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",29
"30","7272. Why was there so great a difference ? Was that owing to the different amount of arable ground on the different crofts ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",30
"31","—The valuator of the land thought that some crofts were bettor than others.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",31
"32","7273. Then when the six sheep were taken away, by whom were they taken away ? Were they taken away by the last proprietor or by the present proprietor ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",32
"33","—By Dr Martin.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",33
"34","7274. When the six sheep were taken away was the rent reduced ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",34
"35","—No.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",35
"36","7275. How long is it since Dr Martin became proprietor of the estate ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",36
"37","—I am not sure, but I think it is up to forty years.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",37
"38","7276. During the last forty years, since Dr Martin became proprietor of the estate, has the rent been raised ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",38
"39","—Eight years ago it was raised.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",39
"40","7277. How much was it raised?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",40
"41","—My rent was raised £1 at all events, and I think the rent of most of us was raised to the same extent. But when I paid my rent at last Martinmas that £1 was taken off, but I am not sure if that reduction will continue.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",41
"42","7278. How many years was the additional £1 exacted ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",42
"43","—-About seven years.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",43
"44","7279. Since you remember, has anybody been evicted from the township?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",44
"45","—I cannot say that I do remember any except the four of whom the paper speaks.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",45
"46","7280. Why were the four removed ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",46
"47","—Their holdings were added to the park which Dr Martin has in his own hands.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",47
"48","7281. And what became of those four families ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",48
"49","—Two of them went to Waternish, and I think the doctor himself gave a place to the other two.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",49
"50","7282. Was any compensation made to them in connection with their removal ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",50
"51","—I cannot tell.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",51
"52","7283. But supposing the £1 additional rent to be reduced, as it has been this year, you sit at the same rent you did forty-five years ago ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",52
"53","—Yes",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",53
"54","7284. Has the value of the croft diminished in the course of these forty-five years ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",54
"55","—Yes. The croft is not to-day half what it was worth forty-five years ago.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",55
"56","7285. What is the reason of that ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",56
"57","—Turning the ground so often. Forty-five years ago there was a good depth of sod on our ground, but",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",57
"58","now we have no more than from two inches to six inches in depth —the deepest is six inches.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",58
"59","7286. Have you any complaint about the peats or about the sea ware ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",59
"60","—We are complaining that the peats are far from us, but the landlord cannot help that; and as to sea-ware, we are bringing it across the loch, a distance of four or five miles.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",60
"61","7287. Sheriff Nicolson.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",61
"62","—Where from?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",62
"63","—From Claggan.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",63
"64","7288. The Chairman.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",64
"65","—Is there any charge made for that ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",65
"66","—Yes, we pay for it.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",66
"67","7289. To whom do you pay for it ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",67
"68","—To MLeod of MLeod.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",68
"69","7290. Have they any sea-ware upon their own lands?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",69
"70","—Not enough.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",70
"71","7291. Have they any complaint to make now at all about labour or services which they are obliged to render to the landlord ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",71
"72","—We cannot say that he demanded labour of us during the past year, unless we chose to give it.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",72
"73","7292. Does he oblige them to make any money payment instead of the labour that used to be exacted?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",73
"74","—No, he did not ask any money off me the last time I paid my rent.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",74
"75","7293. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",75
"76","—Was there any truth in the report that some years ago they were obliged to sell fish, or fish so many days for the proprietor ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",76
"77","—We gave our fish to him, but there was no obligation upon us as to the time we fished.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",77
"78","7294. And therefore you did not consider that a hardship ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",78
"79","—No, but our cause of complaint was the smallness of the price we got for our fish. We were not getting the price for it.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",79
"80","7295. From the landlord ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",80
"81","—Yes, it was the landlord who was taking it from us, but the landlord has ceased that now.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",81
"82","7296. Is there good fishing ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",82
"83","—No, there is no fishing at all.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",83
"84","7297. Did there used to be fishing ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",84
"85","—About forty years ago it was good fishing ground, but since then, except in occasional years, we could not make what would keep us in shoes, or in long lines.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",85
"86","7298. Have the people any other grievance than what is stated in the paper?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",86
"87","—No, I dont think we have; but there is plenty there itself.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",87
"88","7299. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",88
"89","—Do they refuse to pay their rents now ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",89
"90","—I paid my rent. I think every one in the township in which I am have paid their rents, but I am not sure.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",90
"91","7301. What are they claiming from Dr Martin just now?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",91
"92","—They want more land. Our places are so small that we cannot live by them.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",92
"93","7302. Has he more land conveniently to give to them?-",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",93
"94","—There is land no doubt, but I am not sure. The doctor has not on his property as much land as would do for all the people on his property.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",94
"95","7303. Then what would they expect him to do for them ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",95
"96","—We are thinking there is plenty land in the island of Skye if we only got it.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",96
"97","7304. Sheriff Nicolson",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",97
"98","—There used to be very good fishing at Boreraig and Galtrigill ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",98
"99","—Yes, but that is gone",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",99
"100","7305. What is the reason of it?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",100
"101","—Well, I have noticed that since the Barra herring fishing commenced we have had no fishing.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",101
"102","7306. But how has the Barra fishing affected the cod and ling fishing of Galtrigill ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",102
"103","—The dead herring that fall out the nets of the fishermen at Barra are enticing the cod and ling to remain about these places.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",103
"104","7307. Did not they ask Dr Martin to open the fish house which he shut up in consequence of the badness of the fishing ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",104
"105","—I dont know but that that was the case some years ago.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",105
"106","7308. But for some time he has not been taking the fish at all ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",106
"107","—Not for a year or two.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",107
"108","7309. Is there anybody else about here that takes the fish from them ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",108
"109","—Yes.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",109
"110","7310. Who ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",110
"111","—The post-master at Dunvegan.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",111
"112","7311. What price do you get for the cod and ling ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",112
"113","—In winter 5d. for the cod, and 8d. for the ling.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",113
"114","7312. Had you a complaint against the doctor for the price he was giving for the fish ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",114
"115","—I believe we had.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",115
"116","7313. What was he giving?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",116
"117","—4d. for the cod, and 6d. for the ling.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",117
"118","7314. And it seems it did not pay him notwithstanding ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",118
"119","—I cannot say about that.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",119
"120","7313. At any rate he shut up the house ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",120
"121","—Yes.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",121
"122","7316. Would you be the better of a good pier at Boreraig? Would it be worth while making one ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",122
"123","—Not so far as concerns the fishing.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",123
"124","7317. Would it be any benefit in any other respect ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",124
"125","—I dont know what convenience it would be unless it would be convenient for the people to land the sea-ware.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",125
"126","7318. Then you are contented so far as the sea is concerned?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",126
"127","—Yes, so far as the fishing is concerned.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",127
"128","7319. Have you any complaint about the post-office there ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",128
"129","—We would be the better of a post certainly, for the post does not come further than Husabost, and it goes there for the sake of the doctor.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",129
"130","7320. And where do you get your letters ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",130
"131","—Our two townships pay a post-runner from Husabost to ourselves.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",131
"132","7321. With regard to the price of the fish, did not the doctor raise the price one year ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",132
"133","—Yes, that was when the £1 was added to our rents. We got one penny of rise in the price of the fish when the £1 was laid upon our rents, but this increase in the price of the fish did not last for more than one winter, while the increase on the rents remained.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",133
"134","7322. The Chairman.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",134
"135","—When the people were brought in from Galtrigill what was done with the land at Galtrigill which was cleared ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",135
"136","—It is in the hands of the landlord for his sheep. Mr Nicolson, the present landlords predecessor, had it under sheep.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",136
"137","7323. Is it stilt under sheep ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",137
"138","—Yes.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",138
"139","7324. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",139
"140","—In regard to the fishing, you said that the Barra fishing, you thought, had a prejudicial effect. How old is the Barra fishing ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",140
"141","—It is many a year. I am not sure. ",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",141
"142","7325. Has the Barra fishing anything to do with the scarcity of herring on the Skye coast ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",142
"143","—Yes, and it has to do with the scarcity in the Lewis  also. Before the Lewis fishing commenced there was plenty of herring to be got here.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",143
"144","7326. Do I understand that the fishing of the Lewis or in the outer islands is supposed to injure them before they come to the coast of Skye ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",144
"145","—That is what we think.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",145
"146","7327. Is that a view generally entertained?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",146
"147","—Yes, we could not account for the scarcity of fish here in any other way.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",147
"148","7328. Is this consideration a new thing, or is it a matter of years standing?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",148
"149","—It is a long time since we were thinking of it, after we could think of no other cause. In my fathers time fish were very plentiful.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",149
"150","7329. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",150
"151","—There are two Alexander Mackenzies in the township? What is your rent?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",151
"152","—About £6 of rent after this reduction of £1.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",152
"153","7330. What arable land have you got ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",153
"154","—I think, if half of my arable land were laid upon the other half, it would make three acres.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",154
"155","7331. And what is the summing of your stock ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",155
"156","—Three cows, but I cannot keep three cows on it.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",156
"157","7332. What have you actually got ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",157
"158","—Two cows.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",158
"159","7333. How many year-olds ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",159
"160","—I have one two-year-old and one stirk.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",160
"161","7334. Does your summing include any young beasts ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",161
"162","—The summing is three cows.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",162
"163","7335. What do you get from your croft ? Do you sow any bere ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",163
"164","—No, barley would not grow upon it.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",164
"165","7336. How much oats do you sow ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",165
"166","—About five bolls. The land which we have requires double the quantity of seed that other land requires.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",166
"167","7337. Five bolls. How many barrels of seed would that be ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",167
"168","—I think it would make about six barrels of the sort of oats which we have ourselves.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",168
"169","7338. And what return do you have for that ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",169
"170","—The best land that we have will yield about one bushel and a half, and other parts will not",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",170
"171","return what is sown.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",171
"172","7339. Do you thresh it ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",172
"173","—Yes.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",173
"174","7340. Do you take any of it to the mill ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",174
"175","—Very little.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",175
"176","7341. What meal will you make in an average year?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",176
"177","—If I gave justice to my cattle, I could not make any meal.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",177
"178","7342. You give the most of it to the cattle ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",178
"179","—Yes.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",179
"180","7343. How much potatoes do you plant ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",180
"181","—Six barrels.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",181
"182","7344. What return do you get for that?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",182
"183","—About thirty-two. That would be the best year.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",183
"184","7345. Does that include the seed and all ? Is the seed to come out of that next year ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",184
"185","—Yes.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",185
"186","7346. Then you will only got twenty-six barrels for use ?",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",186
"187","—The best year.",137,"Alexander Mackenzie","Skye, Glendale",187
