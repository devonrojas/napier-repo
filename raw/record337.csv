"1","LACHLAN CAMPBELL, Crofter, Scadabay (43)—examined.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",1
"2","18129. The Chairman.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",2
"3","—How many families are there at Scadabay?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",3
"4","—Eighteen.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",4
"5","18130. How many paying rent?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",5
"6","—Six are in the rent-roll.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",6
"7","18131. Are you sent here on behalf of the whole eighteen ?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",7
"8","—Yes.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",8
"9","18132. What have you got to say for them?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",9
"10","—The same story which they all have, and the same complaint. My father came to Scadabay forty years ago, and then there were six in the place. They were quite well off, and quite independent, when these six had the place. Then the families increased, and they must needs marry, and they married ; and when a man married he required to get a house, and there was no place for him to build it except upon his father's lot. And so the town is now swelled up to eighteen families. The eighteen are making their living on the place; that is to say, each of them has a bit of the land that there is. They are each taking a share in the cultivation of the place, and so far taking a living out of it. Now this has reduced the whole of them to the same impoverished condition, and if they fall back during the next fifteen years to the same extent that they have done during the last forty, they will all be on the poor roll. Some whose names are upon the rent roll have only two sheep and two cows.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",10
"11","18133. Has the rent of the township been changed in the last forty years ?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",11
"12","—I am not aware that it has.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",12
"13","18134. Has the extent of land been diminished ?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",13
"14","—No.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",14
"15","18135. Have any families been brought into the township ?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",15
"16","—No.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",16
"17","18136. And forty years ago they were comfortable?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",17
"18","—Yes.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",18
"19","18137. What rent are you paying?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",19
"20","—£4, 12s., without taxes.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",20
"21","18138. What stock do you keep ?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",21
"22","—Three milk cows, three young ones, and twenty-five head of sheep, excluding lambs.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",22
"23","18139. Mr Fraser-Mackintosh.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",23
"24","—Whose estate are you on?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",24
"25","—Lord Dunmore's.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",25
"26","18140. Is there any land near you that you could get?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",26
"27","—No, we are tacked on together—a crofter population. It is crofters that adjoin us. ",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",27
"28","18141. What is the nearest place in the proprietor's lands, or in the hands of the big tacksmen?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",28
"29","—Cuidinish, Deirecleit, and Ceandevig.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",29
"30","18142. Sheriff Nicolson.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",30
"31","—There is no cause, then, for the crowding of the people of Scadabay in the place, except that they insisted on marrying when they were young ?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",31
"32","—No other reason ; but what else could they do, if they could get no additional place to occupy?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",32
"33","18143. Were they not getting work in the south?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",33
"34","—Yes, they need that, but cannot take much out of it. Every person cannot bring home money from the south by his earnings.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",34
"35","18144. Would it not be better for a young man to go and try his fortune away from home, than to sit, and marry, and beget children, on a miserable bit of land here ?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",35
"36","—It would be better to have a good comfortable living at home, than to risk the chance of straying abroad. It is not every man who could make a comfortable living by shifting about in that way.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",36
"37","18145. Then, I suppose, no young man ever leaves Harris with any intention of staying out of it?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",37
"38","—Not of their own will, if they have a place to which to return.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",38
"39","18146. Do you not know that noblemen and gentlemen are obliged to send away their sons wherever they can make a living for them ?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",39
"40","—Yes, but they send them away with plenty of money to get homes and lands for them elsewhere; and sometimes lucrative appointments, when they become gentlemen.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",40
"41","18147. But do you not know that many gentlemen's sons have been sent abroad without a penny in their pocket except what paid their passage?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",41
"42","—If such a case occurred, money would be sent after him.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",42
"43","18148. Then do you think the crofters are the only people who are entitled to keep their sons at home ?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",43
"44","—Well, we poor people sending our family away without perhaps as much money as will pay their passage, with insufficient clothing, and no education, often fear they may fare badly, and that worse may befall them. They must buy clothes with the first wages they earn, and the first £1 they can spare must be sent home to keep their father and mother alive.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",44
"45","18149. Is that any hardship ?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",45
"46","—It is only those that try it that feel the hardship of it.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",46
"47","18150. Do you not know that a great many of the officers in Her Majesty's army and navy, sons of noblemen and gentlemen, are barely able to keep themselves in clothes, and are not able to marry, perhaps all their lives?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",47
"48","—They will not have to support their fathers and mothers though, and they will not have to pay the rent of the small patch of land their father possesses.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",48
"49","18151. But that only applies to the case of a man with one son. Where there are several sons, do they all need to support their father and mother ?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",49
"50","—Where there is only one son, he must needs remain at home to till the ground.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",50
"51","18152. Quite right; but should not the rest go away, and should not they be content to be bachelors for a time, like other people ?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",51
"52","—No, a bachelor is an object of charity all the world over, and such a condition was not appointed to the children of men.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",52
"53","18153. Then it is the first duty of a man,—especially a Harris man,—to get married and increase the number of the inhabitants ?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",53
"54","—Yes, that is his first duty, and to get land to occupy it. These were the first commands he received.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",54
"55","18154. But that was only when there were two inhabitants in the world ?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",55
"56","—I do not know ; what is written is that ' He gave the land to the children of men.'",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",56
"57","18155. Was not the command to 'increase and multiply' given only to the first pair ?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",57
"58","—That was quite the case, but it was added —' replenish the earth.'",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",58
"59","18156. And have they not done so in Scadabay at any rate?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",59
"60","—Yes.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",60
"61","18157. Is it not time to stop now?",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",61
"62","—I do not know that it is.",337,"Lachlan Campbell","Harris, Tarbert",62
